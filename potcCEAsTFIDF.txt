However, at some point during the second half of the 16th century, Johnson joined Francis Drake's crew, participating in his operations against the Spanish in the Caribbean. Johnson was capable enough to become Drake's first mate.\n\nWhen Drake discovered Isla Cueva, a rocky island in the Caribbean Sea, he decided to hide his treasure there. Among the treasure were two magical stones, one purple that protects from curses, and the other white that brings fortune and eternal glory. Drake's men transported the treasure to the grotto deep inside the island, and put several traps on the way to it. Greedy and thirsting for power, Johnson attempted to betray Drake so he could take his place and keep the treasure for himself. However, Johnson's attempt failed, and he ended up dead and beheaded. His corpse was left to rot in the treasure cavern, but Drake's men took Johnson's head with them. Because of his betrayal, Johnson's bones magically became black just like his soul.\n\nMore than a century after his death, Johnson's black skull ended up in possession of the Spanish. A small piece of the skull was owned by the Spanish officer on Providence Island, but the rest of it was taken aboard the Spanish galleon that sank somewhere in the Caribbean. In the 1740s, the notorious pirate Captain Jack Sparrow stole the piece of the skull on Providence, and went to the Voodoo priestess Tia Dalma, who explained him what that black piece was.\n\nAfter some time, Jack found the rest of the skull, and took it to his cabin aboard the Black Pearl. However, when Joshamee Gibbs inserted the last piece into the skull, he turned to stone, and the skull came to life. Jack then made a deal with the talking skull, he would reunite it with the rest of the skeleton if the skull showed him the way to Drake's treasure and explains how to lift the curse from Gibbs.\n\nA day later, the Black Pearl arrived to Isla Cueva, and the crew came ashore. Cotton took Johnson's skull and carried it through the tunnel, but one trap which Johnson forgot about almost killed them. When they entered the treasure cavern, Johnson warned Jack that he can take only one of the magical stones, unless he wants the ceiling to collapse. As he took the purple stone, Jack told Cotton to attach the skull back to its skeleton.\n\nComplete once again, Johnson attacked Jack and explained that he attempted to betray Drake. Now he intended to kill Jack and take control of the Black Pearl. But Jack knocked him and trapped him inside one of the treasure chests. Jack then broke one of his skeletal fingers so he could give it to Tia Dalma as a payment, and told his men to take as much treasure as they can carry. Johnson then freed himself and took the white stone, causing the cavern to start collapsing. However, Jack and his men managed to escape in time, but without the treasure. Johnson's further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sam_Johnson"}}

He eventually joined the crew of the Wicked Wench, serving under Captain Morgan.\n\nSome time after Bowen joined the Wench's crew, the notorious Spanish capitán Armando Salazar, El Matador Del Mar, vowed to clean the seas from piracy. With his warship, the Silent Mary, and his loyal crew, Salazar destroyed dozens of ships, bringing piracy to the brink of extinction. The last pirates in the Caribbean eventually joined forces and formed a fleet in an attempt to sink the Silent Mary. The Wicked Wench was part of the fleet.\n\nIn a fierce battle off the coast of the mysterious Devil's Triangle, most of the pirate fleet was destroyed, and the Wicked Wench remained the only pirate ship left afloat. Captain Morgan was mortally wounded, and he gave command of the ship to a young pirate Jack. Jack took the helm, steering the ship towards the Triangle. With the rest of the crew Bowen followed Jack's orders to prepare the bootleg turn. Followed by the Silent Mary, the Wench changed her course at the last moment, right in front the Triangle. The Spanish had no choice but to sail right into the dark cave where the Spanish ship hit the reefs and exploded, killing the entire crew. A few moments later, Bowen gave his cutlass to Jack as a tribute, and the rest of the crew followed his example.\n\nMany years after the supposed death of Captain Salazar, Bowen was still a pirate, now serving on the Red Dragon, a ship that was part of the pirate fleet of Hector Barbossa. As the Red Dragon sailed through the ocean, Bowen went to the main deck to get a drink of water. Then, he noticed an undead seagull landing on the side of the ship.\n\nAt first, Bowen thought that he was hallucinating, seeing a rotten corpse of bird that still moved like a living creature. However, the next moment he saw the Silent Mary on the horizon. As the Mary sailed right into the starboard side of the Dragon her bow opened like the jaws of a giant sea monster. Seemingly indestructible, the Spanish ship crushed the pirate ship, cutting her in half like a razor. It is unlikely at best, that he survived, but possible, because Salazar left one survivor from each ship he destroyed to tell the tale.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bowen"}}

It was here that the Cabin Boy, along with a number of sailors and pirates, signed on to sail under Jack Sparrow.\n\nClimbing aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the Cabin Boy would work with the crewmen for the next five days, where he would work with a shanghaied Jack Sparrow. As the Revenge sailed gloriously over the ocean, the Cabin Boy would be treated decently by the other crewmen as he worked. Later, as the other crewmen were not satisfied with sailing under Angelica and her zombie crew, the Cabin Boy brought in a double-armful of swords for the crew to use in Jack's mutiny aboard the Revenge. During the mutiny, the Cabin Boy fought alongside the human crew against many of the zombies. Jack's crew almost took over the ship, until Blackbeard himself appeared on deck and hung them all with the ship's rigging. The Cabin Boy was let down, as well as the other crewmen, so that they witness the Cook's punishment.\n\nSoon, the Queen Anne's Revenge arrived to Whitecap Bay for the hunt for a mermaid, which Blackbeard needed. The Cabin Boy was put into one of the longboats, along with Philip Swift, Scrum, Ezekiel, Gunner, and Derrick. When Ezekiel realized that they were doomed, the Cabin Boy asked if sharks would come, but Ezekiel explained that they were the bait for mermaids. When one mermaid appeared and sang to the crew, more mermaids came to their presence shortly before they attacked the crew. After the mermaids destroyed the longboat, Philip was able to save the boy as they swam back ashore. The attack wasn't for nothing as the crew successfully captured one mermaid.\n\nLater, the Cabin Boy would join the crew that accompanied Blackbeard in finding the Fountain of Youth.

During the battle, the Cabin Boy liberated Philip Swift from his bonds, calling it even from his saving at Whitecap Bay, as he continued fighting bravely against Barbossa's crew. The crew continued to fight against the British soldiers, until the Spaniard and his men arrived to destroy the Fountain.

He was locked in the Dutchman's brig along with Elizabeth and the crew.\n\nHuang escaped the Flying Dutchman with the crew when James Norrington broke them free. During the battle aboard the Empress, he had his left arm in a sling; during the skirmish, he sustained some injury. Huang joined Elizabeth during the meeting at Shipwreck Cove, where she took Feng's seat. During the conclave, Barbossa maintained that they must free Calypso from her human form; upon hearing the protesting Pirate Lords, Huang maintained that Sao Feng, were he alive, would have agreed with Barbossa. At this point in time Huang seemed to have a newfound respect for Elizabeth and treated her properly as captain, this may have been because Elizabeth chose to remain with the crew in the brig than have James's quarters.\n\nHuang led the Empress in the battle against Lord Cutler Beckett's armada and survived the battle against the East India Trading Company's forces. Shortly after this, some of his men went on to be part of the Black Pearl's crew under Captain Barbossa's command. His fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tai_Huang"}}

Although they carried out their duty loyally, they proved little match for the trickery of Jack Sparrow, and ended up engaged in conversation with the pirate aboard the Interceptor. Although dutiful, they both proved incapable of rescuing Elizabeth Swann when she fell from atop the fort's battlements (because neither of them could swim) and this forced Jack to dive into the ocean to save her.\n\nFollowing the attack on Port Royal by the Black Pearl, both were part of the assembly of officers and marines at the fort who attempted to devise a plan of action against the Pearl. When Will Turner appeared to state the obvious, Norrington ordered Murtogg to escort Turner away. Later on in the discussion, Murtogg suggested that Norrington ask the recently-incarcerated Jack Sparrow about the Black Pearl, but the Commodore rejected the idea. Will Turner, however, took this advice, and consequently set out on a quest to track down the Pearl with Jack.\n\nThe Royal Navy ultimately set up a search for Elizabeth, who had been captured during the attack, and Murtogg and Mullroy were stationed aboard the HMS Dauntless. They participated in the fight against Hector Barbossa's undead pirates aboard the vessel, sharing a brotherly handshake before charging into battle, and survived the conflict.\n\nDuring the War of Jolly Roger, when the Black Pearl was captured by the Navy and moved to Black Pearl Island, both Murtogg and Mullroy were assigned to guard the ship. However, they were unsuccessful because the ship was stolen right under their nose by a group of pirates. The pair were later assigned to guard Port Royal prison. While there, they were able to thwart an escape attempted by Ragetti and Pintel.\n\nAround the time the Flying Dutchman was commanded by the newly-promoted Admiral James Norrington, Mullroy and Murtogg served the East India Trading Company. When they first saw the Dutchman's crewmen, both soldiers was frightened by their appearances, although they were ordered by Admiral Norrington to stay steady. They were tasked with guarding the Dead Man's Chest, training cannons on it to prevent Davy Jones from regaining control of his ship. The chest was ultimately stolen by Jack Sparrow while Mullroy argued the representation of the \"fish people\" with Murtogg. They later joined the battle around Calypso's maelstrom, eventually switching sides with the death of Lord Cutler Beckett, adopting piratical outfits and joining in with the celebrations aboard the Black Pearl. They were the only known survivors of Beckett's forces on the Dutchman, having swung across to the Black Pearl and then apparently abandoning fighting.\n\nAfterwards, the two put on pirate attire and joined in celebrating the death of Lord Cutler Beckett. Though Ragetti and Pintel noticed them, the two didn't seem to care and didn't harm them. They remained aboard as crew members during and following Barbossa's second mutiny, though joined Pintel and Ragetti in confronting Barbossa over this course of action. Nevertheless, they appeared set to remain aboard.\n\nIt is unknown if Mullroy and Murtogg participated in the battle in which the infamous pirate Blackbeard captured the Black Pearl.

While working for England, he attacked Spanish possessions including Venezuela and Panama. Among his accomplishments were helping write the Code of the Pirate Brethren with \"Bartholomew\" at the dawn of the Golden Age of Piracy, becoming a knight of England, and being appointed lieutenant governor of Jamaica. During the late 1680s, through unknown circumstances, he retreated to a secret hideout where he began to study alchemy, eventually discovering the secret of immortality and becoming known as the Shadow Lord.

Treachery was also among his many and habitual transgressions. Despite this, those who remembered Morgan thought he was an \"incompetent buffoon\", saying he was a terrible pirate and that he could barely stand upright on a ship.

His Shadow Army was an unstoppable force which no human power or army could match. He could also speak through enchanted mirrors to people far away from him."],"name":"Henry Morgan","description":"Henry Morgan was born in 1635 to a prosperous Welsh farming family, but he chose life at sea while a young man. After starting as a buccaneer on Tortuga and later in Barbados, he settled around 1660 in Port Royal on England's newly acquired island of Jamaica. He was soon joined by his uncle, Edward Morgan, who was appointed lieutenant-governor of the island after the restoration of King Charles II in 1660. After marrying his uncle's eldest daughter, Mary Elizabeth, later that year, Henry Morgan began sailing in the buccaneer fleets that were employed by the English to attack Spanish settlements. In this new role, he served a captain in the fleet of Admiral Christopher Myngs in 1662-1663.\n\nHaving taken part in Myng's successful plundering of Santiago de Cuba and Campeche, Mexico, Morgan returned to sea in late 1663. Sailing with Captain Jack Morris and three other ships, Morgan looted the provincial capital of Villahermosa. Returning from their raid, they found that their ships had been captured by Spanish patrols. Unperturbed they captured two Spanish ships and continued their cruise, sacking Trujillo and Granada before returning to Port Royal, Jamaica. In late 1665, Morgan commanded a ship in Edward Mansfield's expedition against Providence and Santa Catalina.\n\nSent by Jamaican Governor Thomas Modyford, the expedition captured the islands, but encountered problems when Mansfield was captured and killed by the Spanish. With their leader dead, the buccaneers elected Morgan their admiral. With this success, Modyford began sponsoring a number of Morgan's cruises again the Spanish. In 1667, Modyford dispatched Morgan with ten ships and 500 men to free a number of English prisoners being held in Puerto Principe, Cuba. Landing, his men sacked the city and freed the prisoners before re-embarking and sailing south to Panama.\n\nComing ashore near Puerto Bello, Morgan and his men overwhelmed the garrison and occupied the town. After defeating a Spanish counterattack, he agreed to leave the town after receiving a large ransom. Though he had exceeded his commission, Morgan returned a hero and his exploits were glossed over by Modyford and the Admiralty. Sailing again in January 1669, Morgan descended on the Spanish Main with 900 men with the goal of attacking Cartagena. Later that month, his flagship, Oxford exploded, killing 300 men. With his forces reduced, Morgan felt he lacked the men to take Cartagena and turned east.\n\nAttacking Maracaibo, Venezuela, Morgan plundered the town before sailing south into Lake Maracaibo and occupying Gibraltar. After several weeks ashore, Morgan sailed north, capturing three Spanish ships before re-entering the Caribbean. As in the past, he was chastised by Modyford upon his return, but not punished. Having established himself as the preeminent buccaneer leader in the Caribbean, Morgan was named commander-in-chief of all warships in Jamaica and given a blanket commission by Modyford to make war against the Spanish.\n\nMorgan's popularity among the buccaneers was so big, that he became a Pirate Lord of the Brethren Court. He attended the Second Brethren Court where, together with the fellow Pirate Lord Bartholomew, he wrote the Code of the Pirate Brethren. Morgan solidified the Brethren Court, brought order among the buccaneers, and strengthened piracy in the Caribbean.\n\nSailing south in late 1670, Morgan recaptured the island of Santa Catalina on December 15 and twelve days later occupied Chagres Castle in Panama. Advancing up the Chagres River with 1,000 men, he approached the city of Panama on January 18, 1671. Splitting his men into two groups, he ordered one to march through nearby woods to flank the Spanish as the other advanced across open ground. As the 1,500 defenders attacked Morgan's exposed lines, the forces in the woods attacked routing the Spanish. Moving into the city, Morgan captured over 400,000 pieces of eight.\n\nDuring Morgan's stay, the city was burned however the source of the fire is disputed. Returning to Chagres, Morgan was stunned to learn that peace had been declared between England and Spain. Upon reaching Jamaica, he found that Modyford had been recalled and that orders had been issued for his arrest. On August 4, 1672, Morgan was taken into custody and transported to England. At his trial he was able to prove that he had no knowledge of the treaty and was acquitted. In 1674, Morgan was knighted by King Charles IIand sent back to Jamaica as lieutenant governor.\n\nArriving in Jamaica, Morgan took up his post under Governor Lord Vaughan. Overseeing the island's defenses, Morgan also further developed his vast sugar plantations. In 1681, Morgan was replaced by his political rival, Sir Thomas Lynch, after falling out of favor with the king. Removed from the Jamaican Council by Lynch in 1683, Morgan was reinstated five years later after his friend Christopher Monck became governor.\n\nAccording to various legends and lore, Morgan died in Port Royal on August 25, 1688. The official diagnosis was dropsy, but it was believed that he might have contracted tuberculosis while in England or had liver failure due to heavy drinking.\n\nHowever, Henry Morgan's death was only a legend. Through unknown circumstances, he moved to the secret laboratory on a remote island where he began to study alchemy. Morgan spent years studying all sorts of science, sorcery, and black magic. He also discovered a way to live forever, and was able to prolong his life. By the 1710s, he was known as the Shadow Lord, a master of alchemy. With his power, he created the Shadow Army, an army of inanimate objects brought to life by magic.\n\nFor their first mission, the Shadow Army was sent against Panama. The town was mercilessly destroyed, though the Shadow Lord's ship was destroyed in the process. Despite this small problem, the Shadow Lord knew he needed more practice before he'd be ready for his day of vengeance. Remembering the injustice done to him long ago, the Shadow Lord was bent on having his revenge on the Pirate Lords on the Day of the Shadow. However, the Shadow Gold, a magical elixir and the source of his power, was stolen from him. So now he had to find it, but not before getting a new ship.\n\nDisguised as an ordinary pirate, Morgan went to Tortuga, intending to join the crew of Jack Sparrow. He found Jack inside the Faithful Bride tavern, and, after introducing himself as Henry, they shook hands, and Morgan used the opportunity to curse Jack with the Shadow Sickness. However, before he could join Sparrow's crew, he was recruited by Eduardo Villanueva, the Spanish Pirate Lord of the Adriatic Sea.\n\nMorgan boarded Villanueva's ship, the Centurion, which sailed for Europe. At some point during the journey, Morgan revealed his powers, captured the whole crew, and took control of the ship. With Morgan at the helm, the Centurion docked in Marseilles. Once on the land, Morgan found a sailor and forced him to tell him where he could find the French Pirate Lord Chevalle.\n\nShortly after ariving to France, Morgan used his powers to contact Benedict and Barbara Huntington, the officials of the East India Trading Company from Hong Kong. They were in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean aboard the HMS Peacock, sailing for Europe. Morgan spoke to them through Barbara's enchanted mirror and promised them that despite their recent failures in preventing Jack Sparrow from reaching the African Pirate Lord, they'll have the chance to kill him in Europe.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Henry_Morgan"}}

Later, he became part of the troops located in Port Royal, which were in command of James Norrington when he was promoted Captain.\n\nLieutenant Gillette was present at Commodore James Norrington's promotion ceremony at Fort Charles. When Elizabeth Swann fell off of Fort Charles, the Lieutenant prevented Norrington from jumping to save her, stating that the rocks could lead to his death. Gillette, along with a group of Royal Marines, followed James to the harbor, where they cornered Jack Sparrow, who had saved Elizabeth. At Norrington's orders, Gillette brought a pair of hand cuffs and placed them on Sparrow's hands. The pirate, however, managed to escape. Gillette joined in the search for Jack Sparrow.\n\nAfter the Black Pearl attacked Port Royal, Gillette and his men were stationed aboard HMS Dauntless, and were forced to concede control of the vessel over to Sparrow and his accomplice, William Turner, during their attempt to reach Tortuga.\n\nGillette, who ended up in a longboat, warned Norrington of the situation, but Jack and Will duped them all by commandeering the HMS Interceptor and leaving the HMS Dauntless dead in the water. With the rudder chain disabled, the vessel was unable to turn. In the longboat, Gillette became aware of a large shadow looming over them, which turned out to be the Dauntless'  massive bow. Realizing that they were about to collide with the significantly bigger ship, Gillette gave the order to abandon ship before impact, though the longboat was crushed under the Dauntless'  hull. The Lieutenant escaped, and returned to Port Royal to assist in the search for Elizabeth Swann, who was kidnapped the night before.\n\nAfter Commodore Norrington rescued Elizabeth Swann from Black Sam's Spit, along with Jack Sparrow, the HMS Dauntless made its way to Isla de Muerta to save Will Turner. When they arrived, under the suggestion of Jack Sparrow, Norrington ordered that Elizabeth to be locked in the captain's cabin of the Dauntless for her safety. Elizabeth tried to tell Gillette to warn Norrington about undead pirates, but Gillette dismissed her warning.\n\nLater, Hector Barbossa's cursed pirates appeared on deck to kill them off. He participated in the fight against the cursed pirates aboard the Dauntless.\n\nBefore the battle, he was alerted by a sailor about a boat containing two strange figures. They turned out to be the cursed pirates mentioned by Elizabeth. Pintel, one of the pirates, attempted to shoot Gillette but missed. Instead, the shot caused the Lieutenant's hat to fly straight into the path of Barbossa's invading crew, ultimately giving away their element of surprise. Gillette quickly drew his pistol and fired at one of the pirates before drawing his sword to join in the heated battle.\n\nThe crew of the Dauntless fought valiantly against Barbossa's crewmen, though their numbers were depleting as the immortal pirate crew killed many soldiers. Once Norrington and his soldiers returned to help those aboard the Dauntless, the battle turned in Gillette's favor. At some point during the fight, Gillette attempted to swing a pulley at a cursed Bo'sun but the pirate managed to dodge it.\n\nInstead of hitting it's intended target, the pulley smashed Ragetti at the back of his head, knocking his wooden eye ball out.\n\nGillette survived the battle, and was present at Jack Sparrow's execution at Port Royal. However, seconds before being hung, Sparrow managed to escape with the aid of Will Turner. As Jack bade his farewell, he fell off of the edge of Fort Charles, which Gillette commented that he had no where to go but back to the noose. He spoke too soon when the Black Pearl arrived, in which Jack swam towards freedom.\n\nAfter Sparrow's escape, Gillette looked to the Commodore for orders to begin pursuit, but Norrington held off the chase for a day\u2014to give him a head start.\n\nSeveral years after the battle of the Isla de Muerta, Lieutenant Gillette was transferred to London, where he would work closer with His Majesty King George II. He would be stationed aboard the HMS Providence, the pride of the King's fleet. Gillette would serve under the command of Hector Barbossa, former pirate captain of the Black Pearl who had become a privateer and trusted advisor of King George's Court. After Jack Sparrow escaped from St. James's Palace, the Providence was sent sent to find the legendary Fountain of Youth before the Spanish. Gillette was present when Barbossa interrogated Jack Sparrow's comrade, Joshamee Gibbs. When the pirate refused to cooperate, Gillette and Theodore Groves tied a noose to prepare Gibbs' hanging. Gibbs then revealed to be in possession of a map to the Fountain of Youth. Before any exchange could be made, Gibbs burned the map, ultimately forcing Barbossa to bring him aboard the Providence as Gibbs memorized every route in the map that led to the Fountain. And so Gillette accompanied Barbossa's crew aboard the Providence at dawn.\n\nA few days into the voyage, Gillette stood by Barbossa when he had Gibbs brought to the helm so he could provide a heading. Gibbs told Barbossa that they were going in the right direction, as he saw three Spanish galleons, commanded by The Spaniard. Barbossa, Gillette and Groves ordered the crew to their battle stations. Though the crew of the Providence prepared for battle, the Spanish ships simply passed without opening fire. Knowing that they've fallen behind, Barbossa ordered the crew to make more sail with Gillette stood by at the helm.\n\nWhen rumors of their destination struck fear into the crew, Barbossa revealed that they were heading for Whitecap Bay, home to deadly mermaids. After the crew were immediately stroked with fear, Gillette watched as Barbossa was ultimately able to inspire confidence into the crew and ordered full sail to Whitecap Bay.\n\nAfter the Providence arrived to the Bay, Gillette went to shore with Barbossa, Groves, Gibbs, and a handful of the crew. They found remains of what had happened on the previous night on Whitecap Bay. The mermaids, angered by last night's battle with Blackbeard's crewmen, attacked the Providence. Barbossa, unconcerned for the lives of his crew, asked Gibbs for a heading. Just as he did so, the mermaids killed all who remained aboard the Providence by flipping the ship over. Gillette, along with Groves, watched helplessly and in shock as their ship sunk beneath the waters. With nothing to do about the situation, Gibbs found their next heading. Gillette ordered all crewmen who were brought ashore to push on.\n\nThe remainders of the crew later met with Jack Sparrow, who helped them to retrieve the Chalices of Cartagena. He had also assisted in leading them to the Fountain of Youth at the precise moment Blackbeard and his crew did. There, the remaining crew of the Providence and the crew of the Queen Anne's Revenge engaged in a battle at the Fountain.\n\nGillette fought valiantly against the pirates, until he went against one of Blackbeard's zombies, Yeoman. The zombie pirate was able to land a strike on Gillette, causing him to unintentionally stumble into the way of Barbossa's fight against Blackbeard. Gillette was killed by the infamous pirate, who impaled the Lieutenant from behind. Gillette's body fell onto Barbossa, who immediately pushed it aside to resume fighting with Blackbeard.\n\nLater in the battle, The Spaniard and his soldiers arrived to the Fountain, revealing their true intentions of destroying the Fountain, not to use it for gaining eternal life for their King. The Spaniard smashed the Chalices and ordered his men to destroy the Fountain. While the Spaniard confronted Blackbeard during the destruction of the Fountain, Gillette's body was carried away by two British marines.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gillette"}}

Slicing and slashing Liang Dao's men with their steep-tipped fans, Park and Lian's efforts helped Feng's side emerge victorious, and he became the new Pirate Lord of the South China Sea.

Barbara came close to discovering Park's rouse, as she noticed how feminine her, Lian, and Carolina looked under their EITC uniforms, but her concerns were brushed off by her husband, who was fooled into letting the pirates go when Jack feigned having leprosy. Continuing to follow the route drawn for them by Sao Feng, Park and the others were eventually stopped by a gang of Mistress Ching's men, who believed them to be genuine EITC agents.

Once his father was out of the way, George II was coronated as the new King of England and made St. James's Palace his primary residence in London. Once taking the throne, King George II would rule throughout the 18th century, where he lived in his grand and elegant residence with his royal guards and many loyal subjects and advisors. He would spend most of his time in the dining room, meeting guests of honor or eating from the royal banqueting table. One of the entrances also served as an enormous mural featuring King George II himself.\n\nIn the 1730s, the King appointed his good friend Weatherby Swann as the governor of Port Royal, the most important British colony in the central Caribbean. The new governor went to the Caribbean, and discovered that the Caribbean waters are plagued with pirates. Some time after the battle of the Isla de Muerta, the King ordered Captain Oliver Randolph Pynce-Jones III to exterminate all pirates in the Caribbean waters.\n\nShortly before Lord Cutler Beckett arrived to Port Royal, the King provided him with Letters of Marque, which the King himself signed, to offer pirate Jack Sparrow a full pardon and commission him as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. But Beckett's plan was unsuccessful, as former commodore James Norrington was able to turn in the letters signed, as well as presenting the heart of Davy Jones to Beckett.\n\nAfter Beckett captured Davy Jones' heart, thereby gaining control of the Flying Dutchman, the King made Beckett his representative. This gave Beckett a deal of great power and command over the armada, which included many soldiers and vessels of the Royal Navy, which he assembled in his attempt to rid the world of the Brethren Court and all other pirates on the Seven Seas. However, Beckett's plans would once again fail as the Flying Dutchman would change sides after the death of Davy Jones. This resulted in the deaths of Beckett and the majority of the Endeavour's crew, which then resulted in the armada's retreat. The only known surviving crew member of the Endeavour was Lieutenant Theodore Groves, who would return to England.\n\nOn 1750, the 23rd year of his reign, King George II would receive a report that King Ferdinand of Spain had located the Fountain of Youth. The King wanted the legendary spring found before the Spanish, as he didn't want a Catholic to gain eternal life. At some point prior to this, the British would have already employed Hector Barbossa, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea, as a privateer, where he would later have gained King George's trust and became a loyal servant. Barbossa would be given captaincy over the HMS Providence, in which he would lead the search for the Fountain. But first, King George needed someone to guide an expedition.\n\nSoon King George would have learned from his ministers that Jack Sparrow was recruiting a crew to undertake a voyage to the Fountain of Youth. Usually, the King and his policy makers would not strike a deal with a common pirate like Jack, but these were exceptional times. And so, after Jack Sparrow was arrested outside of St. James's Palace, the King's Royal Guards literally dragged the pirate into the palace where he would meet with King George himself in the dining room. Followed by his loyal subjects, particularly Lord John Carteret and Prime Minister Henry Pelham, King George heaved his bulk into his personal throne on the other side of the table, opposite of Jack.\n\nThe meeting began with much confusion on if Jack Sparrow was the \"real\" Jack Sparrow. And Jack couldn't recognize King George by face nor name, even after Pelham gave Jack an introduction. After Jack made too much rattling with his chains within the room, an annoyed King George ordered Jack's chains to be removed. The King and his advisors then asked Jack if he had a map and if he could guide an expedition to the Fountain. Although Jack realized his map was gone, he revealed that he knew the way to the Fountain well enough if they were to provide a ship and crew. The King then had Jack introduced to the peg-legged captain of the expedition: his old nemesis, Hector Barbossa. Jack and Barbossa had a brief reunion until Jack angrily reacted to Barbossa's brief telling of having lost his beloved Pearl, in which he was restrained by two guards. King George then resumed the matter of Barbossa completing his mission before the Spanish succeeded.\n\nIt was at that moment that Jack Sparrow made one of his legendary escapes while surrounded by royal guards and a room full of shocked advisors. The King was pulled back as Jack ran across the banqueting table. Jack would eventually grab onto the chandelier and swing across the room, in which the King, Barbossa, and the King's advisors stared at the seemingly impossible escape. Jack made it to the balcony, and grabbed the creme puff that was stuck on the chandelier and ate it as he left. While the Royal Guards went after Jack, King George reacted to the pirate's escape, but Barbossa assured him that he'd have it taken care of. However, Jack Sparrow would have ultimately escaped the King's guards.\n\nWith the pressing issue of the Spanish outdistancing them towards the Fountain, the King sent Barbossa to find the Fountain aboard the Providence, where he was joined by the best-drilled crew that the finest officers of the Admiralty could produce. But King George didn't realize the Spanish's true intentions with the Fountain. In the end, the Spanish were successful in their mission to destroy the Fountain of Youth. The British, however, while inspired by being \"King's men\", either died or deserted by the end of the quest, with Barbossa himself returning to piracy.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/George_II_of_Great_Britain"}}

Mockingly named after Captain Jack Sparrow, this capuchin monkey was considered the meanest, most rotten-tempered simian in all the Caribbean. Jack the Monkey first joined his owner in a search to find of the cursed treasure of Cortés, which Jack lived under throughout his life as an undead monkey."],"name":"Jack (monkey)","description":"Jack became cursed along with the rest of the crew of the Black Pearl, and helped Hector Barbossa's men track down all 882 coins that would free them from the curse. Jack stole the final piece of treasure from Will Turner aboard the Interceptor and returned it to Barbossa. He was present at Barbossa's death on Isla de Muerta, and was, at this point, free of the curse, after being swatted away by Elizabeth, no longer afraid of Jack. However, Jack deliberately stole a coin from the treasure chest, thus ensuring he became cursed once more.\n\nAfter this, Jack found his way back onboard the Black Pearl when it returned to Isla de Muerta to find the island had been claimed by the sea. Jack remained onboard the Pearl, now under Jack Sparrow's command, and attempted to steal a drawing of the key to the Dead Man's Chest held by Sparrow. The pirate captain shot Jack, though the undead monkey escaped unscathed, but lost the drawing in the process.\n\nLater, when the ship was run aground on an island inhabited by cannibals, the monkey stole Ragetti's wooden eye when he and Pintel found the ship. Later, Sparrow's crew managed to capture the monkey, and Sparrow used him to barter with Tia Dalma for information on the whereabouts of the Dead Man's Chest. Jack remained in the vicinity of Dalma's shack, perhaps due to the presence of his former master returned from Purgatory. Later, after Jack Sparrow's death, Tia finally introduced the reborn Barbossa to Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Joshamee Gibbs, Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton and Marty. At that moment, Jack returned to his rightful place on his master's shoulder.\n\nJack accompanied his master on the quest to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. The monkey admitted, with a raised hand, that he had missed Sparrow after returning from World's End, which caused Sparrow to agree to let him come with him. The monkey was also one of the only ones who came after Jack because he actually missed him. He also developed something of a partnership with Cotton's parrot; the two worked together during the battle in Singapore to destroy a fireworks factory. However, during an altercation aboard the Black Pearl, Jack drew a small pistol on the parrot just as Barbossa did the same to Sparrow.\n\nJack later retrieved Jack Sparrow's piece of eight and gave it to his master after a parley with Cutler Beckett. Jack remained aboard the Black Pearl, during the battle around Calypso's maelstrom, where he witnessed the impromptu marriage of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, with Pintel and Ragetti. After Will swung over to the Flying Dutchman, Jack joined them when Pintel and Ragetti fired him from a cannon. Jack, still immortal but none too pleased with this undignified mode of transport, flew into Maccus's face and attacked him, knocking him to the deck, rescuing Will, who was in trouble at that point.\n\nThe monkey escaped the Dutchman by clinging to Jack Sparrow's makeshift parasail, and returned to Barbossa on the Pearl. He was with his master when the Pearl and the Dutchman destroyed the HMS Endeavour, and he was with him when the pirates expressed their victory. After the battle, Barbossa commandeered the Black Pearl from Jack, again, at Tortuga. Barbossa happily fed Jack a peanut while onboard while sailing out to open sea.\n\nAt some point after departing from Tortuga, the Black Pearl was attacked by the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship of the notorious pirate Blackbeard. Using his sword, Blackbeard brought the rigging of the Pearl to life, and used it against Hector Barbossa and his crew. Barbossa's men were defeated, and Barbossa barely survived. After the attack, Blackbeard shrunk the Pearl and put it into a glass bottle, with Jack and Cotton's Parrot inside of it.\n\nJack Sparrow would later discover the bottle and gain possession of it, thanks to Joshamee Gibbs.\n\nOne year later Jack was restored to his original size along with the Black Pearl by Hector Barbossa. He remained with Barbossa on their travel to the Black rock island where the Trident of Poseidon resided. During the travel, Barbossa gave him Sparrow's former compass to prevent him from stealing it back. When they arrived to the island, Jack stayed on the Pearl.\n\nFollowing the death of Barbossa and the destruction of the Trident of Poseidon, which broke all curses of the sea, Jack mourned Barbossa's demise along with the rest of the Pearl's crew. Having no reason to hold a grudge against him anymore and seeing just how much respect he truly had for Barbossa even when they had not always agreed, Jack finally accepted Sparrow as his captain, returning his compass as a sign of peace and deciding to stay with him, on the top of his shoulder like he used to do with Barbossa, from now on. Sparrow looked surprised and put off at first but quickly changed his expression and accepted him back. Together they sailed towards the horizon.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jack_(monkey)"}}

It was here that young Henry witnessed the green flash as well as meeting his father, Will Turner, for the first time.\n\nWhen he grew older, the young man wanted to reconnect with his father, so he decided to free him from the curse of the Flying Dutchman. He spent several years searching for him, eventually becoming a headstrong young sailor in the British Royal Navy. He served aboard the powerful warship called the Monarch.\n\nThrown into the brig of the Monarch, Henry was unable to participate in battle when the ship was attacked in the haunted waters of the Devil's Triangle. That accidentally led to Henry being the only survivor of the battle, in which the Monarch's crew was massacred by the ghosts led by Captain Armando Salazar. When Salazar walked below deck, he picked up a wanted poster of the infamous pirate Jack Sparrow from the floor and asked Henry if he knew Sparrow. When Henry replied that he knew Sparrow only by name, Salazar walked through the bars and asked the scared Henry to find Sparrow and give him a message about death coming straight for him.\n\nHenry was found by another navy ship and was arrested for treason. He was taken to church in Saint Martin to tend to his wounds but was shackled to the bed where a nun asked him for information about the Trident of Poseidon. Though she disbelieves his story with dealing with the dead, she says he must help her before she frees him and runs after being recognized. Both of them are then chased by British soldiers and make an escape attempt.\n\nHenry sneaks into town where he hides behind a corner and overhears soldiers say they have apprehended Jack Sparrow who they take away to jail.\n\nNow knowing where to find Jack, Henry infiltrates the prison as a guard and starts searching for Sparrow by asking the prisoners where he was. Henry then reached a cell where he was grabbed by the man he was looking for, after brief skepticism that he was the real Jack, Henry revealed to him his identity as Will and Elizabeth's son. Henry stated he needed Jack to help locate the Trident of Poseidon to free his father but Jack was uninterested in his tale even falling asleep in the middle of the story. Henry soon got Jack's attention by asking if he knew Armando Salazar and reveals he was resurrected and to relaying the message about hunting him down and told the now scared Jack that the trident was his only chance to defeat Salazar and his undead horde. He then asked Jack if he will team up with him.\n\nSalazar saw that they were approaching Black rock island and knowing he couldn't tread land abducted Henry, taking him back to his ghost ship. There Turner's body was possessed by Salazar who knew that once he had the Trident of Poseidon he could undo the spell. With Henry's body, Salazar traveled the island where he found the way to reach the Tomb of Poseidon.\n\nThe sea had finally been tamed. All was calm as they sailed back to Henry's home, where he tried to kiss her though she slapped him for it thinking he was still possessed. He forgives her and kisses her, a sentiment she returns.

Salaman and the rest of the crewmen were let down to witness the Cook's punishment.\n\nSalaman joined in on Blackbeard's attempt to capture a mermaid on Whitecap Bay. He led Blackbeard and the other crewmen to the top of the lighthouse, where he would activate the whale oil-fired beacon in order to attract the mermaids. He was able to know that whale oil was used for the lighting. Though he wasn't sure it'd work, Salaman got the bay's lighthouse in working condition. After the mermaid attack that took place, Salaman and a group of pirates believed to have caught a mermaid, only to find Scrum, dazed from the experience with mermaids, in the net. However, the crew was able to capture one mermaid and headed for a protected cove to continue their quest.\n\nSalaman joined the rest of the crew as they continued Blackbeard's search for the Fountain of Youth. He was present in Blackbeard's successful attempt to get a mermaid's tear from the captured mermaid, whom Philip Swift named Syrena. As the crew made their way to the cave entrance to the Fountain of Youth, Salaman breaks a piece of stalactite off, which caused another stalactite to fall onto a pirate near him, killing him instantly. Later, the crew was able to arrive to the Fountain of Youth. However, they were met by Hector Barbossa and his crew, and a battle ensued between the two crews. Salaman fought bravely against the British soldiers, until the Spaniard and his men arrived to destroy the Fountain.\n\nHector Barbossa was able to fatally wound Blackbeard, and then claimed Blackbeard's ship, crew and sword as payment for his missing leg. Salaman and the rest of the surviving members of Blackbeard's crew joined him as they made their way back the Queen Anne's Revenge. He took his place as part of the crew as Barbossa had the Revenge set sail for Tortuga. His further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Salaman"}}

But soon she ran away to sign on board a man-o-war. A few years after Mary jumped a ship, but only to enlist in a foot regiment of the British Army. She fought showing great bravery. Mary later joined a horse regiment where she then fell in love with a soldier. She confessed her womanhood to this man and they were married. The two of them opened up an inn called the Three Horseshoes near the Castle Breda. Mary's husband eventually died, and once more she wore men's clothing, and attempted once more a life in the British Army. She failed at this, so she shipped off to the West Indies.\n\nOn her way, her ship was taken by pirate Captain \"Calico Jack\" Rackham. As fate would have it, another woman pirate, named Anne Bonny, was part of Calico's crew. Anne saw a young strapping sailor among the newly-captured prize and decided that she would have her way with him. To Anne's surprise, when she got the man alone, he opened his blouse and he exposed to Anne that he too was a woman. Then Mary confessed that she would rather join with Rackham and Anne than lead the dull life as a woman and she too became one of Calico's pirates.\n\nRead fell in love with one of the sea artists (carpenter or navigator) who had been forced to join Rackham's crew. He was due to fight a duel with an experienced pirate he had rubbed the wrong way. Read, knowing that her beloved stood no chance against him, started a quarrel with the older man and challenged him to a duel that would take place before the pending duel with the artist.\n\nDuring the subsequent duel the older man stumbled during a thrust. Legend has it that Read ripped her shirt open, revealing her gender. Supposedly, in the moment of the pirate's surprise and hesitation, she quickly grabbed his cutlass and killed him.\n\nIn October 1720, the troops of pirate hunter Captain Jonathan Barnet took them by surprise, and captured Rackham, his sloop William and his crew on behalf of the governor of Jamaica. Rackham and the majority of his crew were reportedly drunk, and did not put up much resistance, many being passed out in the ship's hold. Read and Bonny did resist, but were outgunned.\n\nRackham and his crew were sentenced to hang for acts of piracy, as were Read and Bonny. However, the females escaped the noose when they revealed they were both \"quick with child\" (known as \"Pleading the belly\"), so they received a temporary stay of execution. Read was believed to have been pregnant by the artist, whom she considered her legal husband before God. Bonny was believed to have been pregnant by Rackham (who was most definitely not her husband).\n\nRead died in prison in April 1721, but there is no record of burial of her baby. Official documents state that Read died of fever associated with childbirth.\n\nAfter her death, her soul was imprisoned in the Buccaneer's Heart until freed by Will Turner.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mary_Read"}}

It was only after the latter skirmish when Groves perished, shot down by The Spaniard."],"name":"Theodore Groves","description":"Not much is known of Theodore Groves' life, but it is known that he became part of the British Royal Navy at a young age. By the 1740s, Groves was a Royal Navy officer, serving as one of the many Navy men stationed in Port Royal, the British colony in the Caribbean. Officer Groves would have served under James Norrington.\n\nGroves continued serving in the British Royal Navy even after James Norrington was promoted to the rank of commodore. Later, the Royal Navy suffered an attack from the Black Pearl, which carried a band of pirates led by Hector Barbossa. It was during this attack that Governor Weatherby Swann's daughter Elizabeth Swann, who was kidnapped by the pirates. On the day of Norrington's search for Elizabeth, Officer Groves assisted Commodore James Norrington's men in prepping the HMS Interceptor for the voyage. As Groves alerted Norrington to Lieutenant Gillette's predicament of being put aboard a longboat, the notorious pirate Captain Jack Sparrow attempted to commandeer the HMS Dauntless from the Port Royal harbor with the help of the young blacksmith named Will Turner. Groves accompanied Commodore Norrington and his marines as they sailed the Interceptor toward the Dauntless to board her.\n\nHowever, once they came aboard, Norrington and his men were left only to watch on helplessly as Sparrow and Turner jump ship and fled aboard the Interceptor. Norrington and Groves ordered the crew to ready the cannons to fire at the Interceptor, though Groves didn't see reason to fire on their own ship. Before Norrington's men could fire the cannons, the steersman alerted to Norrington that Jack Sparrow disabled the rudder chain, thereby making the Dauntless unmovable. This daring maneuver impressed Groves, who voiced his admiration of Jack Sparrow, to a point of stating that he was the best pirate he'd ever seen. Commodore Norrington, however, did not share the sentiment, given the evidence and his experience with Sparrow.\n\nGroves participated in the search for Elizabeth, under the command of Norrington. Later, he fought against Barbossa's undead pirates aboard the Dauntless at Isla de Muerta. He survived the battle, and remained in service as an loyal officer of the Royal Navy.\n\nMonths after James Norrington resigned his commission in the Royal Navy, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company arrived to the Caribbean and took control of the town of Port Royal. At some point during Beckett's control, Groves switched allegiances to serve as an officer of the Company, in which Groves was promoted as one of Beckett's lieutenants. After Beckett gained control of Davy Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman, Lieutenant Groves would be stationed aboard Beckett's flagship, the HMS Endeavour, around the time a venture to rescue Jack Sparrow in Davy Jones' Locker was underway. With the help of Sao Feng's crew of the Empress, Beckett's crew of the Endeavour was able to capture the Black Pearl, until Feng was betrayed by Beckett and switched sides again. Groves once again commented on Jack Sparrow's skill and good fortune, after the pirate escaped the Endeavour to rejoin his crew and, at the exact same time, damaged the Endeavour to the point where Beckett's men wouldn't be able to pursue.\n\nAs Beckett rallied an armada to fight the Brethren Court with, Groves remained onboard the Endeavour as Beckett's second-in-command lieutenant. Groves remained with Beckett when the armada found Shipwreck Cove and during the battle between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman around Calypso's maelstrom. After the Pearl emerged victorious, Groves looked at the ship with his spyglass, wondering what the pirates were waiting for before Beckett had the Endeavour prepare for attack. However, until the Dutchman reappeared and, joining with the Pearl, turned to attack the Endeavour at a full broadside. Standing next to Beckett, Groves stared out and saw their doom before nervously asking Beckett for orders. When Lord Beckett failed to respond to the attack from the Pearl and the Dutchman, Groves gave the order to abandon ship. Unlike Beckett, Groves and the other crewmen raced for the rail of the Endeavour before its destruction.\n\nAfter the defeat of Beckett's Armada, Theodore Groves went to London, where he would work closer with His Majesty King George II as he returned to a life in the British Royal Navy. At some point in the next few years, Groves was promoted to lieutenant commander and stationed aboard the HMS Providence, the pride of the King's fleet. Groves would serve under the command of Hector Barbossa, former pirate captain of the Black Pearl who had become a privateer and trusted advisor of King George's Court. After Jack Sparrow escaped from St. James's Palace, the Providence was sent sent to find the legendary Fountain of Youth before the Spanish. Groves was present when Barbossa interrogated Jack Sparrow's comrade, Joshamee Gibbs. When the pirate refused to cooperate, Groves and Gillette tied a noose to prepare Gibbs' hanging. Gibbs then revealed to be in possession of a map to the Fountain of Youth. Before any exchange could be made, Gibbs burned the map, ultimately forcing Barbossa to bring him aboard the Providence as Gibbs memorized every route in the map that led to the Fountain. And so Groves accompanied Barbossa's crew aboard the Providence at dawn.\n\nSeveral days into the voyage, Groves had Gibbs brought to the helm, by Barbossa's orders, so he could provide a heading. Gibbs told Barbossa that they were going in the right direction, as he saw three Spanish galleons, commanded by The Spaniard. Barbossa, Groves and Gillette ordered the crew to their battle stations. Groves asked Barbossa for orders as the ships came closer. Though the crew of the Providence prepared for battle, the Spanish ships simply passed without opening fire. Knowing that they've fallen behind, Barbossa and Groves ordered the crew to make more sail.\n\nLater, as the crew of the Providence became wary of their destination, it was Groves who confronted Barbossa about the rumors. The privateer revealed that they were heading for Whitecap Bay, home to deadly mermaids. As the crew were immediately stroked with fear, Groves attempted to calm the men down, though one of the crewmen raced for the railing and jumped overboard. Barbossa was ultimately able to inspire confidence into the other crewmen and ordered full sail to Whitecap Bay. After the Providence arrived to the Bay, Groves went to shore with Barbossa, Gillette, Gibbs, and a handful of the crew.\n\nWhile ashore, they examined the aftermath of a skirmish that had recently occurred, particularly a deceased mermaid. Groves suggested to Barbossa that they must move hastily before being interrupted by the sounds of an assault on the Providence by the feared creatures. Groves, driven to action by the distant battle, urged Barbossa to return to the ship and aid the men under his command. The privateer, however, pulled his pistol and nonchalantly asked Groves again what he believed he was hearing. Groves begrudgingly accepted Barbossa's instructions and took notice along with Gibbs when the Providence slipped beneath the stirring sea. With reluctance, Groves and Gibbs led the few remaining crewmen of one of the Royal Navy's best ships on their next heading.\n\nThe Providence crew continued on as they made their way through thick jungle, with Barbossa collecting small poisonous dart frogs along the way. Groves would assist Barbossa in his collecting by carrying the jar full of Barbossa's frog collection. Later, after Barbossa collected one more frog, Barbossa left the crew as he journeyed ahead onto Ponce de León's legendary ship, the Santiago. Later, Barbossa would return from the Santiago with pirate Jack Sparrow, who would join Barbossa's crew in their attempt to infiltrate the Spanish camp and retrieve the two silver Chalices of Cartagena.\n\nBy Barbossa's orders to Groves, the crew had to wait for the signal while he and Jack continued on infiltrating the Spanish camp. Though they were both captured, Jack managed to escape by his own means and slingshotted himself from two palm trees. While Jack was distracting Spanish soldiers, Groves came to Barbossa's aide, believing that Jack's escape was the signal. He freed his captain of his bonds and from the palm tree that he was tied on. Groves, while carrying Jack's effects, then ran with Barbossa to the other crewmen in haste. The crew did manage to accomplish their goal, as Jack was able to steal the Chalices. While Jack rejoined with Blackbeard and his pirate crew, Barbossa and Groves along with the other Providence crewmen followed them from a distance.\n\nWhen the pirates found the Fountain of Youth, the crew made a surprising entrance, with Barbossa proclaiming Blackbeard as his prisoner. But Blackbeard didn't want to go down without a fight, so he and Barbossa ordered both their crews to fight. After a brief interruption from Jack Sparrow, who questioned the crews fighting each other when the quarrel was between Barbossa and Blackbeard, the battle inevitably ensued. Groves fought valiantly against the pirates, but almost all of his fellow crewmen, including Gillette, were soon dead. Later in the battle, The Spaniard and his soldiers suddenly arrived at the Fountain with a large force, outnumbering both the pirates and the British. Trying one last attempt to fulfill the crew's mission, Groves ran up to the Fountain, held the British flag in his hands and proclaimed the Fountain as the property of King George. But at the same moment, The Spaniard shot Groves, instantly killing him.\n\nAfter asking one of his officers to make a note about Groves' bravery, The Spaniard revealed their true intention: rather than use it for gaining eternal life for their King, the Spanish came to destroy the Fountain. The Spaniard smashed the Chalices and ordered his men to destroy the Fountain. While The Spaniard confronted Blackbeard during the destruction of the Fountain, Groves' body was carried away by two British marines.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Theodore_Groves"}}

He was best known for having two female pirates in his crew, Anne Bonny and Mary Read."],"name":"Calico Jack Rackham","description":"John Rackham started his career as quartermaster on the ship of Charles Vane, a pirate who was operating out of New Providence, Bahamas. At the end of 1718, Vane fired on a French vessel that he then discovered was a warship. Although he felt discretion and retreat was the better part of valor, his crew disagreed, and the next day he was sent off after Rackham was elected captain.\n\nRackham spent several months cruising the Caribbean, having as much success in attacking smaller vessels that his little sloop would allow. He earned the nickname Calico Jack, after the colorful calico cotton attire he wore. In December he captured a richly-laden merchant ship (the Kingston) within sight of Port Royal, provoking the merchants there to outfit several privateers to apprehend him. Three months later, they found Rackham at Isla de los Pinos, south of Cuba, still in his ship with the Kingston anchored alongside; Rackham and most of his crew were dozing ashore in a camp of tents made from old sails, and hid in the woods while their ships were captured. In late spring of 1719, Rackham returned to New Providence and received a Royal Pardon from Governor Woodes Rogers.\n\nWhen Rackham began an affair with Anne Bonny, the pardon was soon forgotten. They had a baby that was eventually left in the care of some pirate families in Cuba, and Rackham returned to his former ways, stealing the sloop William and taking Bonny along, dressed as a man.\n\nRackham and Bonny spent over a year attacking small vessels around the West Indies and took on a sailor that would later prove to be a woman named Mary Reade. Rackham at first confronted the 'man' who was spending too much time around Anne, but later relented upon discovering her identity and realizing the benefit of friendship for the pair.\n\nCalico Jack Rackham's run came to an end around October 1720, after Woodes Rogers found out about his return to piracy. A British sloop led by Captain Barnet caught up with him at the west end of Jamaica while the crew was drunk and unable to fight. The women tried to sail the ship away, but it was soon overtaken. Reade, Bonny, and one man were said to be the only fighters, shooting into the hold to try and rouse the others from their hiding spot. Their shots wounded one and killed another.\n\nThe entire crew was soon arrested and taken to Jamaica to be tried for piracy. The proceedings caused quite a stir because of the women pirates, but the women themselves escaped the noose because of pregnancy. The rest of them were hanged on November 27, 1720. Calico Jack's body was gibbeted and hung as a deterrent on Deadman's Cay near Port Royal. At some point after Rackham's death one small island off the coast of Port Royal was named Rackhams Kay.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Calico_Jack_Rackham"}}

The blade was special as, by using the methods of Spanish swordsmiths, Will had made it immensely strong, yet light and flexible. It also had a double edged point for cutting and thrusting. Will proudly engraved his own name on this blade."],"name":"William Turner Jr.","description":"As an infant, Will Turner lived with his parents in North Carolina until his father abandoned him and his mother to join the crew of the Black Pearl. Through unknown circumstances, Will moved with his mother to England where she raised him by herself. Will had believed his father was a merchant seaman, a \"good respectable man who obeyed the law\". When his father sent an Aztec Medallion, Will thought it was just an exotic trinket that his father had picked up on his travels. At some point in his youth, Will's mother died.\n\nAfter his mother died, Will Turner began looking for his father while wearing the gold medallion, soon boarding a British merchant vessel that traveled to the Caribbean Sea. However, Hector Barbossa's cursed crew attacked Will's ship. The only survivor of this pirate attack, Will Turner was spotted, lying unconscious on a piece of driftwood, by young Elizabeth Swann aboard the HMS Dauntless. Pulled from the sea, the Dauntless crew found that he was drifting amidst the murdered crew and burning wreckage of the British ship. Told to care for the half-drowned boy by her father, Governor Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth was left to watch over the unconscious boy as Lieutenant James Norrington's men set about searching the wreckage for more survivors. Will roused in time for he and Elizabeth to introduce themselves before he lapsed back into unconsciousness. Elizabeth then noticed the medallion around Will's neck, though was worried that he was a pirate. Fearing that Norrington would have Will hanged, Elizabeth took the medallion from Will before he was taken below decks. While Will thought the medallion was lost during the rescue, Elizabeth kept the medallion in her possession for the next eight years.\n\nAfter arriving to the town of Port Royal, Governor Weatherby Swann and his daughter Elizabeth moved into a grand mansion while Will was apprenticed to John Brown, a local blacksmith. Swordsmith Will Turner became a simple craftsman. Will became proficient at his trade, and it could be said that he carried out many, if not all, of the duties neglected by his often drunk master. He also began forging a number of swords, and practiced with them for hours at a time at the smithy. He had developed a hatred towards pirates, and wanted to be able to best one in single combat should the opportunity arise.\n\nDuring this time, Will's friendship with Elizabeth developed further, but it grew into something more romantic as they grew older. His life revolved around his work, and his distant longing for a woman he knew could never be his wife. Despite Will's feelings towards the girl, he remained reluctant to reveal his true feelings towards her, likely due to the social divide between them. Even eight years after they met, Will grew to be the man of Elizabeth's dreams. However, he does not dare reveal how he feels, for Elizabeth's father would never let them marry. A governor's daughter was too good for a lowly blacksmith.\n\nEight years after the sailing on the crossing from England, Governor Weatherby Swann requested of Mr. Brown a sword for Captain Norrington, due to be promoted to Commodore. Will forged the sword himself, and delivered it to the Governor's estate. There, he met Elizabeth, but his polite and reserved manner, still present after all these years of friendship, irritated her, and they parted on less than good terms.\n\nWill returned to the blacksmith's following the ceremony, where he was confronted by Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate currently being hunted by Norrington's men. Will's noble nature caused him to engage Sparrow in a duel, during which he displayed his skill with a sword. \"You know what you're doing, I'll give you that,\" quiped Jack as pirate captain and swordsmith are almost equally matched. Will's training gave him an advantage over Jack, who only managed to avoid losing to Will by acrobatic blade work and old-fashioned cheating when he pulled his pistol out. Even now, Will refused to back down, though Jack was reluctant to shoot the boy\u2014and thus waste the single shot contained within his gun, which Jack was saving for Barbossa. His moment of indecision gave Mr. Brown enough time to rise and knock Jack unconscious (with his empty bottle of rum) and reap congratulations for hisefforts from Commodore Norrington, whose stiff manners towards Will (who was socially beneath him) caused him to ignore Will's part in the capture.\n\nJack was imprisoned, and Will continued working at the shop. However, when the Black Pearl launched a surprise attack on the port, he joined the fighting, defeating a number of marauding pirates. However, he was overcome in the battle, and knocked unconscious. Meanwhile, the smoke from the cannon fire grew thicker and thicker as the battle raged on. Down in the cell next to Jack's, a few pests were trying to trade the watchdog a bone for the keys he held in his mouth. Then a cannon ball blew a hole in the prison cell next to Jack's. Jack wached as the punks escaped while he still was trapped behind the filthy bars. When Will awoke, the attack was over, and he soon learned that Elizabeth had been kidnapped by the pirates. Will demanded that Commodore Norrington hunt down the attackers, but with no leads as to the ship's whereabouts, Norrington could do nothing.\n\nWill, however, was not satisfied. He was fiercely loyal to those he cared about, and would not leave Elizabeth in danger. Though it pained him to do so, he made a bargain with Jack Sparrow, freeing him from prison in exchange for information on the Black Pearl. Doing so, he used a trick he knew from being a blacksmith and the same trick was later used by Sparrow to escape the Flying Dutchman's brig. After declaring that he would do anything to save Elizabeth\u2014even die for her\u2014Will accompanied Jack as he commandeered the HMS Interceptor, the only ship that had a chance of catching the Black Pearl. With this, Will committed his first act of piracy, a fact that did not sit well with him. He became further conflicted when Jack revealed that his father, whom Jack had known, had been a pirate and a good man, and it was a pirate's blood that ran in Will's veins.\n\nThe Interceptor made it to Tortuga, where Will was given his first real taste of a pirate's life. He became somewhat overwhelmed by the cut-throats, drunks and bar brawlers that frequented the Faithful Bride, though he remained astute enough to overhear a foreboding discussion between Jack and an old friend, Joshamee Gibbs. As the pirates set out to procure a crew, Will considered the chance that Jack was preparing to betray him, to use him as \"leverage\" with Barbossa.\n\nWill's doubts over the wisdom of continuing with his mission grew when he was presented with Jack's motley crew. He hardly considered them \"able-bodied\", but nevertheless agreed to sail out with them for Isla de Muerta.\n\nAt some point during the journey, the Interceptor encountered the British merchant vessel Earl King, captained by McGlue. Will and Jack disguised as Royal Navy officers and boarded the King, but Captain McGlue realized that they're pirates. The crew of the Interceptor boarded the King, captured the entire crew, and looted the ship.\n\nDuring the voyage, Will learned more about Jack himself; he was once captain of the Black Pearl, but had been betrayed by Barbossa and left for dead. As he and Jack set out alone for the island, Will also discovered the pirates were to keep to the Code, meaning that any man who fell behind would be left behind. Despite Jack's insistence to the contrary, Will kept staunchily to his bleak outlook on pirates.\n\nUpon reaching Barbossa's treasure cave, Will witnessed the supposed sacrifice of Elizabeth, though it transpired that the cursed pirates believed they needed only a drop of her blood, and her life was spared. She was still far from safe, however, so Will took matters into his own hands. Not trusting Jack to help him, Will knocked the pirate unconscious, and rescued Elizabeth from the middle of the pirate assembly. He escaped with her, and the medallion, back to the Interceptor, which promptly left without Jack.\n\nIn the hold of the Interceptor, Elizabeth returned Will's medallion to him, and he realized that it was his blood, not Elizabeth's, the pirates required to lift their curse. Angry and despairing, Will drove Elizabeth away, yet again forestalling the chance of romance between them. Will soon learned that the Black Pearl was in pursuit, though unknown to Will, Jack was on board, and had informed the crew he knew whose blood they needed. After the fight between the Black Pearl and the Interceptor, Will, who was thought to have perished in the destruction of the latter, jumped aboard the Black Pearl. He grabbed a pistol and threatened to shoot himself. Will, despite Jack's protest, identified himself to the perplexed Barbossa as the son of Bootstrap Bill, whose blood was needed to lift the curse. Barbossa agreed that, in exchange for setting Elizabeth free and not harming the crew, Will would surrender to them and not shoot himself.\n\nBarbossa, a man of his word, set Elizabeth free\u2014to be marooned on Rumrunner's Isle with Jack Sparrow. The crew then threw Will to the brig as the Black Pearl sailed to Isla de Muerta to lift the curse. Near the end of the voyage, Will learned what happened to his father through Pintel and Ragetti. As Pintel continued to talk, Will lowered his head. His father was a man who knew right from wrong and who had made these pirates pay; a good man, and a pirate. Will had spent all his life hating pirates, but now everything had changed. Arriving to the island, Barbossa was set to spill all Will's blood, but the unexpected arrival of Jack Sparrow halted Will's sacrifice. He explained to Barbossa that the HMS Dauntless was waiting outside (and discreetly grabbed a piece of the treasure, thus cursing himself), convincing Barbossa to wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment\u2014a phrase Will identified as an indicator that Jack was not siding entirely with the pirates. Trusting Jack, Barbossa sent his crew to attack the Dauntless.\n\nIn the cave, Sparrow suddenly, without any notice, pulled a sword from one of Barbossa's crewmen, threw it to Will, and began dueling with Barbossa while Will began fighting the remaining members of Barbossa's cursed crewmen in the cave. Elizabeth, after escaping from the Dauntless, joined Will and helped him blow up three crewmen. Jack saw that only Barbossa was left, and cut himself, and threw his piece of the gold to Will. Will cut himself and was about to drop both pieces into the chest when Barbossa pulled his pistol and aimed at Elizabeth. Jack pulled his pistol and fired at Barbossa's heart. Barbossa was surprised, but then turned around and saw that the curse had been lifted. Barbossa fell dead.\n\nWhen Will Turner reversed the curse by returning the last Aztec coins to the chest, he technically killed his father because at that moment, somewhere at the bottom of the ocean, Bootstrap Bill became mortal. So Will has been tortured, living with this guilt.\n\nUpon returning to Port Royal, Governor Swann gave Will Turner clemency for his previous actions. Jack Sparrow, on the other hand, was sentenced to hang in Fort Charles. Noticing Cotton's Parrot during the hanging, Will then rushed to save Jack's life, at great risk to his own. After admitting his love to Elizabeth in the presence of Governor Swann and Commodore Norrington, Will disappeared into the crowd before pulling out his sword and headed towards the gallows to save Jack. As the plank fell, he threw his sword into it, creating a plank for Jack to stand on. He pulled out another sword, and began dueling with the executioner, who hit the rope, releasing Jack.\n\nFighting off the Royal Marines, he and Jack ran toward the Fort's edge. They ran and used the rope that Jack had removed from his neck to knock over the Royal marines attacking them. Reaching the Fort's exit, they were surrounded by the Royal Marines attacking them. After both Norrington and Governor Swann confronted Will and Jack, Will revealed that he might be hanged as a pirate himself, though his conscience would be clear. Elizabeth then joined her true love, Will Turner. Seeing these turn of events, Governor Swann order the marines lower their weapons. Jack used this opportunity, and escaped into the sea, where the Pearl waited for him. Norrington realized that Elizabeth loved Will, not him, and conceded. Governor Swann also realized that this was where her heart truly lay. Will and Elizabeth then shared a long, passionate kiss.\n\nFor some time, Will resumed his usual activities, working in John Brown's blacksmith shop, but not for long. Shortly after the Battle of the Isla de Muerta, he and Elizabeth were summoned by Jack to Tortuga. They had a meeting in the Faithful Bride tavern where Jack told about the St. Piran's Blade, a supposedly magical sword which he accidentally sent to the bottom of the sea by sinking the ship which carried it. The meeting was interrupted by Jack's former crew which became undead once again. Will and Elizabeth were captured but Jack managed to escape.\n\nThe cursed pirates forced Will and Elizabeth onto their ship and took them to their secret hideout. They also retrieved the treasure from the ship Jack sank, including the St. Piran's Blade. The cursed pirates waited for the Black Pearl to arrive so they could send her to the bottom of the ocean. But instead, Jack sneaked into the fort and freed Will and Elizabeth. Jack fought against the cursed pirates with St. Piran's Blade, but when Elizabeth took it, the sword started glowing with fire, because she was the only person with the heart pure enough to activate the sword's power. The cursed pirates were easily defeated and their ship was heavily damaged by the cannon fore from the Pearl. After the battle, Will and Elizabeth persuaded Jack to give them the magical blade so they could donate it to some museum.\n\nWhen the infamous undead pirate Jolly Roger attempted to take over the Caribbean, Will sided with the forces that were opposing him. On one occasion, he visited the island of Rambleshack, which was at the time under the attack from Jolly Roger's Army. At the warehouse he met a pirate who escaped from the island's prison just a few moments earlier. After recognizing the pirate as Jack Sparrow's friend, Will gave the pirate a rusty cutlass so the pirate could have at least some protection from Jolly Roger's troops. Later, Will returned to Port Royal, where he met the pirate again, and gave the pirate some fencing lessons.\n\nAbout a year after their declaration of love, Will and Elizabeth were set to be married. During this time, Will had taught Elizabeth how to handle a sword, and continued to work in the smithy. On the day of their wedding, however, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company arrived in Port Royal with warrants for the arrest of Will, Elizabeth and former Commodore, James Norrington. Will was taken captive in the smithy, and brought to the chapel, where Elizabeth waited. With their marriage interrupted, Will could only declare how beautiful his fiancée looked in her wedding dress, while Beckett revealed their arrest\u2014and scheduled execution\u2014was the result of freeing Jack Sparrow the year before.\n\nAlthough Elizabeth remained incarcerated, Will was offered a bargain with Beckett himself: the couple would earn their freedom if Will procured for Beckett Jack's mysterious compass, offering Letters of marque, and the chance to become a privateer, to Jack. Will, left with no other choice, accepted, and bid farewell to Elizabeth, setting out for Tortuga to begin his search for Jack Sparrow.\n\nWill's search for the Black Pearl led him, by way of rumor and supposed sightings, to Isla de Pelegostos. There, he found Jack Sparrow as the chief of the Pelegostos, a cannibalistic tribe that inhabit the island. It wasn't until he was taken as prisoner, along with Joshamee Gibbs and the other crewmen of the Pearl, that he learned that Jack was set to be eaten by the Pelegostos tribe. With Will's help, Jack and the crew of the Pearl escaped, and it was on the Pearl that Will asked Jack for his compass. Jack agreed to give Will the compass, if he helped him find the key to the Dead Man's Chest.\n\nWill, Jack, and the crew traveled upriver, through the Pantano River, to meet with Tia Dalma. She took a particular interest in Will, whose name she had somehow divined, stating that he had a touch of destiny about him. Tia informed Jack that the key would unlock the Dead Man's Chest, containing the heart of Davy Jones.\n\nThe crew set out to find Jones, though Will soon found himself stranded on a wrecked vessel that Jack deviously claimed was Jones' ghost ship, the Flying Dutchman. When the real Dutchman suddenly surfaced from the ocean, Jack attempted to barter Will from Davy Jones to repay his debt, though Jones refused, claiming that one soul was not equal to another. Instead, he press-ganged Will into service. Aboard the Dutchman, Will had a shock encounter with his father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, who had become an indentured sailor on the Dutchman. Will challenged Davy Jones to a game of liar's dice, betting his soul against the key to the Dead Man's Chest. Bootstrap joined in and purposely lost to free Will from an eternity of servitude, at the cost of his own freedom. That night, Will stole the key from Jones himself, and escaped aboard a longboat, though not before vowing to one day free his father. A passing ship, the Edinburgh Trader, rescued him, but Jones summoned the Kraken to destroy it. Will survived and stowed back aboard the Dutchman, now headed for Isla Cruces where the chest containing Jones' heart was buried.\n\nArriving at Isla Cruces, Will was reunited with Elizabeth, along with Jack and James Norrington, already in possession of the chest. Will made to stab the heart\u2014thus killing Davy Jones and setting free his father\u2014though found himself at the point of Jack's sword, and summarily caught in a three-way duel between himself, Jack and Norrington, all intent on claiming the heart (and perhaps Elizabeth's love). Jack managed to unlock the chest and take the heart, though Norrington later stole both it and the Letters of Marque. Will was knocked unconscious by Jack to stop him from stealing the heart for himself, and was rushed aboard the Black Pearl to escape Jones' crewmen.\n\nThe Black Pearl set sail and managed to outrun the Flying Dutchman\u2014a point that did not escape Will's attention\u2014though it was unable to escape the Kraken. Drawing on his previous experience fighting the monster, Will led the crew in temporarily fending the beast off, giving them time to abandon ship. Realizing the Kraken was only after Jack, Elizabeth distracted him with a passionate kiss while chaining him to the mast. Will witnessed the kiss, and believed Elizabeth was in love with Jack. From the longboat, the crew watched on as the Kraken dragged the Pearl and Jack into the sea.\n\nWill, Elizabeth, and the crew sought refuge at Tia Dalma's shack. As they mourned their fallen captain, Will was particularly despondent, although not only over Elizabeth and Jack. Tia understood his despair: with the Black Pearl, Will could have defeated Davy Jones and freed his father. When Gibbs proposed a toast to Jack, Will glumly raised his mug. Will then attempted to discover just how far Elizabeth would go to save Jack, were there a chance to do so. Tia Dalma proved an answer to this apparently hypothetical question, asking if Will, and the crew, would he be willing to travel to World's End to bring back Jack and the Black Pearl. All agreed, including Will. With that, the recently-resurrected Hector Barbossa revealed himself, and the quest began. Will however was only interested in bringing back the Pearl in order to free his father and had no interest in saving Jack.\n\nTurner journeyed to Singapore with the rest of Barbossa's crew, and attempted to steal Sao Feng's navigational charts to avoid a direct confrontation with the Pirate Lord. He was caught in the attempt, though at some point struck a deal with Feng unbeknownst to Turner's companions.\n\nBoth Barbossa and Elizabeth denied they knew Will when he was revealed in Feng's bath house, though Elizabeth inadvertently betrayed him by reacting with horror when Feng made to stab him. Feng's men poised to fight Barbossa's crew when Will pointed out that Steng, believed to be Barbossa's spy, did not belong to either group. at that moment, soldiers from the East India Trading Company, led by Mercer broke into the bath house, forcing Feng, Will and the others to flee. During the fight, Will made good his deal with Sao Feng, obtaining the use of the Hai Peng.\n\nWill sailed with Barbossa and the crew through the frozen ocean. Though throughout the voyage, he communicated little with Elizabeth. The Hai Peng went over the waterfall at World's End, with Will attempting to guide its descent.\n\nSoon after escaping Davy Jones' Locker, Will took part in a tense four-way stand-off between himself, Barbossa, Jack, and Elizabeth, although they had to temporarily put off their disagreements when it was proved that wet gunpowder rendered all their weapons useless. Later, after getting Jack and Barbossa off the Black Pearl, Will let Sao Feng on board the Pearl and was duly named captain, as per their deal.\n\nJack regained command of the Pearl. Will, however, attempted to lead Beckett to Shipwreck Island, leaving a trail of bodies tied to barrels. When Jack discovered this, he made a bargain with Will. When he saw Will in pain over having to choose between his father and Elizabeth, Jack came up with a plan: Jack would kill Jones, thus granting him immortality, and Will got his father's freedom and could still be with Elizabeth. As part of the plan, Jack sent Will overboard, giving him his compass to lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove. Will made it on board the Endeavour, and tricked Beckett into going to Shipwreck Cove.\n\nBefore the climactic battle, Will, Lord Cutler Beckett, and Davy Jones struck parley with Barbossa, Jack, and Elizabeth. At the parley, Will was exchanged for Jack. Later, Will contributed in Calypso's release by supplying the name of the person who betrayed her by telling the First Brethren Court how to bind her: Davy Jones. Shortly, the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman sailed into battle in a massive maelstrom. Will fought alongside Elizabeth on the Black Pearl, and asked her to marry him in the middle of the fight. Elizabeth asked Barbossa to recite the vows, and they were wed while fighting off EITC soldiers and the Dutchman's crewmen.\n\nWill later boarded the Flying Dutchman, where he was attacked by his maddened father, Bootstrap Bill. During the meleé, Will was thrown against a wall. Will soon gained the upper hand and knocked the sword out of Bootstrap's hand and had his sword at his throat. But after seeing Davy Jones preparing to kill Elizabeth, he rushed to her rescue, which resulting in being knocked down. Realizing that Will and Elizabeth love each other, Jones threatened to strike Will.\n\nAt that moment, Jack threatened to strike Jones' heart, shortly after taking it from the chest. Despite Jack's efforts to distract Jones, by threatening to stab his disembodied heart, Will was stabbed in the chest by Jones' sword, one that Will himself had forged. His life faded as his wife held him. Upon seeing this, Bootstrap snapped out of Jones' hold on him and attacked Jones. They struggled but Bootstrap was quickly thrown aside with Jones preparing to strike.\n\nHowever, seeing Will dying, Jack gave up his own dreams of immortality and used the hand of the unconscious Will to impale Jones' heart with his broken sword. This act not only defeated Jones, but gave Will eternal life by making him the new captain of the Flying Dutchman. Will's father cut out his son's heart and placed it in the Dead Man's Chest, before the Dutchman was consumed by the maelstrom.\n\nJack and Elizabeth, on the other hand, escaped the maelstrom through the use of a parasail. As they escaped, they had no choice but to watch the Dutchman going underwater. After Jack and Elizabeth made it back aboard the Pearl, which also escaped the maelstrom, they prepared to attack the HMS Endeavour.\n\nRising from the depths, the Dutchman returned, with Will at its helm, to join the Black Pearl in devastating the Endeavour with cannonfire. Beckett was speechless to know that he lost the war, and the rest of the crew of the Endeavour either abandoned ship or died in the attack. Beckett watched and endured the destruction of his ship and his death. Because of the Dutchman switching sides, the rest of the ships in the armada retreated, and the pirates expressed their victory.\n\nVictory came with great joy for all of the pirates, but for Will and Elizabeth, there came a price. As captain of the Flying Dutchman, Will could only go on land for one day every 10 years. Will had one day with Elizabeth\u2014their honeymoon, during which their marriage was consummated\u2014before leaving to carry out his duty and ferry souls into the afterlife. Prior to leaving, Will gave Elizabeth the Dead Man's Chest, which contained his heart, stating that it had always belong to her and hoped that she would keep it safe. During their one day together, Will and Elizabeth conceived a child, leaving her pregnant. Will departed on the Dutchman, disappearing in the green flash at sunset.\n\nTen years after the Battle of Calypso's maelstrom, after doing the duty to ferry souls to the next world, Will returned to be with his wife and their nine-year-old son.\n\nApproximately two years after their initial meeting - a young Henry Turner, frustrated with his father being cursed to sail the seas but once every ten years - attempted to drown himself with the assumption that his father would attempt to save his life, thus allowing him to meet with him. His theory proved correct - as while submerged in the water, the Flying Dutchman emerged from the sea underneath him, thus saving Henry from death. As he caught his breath, Henry was confronted by his father, angered by his son's recklessness. Henry reiterated what he said to him before, that he would find him - and in response Will revealed his appearance, now covered in barnacles and seaweed in order to scare him away, reiterating that there was no place for him aboard the Dutchman, possibly trying to dissuade him from attempting to join his crew - although Henry was not phased. Will warned him that the ship's crew would quickly realise he was there - cutting the chain attached to his leg while warning him to return to his mother and leave before it was too late, using his sword to cut the rope attached from Henry's leg to the rock he used to sink his body.\n\nHenry refused, telling Will that he would just return to him again even if he threw him off the ship. Angrily reminding Henry of his curse, the young child told his father of an item that could free him - the Trident of Poseidon. Dismissing it as a myth, Will hugged his son but became quickly frustrated when Henry voiced his desire to find Jack Sparrow and find the trident, furiously ordering him to leave the sea and stop acting like a pirate, ironically attempting to protect his son from the very same fate his father before him tried to protect him from. Henry refused, telling Will that he wanted him to come home. Will apologised to Henry as the ship began to sink and told him that his curse would never be broken, giving Henry his necklace before telling him that he must let him go and accept his fate. Using the opportunity to look upon his son, Will expressed his love for him as the ship was once again submerged in water.\n\nNine years later Henry succeeded in destroying the Trident - thus ending all curses in the sea and freeing Will from the curse of the Dutchman. Returning to dry land once more, Will was reunited with Henry who gave him back his necklace. He hugged his son and expressed pride and shock that he was able to break his curse. At that moment, Elizabeth arrived and locked eyes with Will as the two embraced and kissed, now free to live their lives together.\n\nHowever, as they slept that night - they were intruded upon. Thundering footsteps raised noise in the room as the being reached their bed, and Will was quickly awoken by the sight of a menacing crab claw that could only belong to one man. Dismissing it as a bad dream, Will went back to sleep - however the water and barnacles below their bed painted a very real and terrifying truth - that Davy Jones was still alive.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/William_Turner_Jr."}}

A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime, and in 1708 he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover. At the age of 54, after the death of Queen Anne of Great Britain, George ascended the British throne as the first monarch of the House of Hanover. Although over fifty Roman Catholics bore closer blood relationships to Anne, the Act of Settlement 1701 prohibited Catholics from inheriting the British throne. George, however, was Anne's closest living Protestant relative. In reaction, Jacobites attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, but their attempts failed.\n\nDuring his reign as king, George I made St. James's Palace his primary headquarters and residence. His son, George II, was given London's Leicester House as his primary royal London residence by George I himself, and was forbidden from returning to St. James's Palace, due to the many clashes between them.\n\nDuring the Queen Anne's War, George I dispensed many privateers to raid Spanish merchant shipping, but his decision to withdraw all Letters of Marque when the war ended, forced many of them (particularly Edward Teach) to turn to piracy. Though the King's representative Woodes Rogers offered a Pardon to the pirates of Nassau in 1718, many of them continued with their piratical activities in the Caribbean.\n\nDuring George's reign the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of cabinet government led by a prime minister. Towards the end of his reign, actual power was held by Sir Robert Walpole, Britain's first de facto prime minister.\n\nGeorge I died on a trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried. He was succeeded by George II, where he would rule Great Britain with an iron fist from St. James's Palace.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/George_I_of_Great_Britain"}}

He was never known to be wrong in his predictions. The Quartermaster was the one who predicted Blackbeard's death in the hands of a one-legged man. Quartermaster would serve as one of Blackbeard's zombie officers aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, sailing on several voyages. One of which was a raid on an island where a missionary named Philip Swift was captured.\n\nLike the other zombies, Quartermaster still served as Blackbeard's officers by the time Angelica was able to shanghai Jack Sparrow, who was rumored to have been to the Fountain of Youth, aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. The Quartermaster assisted Angelica in Jack's capture by drugging him with a dart in the River Thames. Five days afterwards, as the Queen Anne's Revenge sailed through the ocean, the recently-recruited human crewmen would work with the zombies. Five days afterwards, as the Queen Anne's Revenge sailed through the ocean, the recently-recruited human crewmen would work with the zombies, who used ruthless discipline to force the deckhands into following orders while working aboard the ship. The Quartermaster would have stayed with Angelica as he took the helm, piloting the Revenge.\n\nThat night, the Quartermaster would fight, alongside Angelica and the other zombies, against Jack Sparrow's mutiny on the Queen Anne's Revenge. During the fight between humans and zombies, Quartermaster would fight some of the human crew; one of them having tried to stab him, while Jack Sparrow, after saving Philip Swift from the Revenge's mast, defeated him in combat. Jack kicked the Quartermaster down and ordered his men to tie the zombie down. The Quartermaster, Angelica and the other zombies were soon restrained by Jack's comrades. However, Jack's mutiny failed after Blackbeard himself appeared and used his sword to tangle the mutineers with the rigging of the Queen Anne's Revenge. After unleashing Greek fire upon the Cook, the Quartermaster took Jack to Blackbeard's cabin, where Blackbeard forced Jack to help him find the Fountain of Youth. It was during this meeting that the Cook stood with the Quartermaster, as a newly zombiefied officer.\n\nAfter the Queen Anne's Revenge arrived to Whitecap Bay, the Quartermaster rang the ship's bell, alerting the crew of their arrival. He would have also participated in Blackbeard's mermaid hunt. Shortly after the battle, Blackbeard's crew managed to capture a live mermaid with the help of Philip Swift. The Quartermaster had a net on her as Blackbeard himself looked upon their prize. The zombies would carry their prized mermaid, who Philip Swift would name \"Syrena\", in a glass coffin, half-filled with water, as Blackbeard's crew trekked on an island. While Blackbeard was forcing Jack Sparrow to make the jump over a chasm, Quartermaster was among those who watched as Jack had to pick pistols for Blackbeard to use against Angelica. During this attempt on Angelica's life, Jack asked Quartermaster if he would survive the jump. Throwing the Jack voodoo doll over the chasm, the Quartermaster assured Jack that he would survive. After Jack ultimately made the jump, the Quartermaster had the crew continue on in their quest.\n\nWhile the zombies carried the glass coffin, the coffin itself would break, causing Syrena to transform into a human form. Blackbeard gave Syrena the choice to either walk or die, signaling the Quartermaster to pull out his sword, until Philip offered to carry Syrena through the journey. The crew soon arrived to the Jungle Pools where mermaids were previously harvested of their mermaid tears, which Blackbeard tried to force Syrena to cry. Because Syrena would not yield, Blackbeard was forced to trick Syrena to cry, by having the Quartermaster kill Philip and had his body tossed away. Though in reality, the Quartermaster only sedated him with one of his darts. After Philip's \"resurrection\" and attempt to save Syrena, causing her to shed a tear, the crew successfully retrieved Syrena's tear.\n\nThe next day, the Quartermaster would accompany Blackbeard in meeting with Jack Sparrow, who retrieved the Chalices, and finding the cave entrance to the Fountain of Youth. Holding a torch, Quartermaster led Jack, Angelica, Blackbeard, and the rest of the crew as they climbed down a steep incline to the cavern. Going much deeper inside, the Quartermaster waved his torch across a wall\u2014a dead end. Though this seemed to be the end of their quest, Jack requested for the Chalices, which the Quartermaster reluctantly handed over to him.

Upon learning that Jack Sparrow was recruiting a crew to undertake a voyage to the Fountain of Youth, Prime Minister Henry Pelham was behind the plan to enlist Jack, and knew how to track down the elusive pirate. Usually, the King and his policy makers would not strike a deal with a common pirate like Jack, but these were exceptional times. And so, after Jack Sparrow was arrested outside of St. James's Palace, the King's Royal Guards literally dragged the pirate into the palace where he would meet with King George and his advisors in the dining room. The King would be accompanied by both Prime Minister Henry Pelham and Lord John Carteret.\n\nThe meeting began with much confusion on if Jack Sparrow was the \"real\" Jack Sparrow. And Jack couldn't recognize King George by face nor name, even after Henry Pelham gave Jack an introduction. Getting to the matter at hand, Pelham and the King then asked Jack if he had a map, at which time Jack said he lost it. Pelham and Carteret then asked Jack if he knew the route to the Fountain well enough to guide an expedition, in which Jack inquired if they were to provide a ship and crew. Jack Sparrow was then introduced to the peg-legged captain of the expedition: Hector Barbossa. After Jack and Barbossa had a brief reunion, in which Jack would be restrained by two guards, King George then resumed the matter of Barbossa completing his mission before the Spanish succeeded.\n\nIt was at that moment that Jack Sparrow made one of his legendary escapes while surrounded by royal guards and a room full of shocked advisors. The King was pulled back as Jack ran across the banqueting table. Pelham cowered behind the King's seat while Jack would eventually grab onto the chandelier and swing across the room, in which the King and all of his advisors stared at the seemingly impossible escape. After Jack's escape from the palace and the guards, the King sent Barbossa to continue their mission aboard the HMS Providence, with the pressing issue of the Spanish outdistancing them towards the Fountain. In the end, even though the British didn't realize their true intentions, the Spanish were successful in their mission to destroy the Fountain of Youth.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Henry_Pelham"}}

Hailing from Spain, Salazar was a Spaniard, a high-ranking officer of the Spanish Royal Navy and the decorated capitán of the powerful pirate-hunting warship, the Silent Mary. For many years, Salazar terrorized the seas and killed thousands of pirates until his spectacular fall from grace when a young pirate named Jack Sparrow outsmarted the ruthless pirate killer and led him to his death in the mysterious Devil's Triangle.","Before his death and resurrection, Armando Salazar sailed the high seas for many years and, during that time, earned himself a fearsome reputation. He became a legend in his own right, albeit a terrifying one. Ruthless but noble, he had devoted his military career in the Spanish Navy to eliminating all pirates from the Caribbean. His hatred for pirates was so great that he didn't even consider them men and instead described them as an \"infection\". Salazar was also not a man to show mercy to his enemies even if they did surrender to him, since on one occasion, while casually eating an apple, he ordered the shooting of some surviving pirates with muskets.","Originally an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, Armando Salazar was always dressed in a resplendent white and black uniform adored with three medals on the left side of his coat, proof of his many achievements during his service to his country. His favored weapon was a rapier, a slender, sharply pointed sword which was designed as a thrusting weapon, but he also used it for cutting or slashing attacks when in combat. He was even able to defeat many Marines and Officers of the British Royal Navy without them even putting up a fight. Following his death and resurrection, Salazar's appearance resembled the undead with his uniform darkened and torn and his sword rusty, but his skills remained the same. As a vengeful spirit, he was more dangerous than he ever was as a living man because he gained supernatural abilities such as the ability to walk on water and through solid objects. He also had complete control over his ship, the Silent Mary, which he used to simply slice through other ships. Though the Silent Mary was nothing but a wreck, Salazar's powers made it seemingly indestructible. He also could bring to life the figurehead of his ship to protect him during combat. Combining those powers with his skills, Salazar was literally an unstoppable force to be reckoned with. However, his new powers came with a price. As a ghost, Salazar was unable to walk on dry land, being doomed to spend the rest of eternity on ships or walking on water, without possessing a living human or wielding the legendary Trident of Poseidon."],"name":"Armando Salazar","description":"Not much is known about Salazar's early life except that he joined the Spanish Royal Navy, becoming an officer. He rose through the ranks, earning several high military decorations over the years until he became a capitán in command of the Silent Mary, a powerful ship of the line. At some point during his career, Salazar made a vow to exterminate all the pirates on the high seas, as his father and grandfather had both been murdered by pirates. He became successful and famous. Some of the stories of his pirate hunting expeditions claimed that he had hunted down and killed thousands of pirates mercilessly.\n\nOne day the Silent Mary encountered a pirate fleet of ten ships, the last pirates in the Caribbean who joined forces in an attempt to defeat Salazar. Despite being outnumbered the Spanish attacked the pirates, quickly demonstrating to their opponents that the firepower of the Silent Mary and the skills of her crew were far superior to those of all the ships and crews in the entire pirate fleet. The battle ended disastrously for the pirates with the majority of their fleet destroyed. As the Silent Mary sailed through the burning wrecks Salazar was satisfied with his latest victory over the outlaws that he intended to eliminate. He was standing on the gangway when his second-in-command Lieutenant Lesaro informed him about a few surviving pirates among the wrecks, men who were desperately flying the improvised white flag as a sign of surrender, begging for mercy. Salazar calmly told Lesaro to show them no mercy and the Lieutenant ordered a small squad of soldiers to shoot the survivors.\n\nWhen his men finished their grisly task, Salazar looked at the burning pirate ships and thought that his mission was over as the sea was finally pure again. As his crew celebrated their victory Salazar heard someone calling him from behind. Turning around he took out his spyglass and through the smoke he noticed one more pirate ship, the Wicked Wench, sailing in the opposite direction in an attempt to escape. The young pirate in the crow's nest was shouting to Salazar that he will be spared if he surrendered immediately. The pirate then jumped on deck, provocatively raising the tattered black pirate flag. Not wanting to let a single pirate escape him Salazar ordered his men to change the Silent Mary's course and follow the pirates. The Spanish gave chase and followed the Wench toward a mysterious island shrouded in darkness, in an area called the Devil's Triangle. Believing that the pirates planned to escape through the giant tunnel that seemingly led into the interior of the Triangle, Salazar chose to follow the pirates into the unknown waters. However, as the Wicked Wench approached the entrance the pirates threw ropes around the nearby reefs off the port side of the ship. The loop caught the reef, tightening, and causing the ship to swiftly turn to the left, as the helmsman, the same young man who had mocked Salazar just moments earlier, steered the ship in the same direction, changing the Wench's course at the last moment.\n\nKnowing his men didn't have enough time to make the same maneuver and wanting to avoid collision with the pirate vessel, Salazar took the helm from Lieutenant Lesaro and kept the Silent Mary on her course, sailing straight ahead. As the Spanish sailed past the Wench, Salazar glanced at the young pirate one last time before the Silent Mary entered the Triangle. Sailing through the unknown waters the Silent Mary quickly hit the nearby rocks, severely damaging the bow while knocking the entire crew off their feet. The impact resulted in a massive explosion from the amount of gunpowder in the ship which engulfed the ship in flames, and burnt its entire crew alive. As the fire and the explosions quickly spread from bow to stern, Salazar tried to escape, but the falling yardarm from the mainmast hit him in the head, killing him and knocking him overboard into the sea below.\n\nHowever, even death was not the end of Salazar. As his body began to sink into the depths of the Triangle, the body was suddenly struck by streaks of eerie red light, resurrecting Salazar as the undead by the mysterious supernatural powers of the Triangle, where he was now trapped with his men who were brought back from the dead in a similar fashion. Salazar and his crew of the undead quickly discovered they could not escape from the Triangle, and were forced to spend many years in eternal darkness.\n\nOver the years, Salazar somehow learned that the young pirate who caused his demise was known as Jack the Sparrow, having earned the name \"Sparrow\" with his act of defiance to Salazar's power. He also learned that Sparrow was in possession of an unusual compass, a magical item that could free the Silent Mary and her crew from the Triangle if Sparrow betrayed it by giving it away, as it would release its betrayer's greatest fear, and Salazar was every pirate's greatest fear.\n\nSeveral decades after their imprisonment in the Devil's Triangle, Salazar and his men spotted a Dutch barque flying the pirate flag entering their cave. In a quick battle Salazar and his men slaughtered the pirates and sent their ship to the bottom, leaving only a few debris floating on the surface. A few minutes later, the pirate ship was followed by the Monarch, a British Royal Navy warship. As the Monarch came to a halt, Salazar's men ran across the water, boarded the ship and launched a surprise attack. Due to their ghostly powers, the Spanish easily slaughtered the British and even Salazar joined the fight, killing a few British sailors with his rapier. Finally, he personally confronted the British commanding officer, Captain Toms, who was being held by Salazar's men. When Toms asked him what was he, Salazar grabbed him by the neck, replied \"Death\", broke his neck and threw his corpse into a fire ignited during the attack.\n\nThe battle was effectively over, but a noise coming from below deck caught Salazar's attention. Salazar and a dozen of his men walked below, finding a young sailor Henry and an old pirate locked in the brig. Noticing several wanted posters on the floor, Salazar stabbed one of them with his sword to bring it closer to him, while one of Salazar's men stabbed the pirate through the bars, killing him. Seeing on the poster the face of Jack Sparrow, the man who cost him his life, Salazar asked Henry if he knew the pirate. When Henry replied that he knew Sparrow only by name, Salazar and his men walked through the bars, shocking him. Deciding to leave one man alive to tell the tale of his revenge, Salazar asked Henry to find Sparrow and give him a message about death coming straight for him. Salazar and his crew then returned to their ship, leaving the Monarch behind.\n\nSome time after the battle on the Monarch, Salazar and his men noticed that the giant reefs around the Silent Mary were starting to collapse. Watching the Triangle slowly sinking into the sea, Salazar realised that Jack Sparrow had given away the compass, which was using its powers to free them in retaliation. The dark clouds above the Triangle slowly vanished, allowing Salazar to see the daylight for the first time in decades. Soon, as the last traces of the Triangle sunk beneath the waves, the Silent Mary was surrounded with nothing but the open sea. Even though the ship was now nothing but a wreck, she was magically kept afloat. The Spanish celebrated their liberation, as Salazar stood on the quarterdeck, with his eyes closed and arms spread, enjoying the warmth of the sun. But all that ended in a few moments when he decided to continue his mission and kill all the pirates in the world, starting with Jack Sparrow.\n\nFree from the Triangle, Salazar and his men continued their anti-piracy campaign. Soon they encountered a ship that was flying the red flag of Hector Barbossa, the infamous pirate captain who ruled the seas with the fleet of ten ships. Using their supernatural powers, Salazar and his men used the Silent Mary to simply cut through the pirate vessel, sending her to the bottom of the sea.\n\nOver the next hours, Salazar and his men destroyed several more ships, slaughtering their crews, but leaving one man from each vessel alive to tell the tale of the dead taking command of the sea. During the night they destroyed more ships, leaving nothing except burning wrecks behind. The next morning the Silent Mary encountered the Queen Anne's Revenge, Barbossa's flagship. Lesaro informed Salazar about the pirate ship and Salazar took the helm from him, steering the Silent Mary straight for the pirate ship's bow. As the Silent Mary approached the Revenge, Salazar used his magical powers to bend the bow of his ship backwards, opening the ship's hull like the jaws of a giant beast right in front of the pirate vessel, leaving the pirate crew stunned and unable to react. Just as Salazar intended to crush the pirate vessel, a man on the forecastle shouted his name, telling him that he knew about his search for Jack Sparrow.\n\nSalazar stopped the attack and then leaped on board the Revenge, landing behind Barbossa. As the horrified Captain slowly turned around he stared into the eyes of the sinister pirate hunter. Barbossa regained his courage and told Salazar his name and that he comes before him with cordial intent, where Salazar then laughed and said that every time he tapped his sword, one of Barbossa's men would die. Salazar tapped his sword once and one of Barbossa's crew members was mercilessly killed. With a grin on his face, Salazar ordered Barbossa to speak quicker, before tapping his sword twice on the deck of the ship, leading to the deaths of two more of Barbossa's crew. Salazar then demanded to know where Sparrow was. As Barbossa explained to him that Jack was headed for the Trident, Salazar told him that the sea belonged to the dead and no treasure could save Sparrow from his and his crew's wrath. Barbossa told him that he would find Sparrow for him by sunrise, and if he didn't, he may take his life from him. Salazar agreed to these terms and Barbossa thanked him on behalf of his crew, but Salazar then tapped his sword several more times, before shouting \"You can take what's left of them. The living come aboard!\"\n\nWith Barbossa at the helm the Silent Mary sailed the rest of the day and night searching for pirates. At first-light next day, still without the trace of Sparrow, an impatient Salazar threatened Barbossa with killing him already, but the latter explained to him that the sun had not yet fully risen and the deal was not finished. Annoyed, Salazar told Barbossa his story, his first encounter with Sparrow and his resurrection, giving him an understanding of his reason for wanting to kill Sparrow. Finally, Salazar lost his patience and tried to kill the captain on the spot, but stopped just as Barbossa managed to locate the Dying Gull. Salazar then pursued, forcing Jack along with Turner and astronomer Carina Smyth to be kicked off the ship.\n\nAfter Smyth started to swim to the island of Hangman's Bay, Turner tried to follow her, but Salazar sent three ghost sharks to kill Turner and Sparrow. After waiting a while, Salazar and his crew jumped into the sea and ran on the water, with Salazar nearly killing Jack in his charge but Sparrow used one of the sharks to propel his rowboat, grab Henry (who had already started to swim) and reach the island's beach safe and sound. Salazar confronted his enemy who was terrified at the sight of his undead form but he could not kill Jack because the Spanish captain and his men to their horror saw one of their own dissipating into dust when the retreating waves left him on dry sand. Staying in the shallow water, Salazar promised to wait for Jack to reach the sea again so he could kill him there as the scared Jack ran off.\n\nSalazar returned to the Silent Mary in pure rage and hung Barbossa and his remaining crew upside down and began butchering them all. Barbossa then began to reason with him, saying he would go ashore to fetch him his \"Sparrow\". Salazar then cut the ropes holding Barbossa up and ordered him to go ashore, but this one chose to betray Salazar and escaped along with the others in the Black Pearl.\n\nRealizing that he was betrayed, Salazar chased the pirates once again. The next night Salazar and his crew discovered another ship in pursuit of the Black Pearl, the British warship Essex. Taking the helm of the Mary Salazar steered his ship right into the starboard side of the Essex, crushing the British vessel and killing its commanding officer, Lieutenant Scarfield, and his entire crew in the process. With the Silent Mary sailing alongside the pirate vessel Salazar and his men boarded the Black Pearl, attacking the pirate crew.\n\nAt one point, Salazar and Sparrow became involved in a fight at the cannons of both ships, with Sparrow even being pursued by the figurehead of the Silent Mary which had magically come to life. As Salazar finally found Sparrow below deck of the Silent Mary and prepared to deliver the killing blow, he was interrupted by the appearance of an island right in front of both ships. Jack used this opportunity to escape back on the Black Pearl and many Spanish ghosts retreated to the Mary but Salazar jumped on the Pearl's quarterdeck in a desperate attempt to steer the ship back into the open sea. But it was too late as the Pearl hit the shore, with the bow ending up grounded deeply on land, which killed several of Salazar's men. Before he could suffer the same fate Salazar grabbed Henry Turner and jumped on the Silent Mary's port side quarter galleries. As the sun slowly appeared on the horizon the pirates could only helplessly watch the ghost ship sailing away.\n\nAfter Sparrow, Smyth and Barbossa arrived at the Black rock island and they found the Trident of Poseidon at Poseidon's Tomb under the waters of the ocean, Salazar decided to possess the body of Henry Turner so he could follow his enemies on dry land. Despite Lieutenant Lesaro's warnings that he would stay trapped in the boy's body forever, Salazar replied that the Trident would set him free. Said and done, Salazar took control of Turner's body and went down to Sparrow and Smyth, where he began to fight against them while the crew of the Silent Mary saw them from within the other two parts of the sea.\n\nAfter grabbing hold of the trident, it released Salazar from Henry's body, and he began to throw Sparrow through the water, where Lieutenant Lesaro and the rest of the crew attempted to grab him and drown him. After toying with Sparrow, Salazar was annoyed by Jack's taunt which he used before he defeated Salazar years ago and stabbed Jack in the chest with the trident, shushing him as he attempted to push the trident more into his body. Jack, now realizing the Trident stabbed a book held in his jacket, urged Henry to help. Henry grabbed his sword and sent it crashing down on the Trident, breaking it in half, breaking all the curses of the sea.\n\nSalazar rested himself on a rock as he gasped for air. His crew soon realized that they could no longer breathe under water and came tumbling through the waves. Salazar realized Lieutenant Lesaro had become human again and then felt the side of his face, which had finally been filled in after all these years. Salazar looked at his hands and then to the sky laughing, for he and his crew had finally become human again.\n\nBut their pleasures were short lived, for the walls of water were slowly closing in on them. As Barbossa came flying in the Black Pearl's anchor, Salazar still intent on killing Jack began to run for it, as did the entire Silent Mary's crew. Jack, Henry, and Carina managed to climb on board, and were then quickly followed by Salazar and two of his crew members. Lieutenant Lesaro cried out for his Capitán, but was then left behind. As Salazar began to climb the anchor's chain he drew his sword, not satisfied with being human again and still eager to kill, he attempted to reach Carina and end her life.\n\nAs Barbossa realised Salazar was making his way toward his daughter, he ordered her to hold on to the chain. Jack then shouted \"Hector!\" as he threw him Henry's sword. Barbossa let go of the chain and grasped the sword and allowed himself to fall. Salazar soon saw the pirate coming toward him as Barbossa pierced him through the back with the blade, causing him to let go of the chain and knock down both of his crew members who held onto it. Salazar then came tumbling down to the ocean floor, letting out a scream of horror, which was soon silenced by him landing face first on the bottom of the anchor below, killing him. His body was then consumed by the surrounding waves, ending El Matador del Mar's reign over the Seven Seas once and for all.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Armando_Salazar"}}

His search was delayed after Jack Sparrow commandeered the Interceptor, with the help of the blacksmith apprentice Will Turner.

When he was about five or six years old, he followed his father on a mission to capture Edward Teague, a Pirate Lord and Keeper of the Code. In the midst of a chaotic battle occurring when Teague's crew came to free Teague and his son Jack Sparrow from Lawrence Norrington's ship, James was knocked into the sea and rescued by Teague. Lawrence, as grateful as he was, was humiliated that his son was rescued by a pirate.\n\nOver the years, eventually serving as an officer of the British Royal Navy, James Norrington was a kind and noble man, though he often appeared to be stoic and slightly snobbish. To his friends and colleagues, however, he showed great respect and grace, especially to Governor Weatherby Swann and his daughter Elizabeth Swann, with whom he had fallen in love. He was completely devoted to the Royal Navy, and would often forsake his own personal needs for the greater good. He harbored an intense dislike of pirates and their kind, and saw himself as something of a purveyor of justice to pirates in the Caribbean.\n\nNorrington served in the Royal Navy as a lieutenant, and was stationed aboard HMS Dauntless as it made the crossing from England, carrying Governor Swann and Elizabeth to Port Royal. Upon sighting a wrecked merchant vessel in the water, Lieutenant Norrington ordered his men to search the wreckage. He was so preoccupied with this that he did not notice a ghostly ship with black sails, the Black Pearl, slipping away from the scene.\n\nOver the years, Norrington used the Interceptor to chase and capture the Caribbean's most fearsome pirates. By eight years after the crossing from England, Norrington had become captain, was awarded with a medal of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath and, due to his loyal service, was set to achieve the rank of commodore. To mark his promotion, Norrington is given a new sword by Governor Swann. Norrington's promotion ceremony was held at Fort Charles in Port Royal, drawing a large crowd. Among those gathered was Elizabeth Swann, whom Norrington had first met on the crossing from England, and had developed a friendship with over the past eight years. However, Norrington was also in love with Elizabeth, and, since he believed a wife was the only thing missing in his life, wished for her hand in marriage.\n\nThe newly-promoted Commodore attempted to propose to Elizabeth atop the fortress, following the ceremony. However, Elizabeth, apparently overcome by the proposal\u2014though actually having fainted due to the constricting corset she had been forced into\u2014toppled over the side of the fortress and into the sea far below. Shocked, Norrington gathered his men and raced down to the harbor, where he found Elizabeth in the arms of a man in the distinctive garb of a pirate. Elizabeth's rescuer turned out to be Captain Jack Sparrow, whom Norrington took into custody, set for hanging despite his recent good deed. However, Sparrow managed to briefly escape Norrington's clutches until he was subdued in a blacksmith's shop in the town.\n\nCommodore Norrington had Sparrow imprisoned, but it was not the end of his troubles with pirates. That night, Port Royal was attacked by the Black Pearl, and though Norrington's men fought valiantly, the town was overwhelmed, and Elizabeth was captured. The next day, Norrington and his men attempted to formulate a plan to locate the Pearl, but were unsuccessful. The situation escalated further when Will Turner freed Jack Sparrow from the dungeons and helped him commandeer the HMS Interceptor to track down the Black Pearl. Norrington was forced to watch the pirates sail away with the ship, grudgingly admitting Jack's unexpected competency.\n\nNorrington was not about to give in, however. He had the Dauntless\u2014whose rudder chain had been disabled by Sparrow during his escape\u2014repaired, and set sail, now with three objectives; to reclaim the Interceptor, to capture Jack Sparrow and to rescue Elizabeth Swann. Although the Interceptor was ultimately destroyed by Captain Hector Barbossa's crew of aboard the Black Pearl, Norrington was able to achieve two of his goals when his men sighted a distress signal on a desert island. It transpired that both Elizabeth and Jack had been marooned on the island by Barbossa, while the Black Pearl set out for Isla de Muerta with Will Turner.\n\nNorrington had Jack placed under arrest, though despite Elizabeth's protests, refused to launch a rescue of Will, since it had not been his intention to follow the Pearl at all, other than if in doing so it would have ensured Elizabeth's safety. However, Elizabeth asked that Norrington change his mind for her, as a wedding gift. Norrington was stunned and delighted that Elizabeth had accepted his proposal, and agreed to her plea, even going so far as to ask for Jack's assistance in locating Isla de Muerta.\n\nUpon arrival at Isla de Muerta, however, Norrington was less than happy about the situation, especially since Jack Sparrow appeared to be controlling proceedings. Although Norrington agreed to wait outside the mouth of the pirate cave in order to ambush Barbossa's men as they emerged, the Commodore actually had no intention of following Sparrow's directives. Instead, he rowed out with a selection of his men to the island, leaving Lieutenant Gillette in command of the Dauntless. Because of this, Norrington remained unaware that the pirates were actually infiltrating the flagship and killing his crew. It was only when one of his crewmen managed to ring the ship's bell that Norrington realized what had happened.\n\nHe ordered his men to row back to the Dauntless, where they engaged the pirates in battle. Norrington himself dueled Koehler in single combat, proving to be a match for the immortal pirate. The situation seemed hopeless until Will Turner managed to reverse the curse from within the island, thus making the pirates mortal once more. Norrington killed Koehler, and, from looking the reactions of Koehler and the other pirates, realized the curse had been lifted. As he captured Twigg, Norrington proclaimed the Dauntless was theirs once more, and cries of jubilation rang out on its decks as the surviving pirates surrendered.\n\nThe Commodore ordered a return to Port Royal, where the pirates would be imprisoned. Jack Sparrow was likewise captured, and sentenced for execution. Norrington himself presided over the execution ceremony at Fort Charles, and was ready to order his marines into position when Will Turner attempted his rescue of Sparrow. However, Elizabeth pretended to faint during the chaos, drawing Norrington's attention and allowing Sparrow to escape from the gallows.\n\nThe Commodore finally caught up with Sparrow and Turner out on the battlements, where he was shocked by Elizabeth's decision to stand with Will, in protection of Jack against Norrington. James asked Elizabeth if this was truly her heart's desire, which she affirmed. Norrington accepted this with surprisingly good grace, though was at a loss as to what course of action to take when Sparrow escaped into the open waters. But the commodore was not entirely without a heart. Drawing his sword, Norrington approached Will and gave his compliments on his beautiful sword, expecting him to show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life. Norrington wished Elizabeth and Will good luck, and even decided to postpone pursuit of Jack for at least another day. With that, Commodore Norrington left the scene, his stunned men following on.\n\nHowever, it turned out Norrington didn't have to search for Sparrow because Sparrow himself \"invaded\" Port Royal alone. He was quickly captured and thrown into the dungeon. When he confronted Sparrow, Norrington commented that Jack really is the worst pirate that he ever heard of. However, Jack quickly escaped, with the secret help of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, taking one of the cursed pirates, Scurvy Joe, with him.\n\nOnce again forced to pursue Sparrow, Norrington and his men sailed for Tortuga, where they expected to find him. However, since Tortuga was oficially a French colony, Norrington and his men couldn't enter the port as members of the British Navy. After disguising themselves in civilian clothes, they found Sparrow and cornered him in one alley. However, Anamaria interrupted them, and Sparrow managed to run away. They chased him, but they were stopped by a man wearing the hat and cloak of the Governor of Tortuga. The \"governor\" threatened to arrest Norrington and his men as spies, but the real governor suddenly appeared, and it turned out that the imposter is actually Jack Sparrow in disguise. Using the governor's coach, Jack escaped once again, and the real governor also threatened to arrest Norrington and his men.\n\nWhile pursuing Jack Sparrow, Norrington's ship was believed to have been destroyed by a hurricane off Tripoli. Disgraced, Norrington resigned his post and disappeared. This was good luck on Norrington's part, because no one knew where he was when Lord Cutler Beckett had appeared with a warrant for his arrest for his part in Jack Sparrow's escape.\n\nDuring this time, James Norrington became a changed man, he started drinking heavily, and was found still wearing his Commodore uniform, albeit now rags, in Tortuga, in a bar where he applied for a position on the Black Pearl, to become a pirate himself. He became largely concerned with regaining his honor in any way possible, however, and about getting revenge on the people that he believed ruined his life.\n\nDuring his time on the Pearl Norrington did not believe Jack was telling the truth about the Chest of Davy Jones, until he actually saw the Chest and heard the heart beating within it. He seemed to have found out or guessed how Will Turner ended up on the Flying Dutchman, and also noticed the growing relationship between Jack and Elizabeth.\n\nWhen the Black Pearl arrived at Isla Cruces, Norrington was one of the crew chosen to accompany Jack Sparrow to shore. After a series of events including Will Turner's reappearance, Norrington became embroiled in a complicated three way sword fight with Jack Sparrow and the aforementioned Will Turner. This was further complicated by the arrival of the Flying Dutchman. Shortly afterwards, Norrington found the letters of marque and Davy Jones' heart in the boat where they had been left by Sparrow. He escaped with the empty chest, feigning a diversion so that the crew of the Black Pearl could escape. When Davy Jones' crew caught up to him, he tossed them the empty chest and fled.\n\nAfter being found adrift at sea, Norrington presented the heart of Davy Jones, along with the Letters of Marque to Lord Cutler Beckett. He regained his \"life\" through his newfound service to Beckett, a decision he would later come to regret. Though he merely hoped to win the commission as a privateer, Norrington was reinstated to the Royal Navy and Beckett gave him the rank of admiral for the East India Company's fleet. Now under the employ of the East India Trading Company, Norrington was given back his sword from his days as commodore. And with it, he helped command Beckett's Armada during the War Against Piracy.\n\nAfter Lord Beckett had become frustrated with Davy Jones for killing all his prey and leaving no survivors for interrogation, he placed Admiral Norrington in command of the Flying Dutchman in order to ensure that Jones did as commanded. He also decided to have Jones' heart placed onboard the Flying Dutchman to further ensure Jones's compliance. Norrington's marines kept a constant vigil over the heart with swivel guns, to use in case the crew attempted to take the chest.\n\nAfter the Empress attacked the HMS Endeavour and fled, Beckett ordered the Flying Dutchman to pursue. Norrington led the boarding party, and was reunited with Elizabeth onboard. Just then he was happy to see Elizabeth alive, as was Elizabeth, until she recalled that Norrington was now allied with her adversaries. She angrily accused him of choosing the side that murdered her father. Norrington was shocked to hear of this, and was also shocked that Elizabeth had become a pirate captain.\n\nNorrington then ordered the prisoners put into the brig and offered Elizabeth his quarters, but Elizabeth declined, choosing instead to be with her crew, and as far from Norrington as possible. Norrington pleaded with Elizabeth to understand that he did not know what atrocities Lord Beckett had ordered to be carried out, but Elizabeth would hear none of it. Norrington was otherwise stunned, as Lord Beckett\u2014the very man who had given him his life back\u2014had lied to him and was part of the death of a friend whom he had known since he was only a lieutenant in the British Royal Navy.\n\nWhile Elizabeth and her crew were in the brig aboard the Flying Dutchman, James Norrington released them, stating that he's chosen their side, allowing them to make their escape. Upon reaching the rope connecting the Empress to the Dutchman, James and Elizabeth help the crew of the Empress escape the Dutchman. However, Elizabeth was still angry with Norrington. James insisted that he had no part in her father's death, stating that he lamented his other misdeeds. Finally seeing the truth, Elizabeth requested that he go with her. But before he could answer, Bootstrap Bill Turner appeared from the top deck and went on his way down. Norrington pulled out his sword and told Elizabeth to go and reluctantly said that he would follow her, Elizabeth knew that he was lying. He told Elizabeth that even though their paths have crossed, they wouldn't truly be together. After James kissed Elizabeth, Norrington was caught by Bootstrap Bill Turner, who alerted Davy Jones and his crew of a prisoner escape. Seeing that Elizabeth was going towards him, James fired his pistol at the restraints connecting the two ships. Elizabeth managed to escape, but Norrington was fatally wounded by Turner.\n\nUpon arriving at the scene, Davy Jones asked James Norrington if he feared death. With his last breath, Norrington speared Jones with his sword before dying. Jones took that action as a \"no\". Taking out Norrington's sword, Jones admired the blade and kept it for himself. It is unknown what happened with Norrington's body or where Norrington ended up after death.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/James_Norrington"}}

Nevertheless, Jack allowed the Magliores and Tumen to join his crew, and together explored the City of the Dead, and survived a confrontation with Torrents.\n\nWith some treasure taken from Stone-Eyed Sam's treasure vault, the crew decided to search for the legendary Sword of Cortés, which was now in possession of Left-Foot Louis. During the journey, Jean told his new friends about his first encounter with Louis and how he swore to skin Constance alive. Some time later, the crew began hearing some strange sound, and when the sound died down, the crew discovered that some island has mysteriously appeared not far away on the horizon.\n\nFollowing the directions from the Scabbard of the Sword of Cortés, the crew sailed or Isla Fortuna, where they found the island completely deserted. After taking some rest in the local inn, they split up, starting a search for the vanished citizens.\n\nDuring the search, Tumen and Jean were captured by Left-Foot Louis and two of his thugs. However, Jack and Fitzwilliam managed to defeat Louis and his men, and the two friends were liberated. When Arabella Smith pointed the Sword of Cortés at Louis, he suddenly vanished. Though his friends believed that Louis is dead, Jean said it's possible that he was turned into a zombie.\n\nLater, Jean witnessed Jack's summoning of Hernán Cortés' spirit. However, when the undead conquistador materialized before them, Tumen started feeling ill, and the crew retreated to the inn, except Jack, who wanted to learn from Cortés how to control the power of his legendary sword.\n\nWhen Cortés turned the Barnacle into the mighty warship called the Grand Barnacle, Jack took the Sword and left the island, leaving his friends behind. When he returned a few days later, Tumen died and Jack turned against Cortés, releasing the spirits of slaughtered Aztecs from the Eye of Stone-Eyed Sam. The spirit of Montecuhzoma defeated Cortés and resurrected Tumen.\n\nThe whole crew then sailed for the Pantano River and Tia Dalma's shack, where Jean asked the voodoo witch to turn his sister back into her human form, but Tia Dalma replied that the power he needed was now lying in Jack Sparrow's hands.\n\nThe Barnacle than sailed for the Yucatán Peninsula, where Tumen intended to rejoin his tribe. When the crew arrived to the village, they were introduced to Tumen's cousis, and his grandfather, Mam. But that same night, someone stole the Sun-and-stars amulet from the village, and Jean and his friends were the first suspects.\n\nForced to leave the village, the crew of the Barnacle decided to find the real thieves. Not long into their journey, the Barnacle encounters a completely bronzed-over ship, complete with bronzed sailors who had somehow been frozen in place by the metal.\n\nThe next day, the crew of the Barnacle arrived to New Orleans, where they discovered that the medallion was stolen by Tim Hawk on Madame Minuit's orders. After fighting against Madame Minuit's followers at the Masquerade ball in a hotel, Hawk turned against Madame Minuit, and Jean and his friend managed to return to the Barnacle.\n\nHowever, the Barnacle was intercepted in the middle of the sea by the Fleur de la Mort, a pirate ship captained by Laura Smith, Arabella's mother. The young adventurers were teleported onboard the Fleur by Silverback, a pirate with magical powers. They also saw their old nemesis Left-Foot Louis among the crewmembers. Though it looked that Louis and Silverback are enemies, they raised a mutiny against Captain Smith. However, the crew of the Barnacle helped Captain Smith to crush the mutiny and Silverback and Louis had to escape in the longboat. Jean and his friends once again boarded the Barnacle, determined to return to New Orleans, but Captain Smith forced Arabaella to stay onboard the Fleur.\n\nAfter their return to New Orleans, the crew of the Barnacle discovered that the city is now completely controlled by Madame Minuit and her Pirate Guard. Now that the whole city was turned into silver, Madame Minuit intended to tear the city apart and ship it in pieces to Europe to sell it.\n\nThe crew of the Barnacle than fought against Minuit and her new allies Left-Foot Louis and Silverback. In the end, Jack Sparrow was able to kill Minuit, Louis, and Silverback. However, almost the entire crew of the Barnacle, including Jean, decided to join Captain Laura Smith onboard the La Fleur de la Mort.\n\nJean spent some time as a sailor onboard the La Fleur de la Mort. He participated in the quest for the Trident of Poseidon. Afterwards, he left to find a way to turn Constance into a human once more.\n\nA few years after their adventures with Jack Sparrow, Constance was reverted back to her human form, and Jean was working as a sailor on a merchant ship. One day, while his ship was docked in New Orleans, Jean was reunited with Jack, who in the meantime became captain of the pirate ship called the Black Pearl. Jean happily joined Jack's crew, but knowing that Jack wouldn't accept Constance on his ship, he introduced her as \"his cousin Marcella\". Together, they sailed to find the mystical magical elixir known as the Shadow Gold.\n\nWhen the Black Pearl arrived to Easter Island, Jean and Marcella were among the crewmembers who went ashore to find new supplies. However, Marcella was kidnapped by the islanders. When their chief demanded ransom, Jean was ready to give it, but Jack stopped him and said they'll just leave Marcella with them. Terrified, the chief agreed to free her and gave them much needed supplies.\n\nThough Jean didn't participate in Jack's search for the Deep Sea Opal, he was with him when Jack had to go on a meeting with the Chinese Pirate Lord Mistress Ching in Hong Kong. Disguised as the East India Trading Company soldiers, Jack, Jean, and a few other crewmembers managed to reach Ching's opium den. Where they were also accompanied by the new Pirate Lord of Singapore, Sao Feng. However, the meeting was interrupted by Lord Benedict Huntington, the EITC manager of Hong Kong, who brought dozens of his agents to destroy them all. However, the pirates ultimately won the battle.\n\nWhen the Pearl was sailing off the coast of India, it was suddenly attacked by the Otter, the ship of the Pirate Lord Sumbhajee Angria. It was Jean who took the white flag of parley and waved it in the air, causing the Otter to stop firing. When they arrived to Suvarnadurg, they were all invited to Sri Sumbhajee's palace.\n\nOne inside the palace, as Sri Sumbhajee's guest, Jean was placed in the same room with Jack. When Sri Sumbhajee's aide Askay brought a small masked warrior to \"protect\" Jack (actually to make sure that Jack wouldn't steal anything), Jack tried to guess the warrior's name but then attacked him. In the ensuing fight, Jean got tangled with the warrior and accidentally tore off his scarf, discovering that the warrior is actually the most beautiful woman he ever saw. When he refused to give her back her scarf unless she tells him her name, she introduced herself as Lakshmi.\n\nLater, when they all gathered for a dinner, the food taster died beacuse the food was poisoned. Later, Lakshmi brough Jean some food fom the kitchen. Jean then asked her to marry him, and she said she'll do that, but only after her debt to Sri Sumbhajee is repaied. A day later, it was revealed that Sumbhajje's younger brother Toolajee was the one who was trying to poison Sumbhajee so he could become the Pirate Lord himself. The island was then suddenly attacked by by the combined force of Royal Marines and EITC soldiers led by Benedict Huntington. During the battle, Jean fought alongside Lakshmi. Thanks to Jack Sparrow, the pirates managaed to defeat the invaders. Later, before the Black Pearl sailed away, Jean said goodbye to Lakshmi, promising to come back for her one day.\n\nAfter a violent storm, the Black Pearl entered the bay on the coast of Madagascar. But when Jack Sparrow saw the pirate port of Libertalia at the end of the bay, he wanted to turn the ship around, but Jean and Barbossa managed to convince him to dock the ship there. When they finally left the ship, they were all introduced to Captain Edward Teague, Jack's father and Keeper of the Code, who invited them to dine in his mansion. However, the dinner was interrupted when the former slave Jocard and his pirates attacked the mansion, because they believed that the infamous Pirate Lord Samuel was there. After a short fight, they all agreed to attack Samuel's fort together.\n\nDuring the journey through the jungles of Madagascar, Jean found and ate some purple berries which caused him to fall into a hypnotic trance. The berries gave him the ability to see the future for a short time. He then predicted the Day of the Shadow and that Jack would be betrayed and end up on an island with lots of rum. He also spoke about some undead pirates, cursed gold, and the cursed monkey.\n\nLater, Jean participated in the battle in Samuel's fort, which Jocard's and Jack's pirates ultimately won. Before the Black Pearl departed from Libertalia, Jean thought that he could live there with Lakshmi once the Quest for the Shadow Gold is over.\n\nWhen the Black Pearl finally arrived to France, the pirates were suddenly attacked by the Spanish mariners. Many pirates were captured, though they were later freed through combined efforts of Jack Sparrow and the French Pirate Lord Chevalle. In the final battle for the Shadow Gold, pirates had to fight against the combined forces of the Spanish Navy, the East India Trading Company, and the Shadow Army of the Shadow Lord, who was revealed to be none other than the former Pirate Lord Henry Morgan. The pirates managed to destroy Morgan and his allies, but when Carolina decided to leave Jack's crew, take one of the abandoned Spanish ships and become captain herself, Jean chose to come with her.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jean_Magliore"}}

His head was conical with crusty, coral-like green flesh and a pair of round yellow eyes sunk into slit-shaped sockets. Greenbeard also had mussels for teeth. As he had become very plantlike, he did not need to eat or sleep. Additionally, he seems to have had a moderate case of Tourette Syndrome, causing his head to twitch involuntarily to one side or another.\n\nWhen the crew boarded a wreck, it was he who killed the Chaplain, and got help by Ratlin to throw the body overboard. After Will Turner joined the crew and stole the key to the Dead Man's Chest from Jones, Greenbeard was approached by Bootstrap Bill Turner, who informed him the captain wanted Bootstrap to relieve Greenbeard. The navigator snarled in response, likely not believing Turner, though relinquished his post anyway. It transpired that Bootstrap had indeed been lying, and had been helping his son escape the Flying Dutchman. Afterward, Greenbeard, along with other crewmembers, was chosen to reclaim Jones' chest and key on Isla Cruces. He was also one of the crewmembers that was run over by Will and James Norrington's wheel. Later, he was seen at the helm of the Flying Dutchman when the ship rose from underneath the sea to ambush the Black Pearl. At Jones' orders, he turned the ship to the starboard side in order for it's crew members to get a clear shot at the Black Pearl.\n\nSometime after the East India Trading Company gained control of the Dutchman, he fought in the battle around Calypso's maelstrom, during which he fought one of Jack Sparrow's crewmen with his bare fists when Sparrow attempted to steal the Dead Man's Chest. He transformed back to his human form as Will Turner became the new captain of the Dutchman.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Greenbeard"}}

In Rome he ran into Caraccioli - a \"lewd Priest\" who over the course of long voyages with little to do but talk, gradually converted Misson and a sizeable portion of the rest of the crew to his way of thinking:\n\nEmbarking on a career of piracy, the 200 strong crew of the Victoire called upon Misson to be their captain. They shared the wealth of the ship, deciding \"all should be in common.\" All decisions were to be put to \"the Vote of the whole Company.\" Thus they set out on their new \"Life of Liberty.\" Off the west coast of Africa they captured a Dutch slave ship. The slaves were freed and brought aboard the Victoire, Misson declaring that \"the Trading for those of our own Species, cou'd never be agreeable to the Eyes of divine Justice: That no Man had Power of Liberty of another\" and that \"he had not exempted his Neck from the galling Yoak of Slavery, and asserted his own Liberty, to enslave others.\" At every engagement they added to their numbers with new French, English and Dutch recruits, and freed African slaves.\n\nWhile cruising round the coast of Madagascar, Misson found a perfect bay in an area with fertile soil, fresh water and friendly natives. Here the pirates built Libertalia, which became one of the safest places for pirates in the Indian Ocean.

She was an exceptionally quick-witted and intuitive individual, as seen in her ability to quickly deduce that Jack was seeking out Pirate Lords, pick up on the complicated feelings between Carolina and Diego, figure out that Sarah was untrustworthy, and understand the potential merit to Jean's prophecies. She and her grandson appeared engaged in a perpetual competition over which of the two was actually the greatest pirate in the family."],"name":"Grandmama","description":"In her youth, Grandmama was an infamous pirate captain, garnering enough respect to eventually be named Lord of the Atlantic Ocean. She was present during the second meeting of the Brethren Court, where Morgan and Bartholomew first set down the Pirate Code. She also had the distinction of being the youngest Pirate Lord ever until her grandson joined as Lord of the Caribbean. During the time of the Shadow Lord's threat, Grandmama was the only Pirate Lord from the Second Brethren Court still alive.\n\nAt some point, Grandmama gave birth to a son and became matriarch and head of the Sparrow family until her child, Teague, grew up and took over responsibility for running the clan. The Sparrow family had a tendency to break out into brawls with each other whenever they gathered, with Grandmama herself often having to fend off attacks from \"Quick Draw\" McFleming with the daggers she kept in her girtle. At some point she and her son developed a friendship with double-dealing navy officer Joshamee Gibbs, who was present at her seventy-fourth birthday party. When Teague had a son of his own, Jack, Grandmama took an influential role in the discipline of her grandchild, whom she dealt with rather harshly (though Teague insisted this was how she demonstrated her caring for Jack). She'd routinely give Jack thrashings so severe she nearly beat him to death three times, and had him locked up in the brig when her cousin Mabeltrude the Violent Visionary prophecied that he'd set her ship on fire when he was eight. Her incessant torturing of Jack was a major part of the reason why he decided to run away from their home in Shipwreck Cove when Grandmama was eighty-two. Despite her perpetual cruelty towards Jack, it appeared she had a genuine love for her grandson deep down, as she nearly died of a broken heart upon learning he had run away.\n\nShortly after Jack Sparrow and his crew arrived in Libertalia, they encountered Teague, who insisted on bringing them back to the family manor where Grandmama awaited them. Grandmama greeted her grandson and the majority of his crew quite frostily, with the notable exception being Hector Barbossa, whom she quickly began flirting with.\n\nAt Teague's request, Grandmama and their guests all sat down to supper together in the manor's exuberently luxorious dining hall. As Grandmama and Teague learned of Jack's recent encounters with the other Pirate Lords, Grandmama began discussing her own days as a former member of the Brethren Court to Jack's impressed crew. At Diego de Leon's inquiry she also disclosed her true personal feelings towards Bartholomew (\"...everything a pirate should be...fierce, quick to anger, violent, conniving, the whole package\") and Morgan (\"a pretty useless pirate\").\n\nLater, when Gentleman Jocard led a raid on Teague's manor, Grandmama was able to make skilled use of her daggers against the intruders even in the thick darkness. With her help, Teague, Jack, and the Black Pearl crew were able to subdue Jocard's men and explain that they were not, as Jocard had thought, hosting King Samuel. As a plan was formulated between Jack, Carolina, and Jocard to break into Samuel's fortress, Grandmama decided she wanted to be part of the action.\n\nWhen Jack, Jocard, and their crews met up at the dock to initiate their surprise attack, Grandmama showed up and despite Jack's objections, insisted on joining their quest, asserting that they \"need a real pirate on this mission\". When Jocard's Portuguese fiancé, Sarah, arrived at the dock to guide them through the harsh Libertalian jungles, Grandmama suddenly threw off her coat, let out a blood-curdling scream, and tackled Sarah to the ground. After a furious fight that led to both women rolling into the waters below, Diego and Carolina eventually managed to haul Grandmama off the other woman long enough for Marcus, Jocard's first mate, to help Sarah back onto the dock. Grandmama insisted that Sarah was actually Teresa, the mother of King Samuel, whom she remembered meeting right after Teresa had given birth to her son, but Sarah waved off Grandmama as senile. As Grandmama attempted to attack her once more, Sarah conceded that her family was distantly related to the mother of King Samuel but that she died long ago (though even this was an exaggeration of the actual truth). Grandmama continued to remain wary of Sarah as she guided their party to King Samuel's fortress.\n\nGrandmama's suspicions of Sarah were ultimately warranted, as it turned out she was in fact Samuel's half-sister and was leading her fiancé and the rest of the pirates into a trap at the fortress. After Jocard, Barbossa, Jean, Diego, and Carolina were captured in an ambush by Samuel's men, Grandmama quickly came to the rescue, setting off the same elaborate decoy-ship rouse Jack had already tricked Samuel and his men with so she could sneak into the fort herself. After skewering several pirates on her way up to the chamber where her mates were being held, Grandmama quickly freed them all from their bonds with a dagger before leading the charge into the throne room. After commenting that she knew Sarah \"looked too much like that hag Teresa\", Grandmama fearlessly launched herself at a crowd of guards, and Barbossa chased after her. Together, they managed to fend off the men surrounding the throne and capture the traitor Sarah.\n\nOnce her grandson managed to take down King Samuel and acquire his vial of Shadow Gold, Grandmama and the rest of the party sailed back to Libertalia, where her son awaited them. As Teague wished his son goodbye before his final departure from the pirate utopia, Grandmama added a not-so-subtle \"good riddance\" before beginning to stomp away, indicating that her adventure with Jack did little to change her ultimate esteem of him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Grandmama"}}

However during his duel with Barbossa, they were both immortal. Sparrow was frequently captured and disarmed but he preferred escape or negotiation rather than combat. However, being the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean and having the highest bounty on his head out of all other Pirate Lords might indicate that he was much more skilled in battle than he let on; alternatively he could have just annoyed and escaped more people than the others. It was known that he learned swordplay from an Italian fencing master in exchange for captured Chinese silk. The payment for the fencing lessons came from the merchant ship which Edward Teague captured off the coast of Portugal when Jack served onboard the Troubadour."],"name":"Jack Sparrow","description":"Jack Sparrow was born to Edward Teague and an unknown female on a pirate ship caught in the middle of a typhoon. Jack grew up in a tumultuous household full of outlaws at Shipwreck Cove. He spent most of his youth unsure whether Edward Teague was really his parent, frequently referring to him as \"The-Man-Who-Might-Be-Father\". Despite Jack's resentment of Teague, he respected the fact that Teague was always there for him when he needed him most, such as when he nearly got his hand cut off by the pirate Rusty Knickers or when he was almost sold into slavery by Captain Lucille Graven. Jack was determined to follow in Teague's footsteps and become a captain of a ship, rather than just some ordinary pirate like the majority of his relatives (explaining his insistence on being referred to as \"Captain\" well into adulthood). At some point during his childhood, Jack met a boy named Benny and taught him \"that trick with the kite and the key\".\n\nAs a teenager, Jack served as a cabin boy on several pirate ships, including the Troubadour of Captain Teague and the Koldunya of Borya Palachnik. As a member of Teague's crew, he visited many countries and ports, including Singapore. However, he became fed up with his hectic life in a pirate family and the torturing of his Grandmama. One night, he snuck by candlelight into the study to consult the Pirata Codex, and, coming upon a section on freedom and the need for pirates to make their own decisions, decided he was completely justified in running away. After escaping out the window, Jack stowed away aboard a merchant ship to reach Tortuga.\n\nJack had few worldly possessions, and even these were stolen on the island. In attempting to reclaim his property, Jack accidentally stole a sack containing the scabbard of the Sword of Cortés from Captain Torrents, a vicious pirate captain with the ability to control storms. Learning of its magical nature from a barmaid named Arabella Smith, Jack set off to track down the Sword of Cortés itself.\n\nAfter Arabella leads Jack to an abandoned ship, the Barnacle, he was given command, and, following a sword fight that Jack lost, found his second crew member in a man named Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III. Having braved a storm conjured by Torrents, Jack, Arabella and Fitzwilliam soon encountered two more sailors, Tumen and Jean Magliore\u2014the latter providing one further crew member in the form of his cat, Constance Magliore, who was once Jean's sister before being transformed by Tia Dalma.\n\nWith a ship and a crew, not to mention part of the treasure of Stone-Eyed Sam, a now-dead former pirate king with a fabled stone eye who was said to be holding the Sword, Captain Jack Sparrow set off to find the elusive Sword of Cortés. The crew was confronted by Captain Torrents, though Jack was able to counter his control of lightning by splashing him with rainwater collected in his appropriated hat. He claimed that he had taught a young Benjamin Franklin this trick, and hoped \"Benny\" would remember it.\n\nJack's crew later happened upon a group of mermaids whose song made most of the crew act upon their deepest desires. However, Jack proved immune to their song, since his only true desire was freedom. Unfortunately for Jack, poorly-thought-out negotiations with the Sirens' minions, the merfolk, forced him into a deal that would cost him the thing Jack valued most \u2014 his freedom \u2014 should he ever find the Sword of Cortés. For the time being, he continued his search for the Sword, ultimately finding it in the possession of Left-Foot Louis on Isla Fortuna. Jack helped defeat Louis, and stopped Arabella from killing the pirate out of revenge for the supposed murder of her mother.\n\nWith the Sword and its scabbard in his possession, Jack was able to recite an incantation that unlocked its power\u2014but also caused the spirit of Hernán Cortés to materialize. Jack, wishing to use the Sword's full power, was unaware that Cortés, in teaching Jack how to correctly wield the Sword, was ensuring he, Cortés, would ultimately regain control of the weapon for his own dastardly use. Jack was sent to collect the eye of Stone-Eyed Sam, recently given to the merfolk, meaning Jack was forced to return to Isla Sirena. There, he fought two iguana monsters for his freedom, and obtained the eye from Tia Dalma. Tia Dalma also reminded Jack that a dangerous foe was still pursuing him, a thought that Jack did not savor.\n\nSparrow returned to Cortés, and unlocked the eye, freeing the spirit of Montecuhzoma, who fought and defeated Cortés. Jack decided to give the Sword to Tia Dalma, realizing it contained too much power to wield. After a further meeting with her, who warned him of dangers he would yet face, Jack and his crew set out for Yucatán Peninsula, home of Tumen, and further adventure.\n\nUnfortunately for Sparrow and his crew, Tumen's village held its own set of challenges. The crew became the main suspects when the Sun-and-stars amulet was stolen from the village, and were banished from the island. Jack resolved to track down the real culprits, whom they happened upon in a hotel in New Orleans. The thief, Madame Minuit, fought for possession of the amulet\u2014a blow from which turning some of Jack's teeth bronze\u2014though her slave, Tim Hawk, turned on her and helped Jack's crew escape. Jack welcomed him aboard the Barnacle.\n\nMoments later, the ship was confronted by La Fleur de la Mort, captained by Laura Smith, Arabella's long-lost mother. The crew was teleported aboard, where Jack was confronted by Silverback and Left-Foot Louis, both of whom launched an attack on Jack's crew. The fight was broken up by Laura, though Jack remained suspicious of both pirates, and eavesdropped on a conversation between them, uncovering their plans to mutiny against their captain. This led to a fight, during which Jack stole Silverback's gem, connecting it to his medallion and making both Silverback and Louis disappear. Jack was happy to return to the Barnacle, though Laura kept her daughter aboard La Fleur de la Mort.\n\nFollowing this, Jack returned to New Orleans, where he was confronted for a final time by Madame Minuit, Silverback and Louis, who merged to form a giant, three-headed serpent that Jack barely managed to defeat. Jack's teeth were turned into gold when the Sun-and-stars amulet was destroyed. With the battle won, Jack's crew decided to return to their respective homes, leaving only Jack and Fitzwilliam aboard the Barnacle. Suddenly, the vessel was confronted by the Flying Dutchman, and Jack met Davy Jones for the first time.\n\nDavy Jones was after Fitzwilliam's watch, which was able to stop time. Using the watch's power, Jack and Dalton escaped to a nearby island. After wandering for a few days, they were captured by angry natives and sacrificed to Chantico. They escaped again using the Timekeeper and ran to an Aztec temple. There, they discover that they are on Isla Esquelética while Stone-Eyed Sam still reigned as king. They were captured and taken to Stone-Eyed Sam. Once again they escaped using the Timekeeper and escaped the temple.\n\nBy now the island was completely disrupted; there were prehistoric creatures roaming around and Stone-Eyed Sam was very much alive and in control of the Sword of Cortés and, to make matters worse, Captain Torrents was around and wanted his revenge on Jack. After escaping being killed by the lava of the island's volcano, Jack and Fitzwilliam were told by Chantico that they have twelve hours to set everything back to normal or she will kill them. After getting down the volcano by way of hitching a ride on the pterodactyl, the two of them needed magic of Tia Dalma's kind and headed back to the Barnacle by traveling underwater with a tipped over boat over their heads for air. Once they were on the Barnacle, they were quickly captured by Davy Jones and thrown into the brig of the Flying Dutchman where they ran into Tia Dalma who helped them get out and gave them a clue as to how to return time back to normal, that the watch has to be in the possession of someone who doesn't exist in the present time and also that the person has to drop the watch when it chimes twelve. After getting back to the island, and realizing that there is only one hour left, a sword fight starts between Stone-Eyed Sam and Torrents for control of the Sword of Cortés. During their fight, Jack realized that he has to get Sam to hold the watch to set everything back so he gets the attention of both him and Torrents when Jack remembers that the both of them want revenge on him. Things escalated into a three-way sword fight with the Sword of Cortés changing hands several times with time running out. Jack carefully throws the watch so that it wraps around Sam's wrist as the watch starts chiming. Just as Jack was knocked down and Sam about to kill him, the watch chimed for the twelfth time and Tia Dalma pulled it off Sam's wrist and time was quickly set back to normal, with Stone-Eyed Sam turning into a skeleton, the buildings crumbling into rubble, and the plant life of the jungle taking over. After Tia Dalma met with Davy Jones and Chantico met with Tia Dalma, surprising Jack and Fitzwilliam by bowing to her, Jack noticed a pirate ship in the distance and panics. Both he and Fitzwilliam got back to the Barnacle where they see that the pirate ship was being chased by British Royal Navy ships as well as East India Trading Company ships. Fitzwilliam then held his sword to Jack's back and reveals that he had been working with the Navy in an attempt to track down Jack's father, Captain Edward Teague, to arrest and hang him.\n\nFitzwilliam P. Dalton III is really working for the Royal Navy as a spy and has led Admiral Lawrence Norrington and the whole Royal Navy, to Jack and his father, Captain Teague (Keeper of the Code), himself. Jack and his father are taken off of Teague's ship, the Misty Lady, and sent to the brig of Norrington's ship. Aboard the ship is a rum-lover and ally of Teague's, Joshamee Gibbs. He frees Jack, Teague, and his crew. Jack boards the Barnacle to take off a Royal Navy flag and to sail away when Fitzwilliam shows up and they then battle rapidly back and forth. When Jack finally wins, he's about to kill Fitzy when his father stops him. Then the Royal Navy wakes up and begins to attack The Misty Lady. Meanwhile, Fitzwilliam somehow follows Teague's commands and the three of them end up on the Admiral's ship once more. The aristocrat then turns in Teague and Jack, who are hiding behind barrels. A fight breaks out between the two crews and Jack and Fitzy take at it one more time. Teague and the Admiral fight and when Teague successfully knocks down the Admiral, his son, James Norrington, is frightened and backs up only to fall overboard. Teague rescues James and his father chastises him about being saved by a pirate. Teague tells Jack the Fitzy only did as he was told because of the ring that makes anyone do anything you'd like. He gives Jack the ring and then takes him to Isle Hermosa. In the story's epilogue, Jack gets a new boat, only large enough for one or two people, and sets sail for a new treasure.\n\nAfter acquiring a new boat, Jack sets off to find the fabled Poseidon's Peak and the treasure it holds. He arrives on a deserted island and runs into a sailor who is badly hurt and has amnesia. Following a night of fitful dreams the sailor remembers that his name is Bill and the two of them trek inland to find any clues to where Poseidon's Peak might be. Before long the two are captured by the natives, with Bill inexplicably able to translate what they're saying and are challenge to fight for their lives. Jack cheats and the both of them run into someone very familiar, Constance Magliore, who the natives worship since she swam out of the sea.\n\nAfter getting away from the natives, Jack has the idea of lashing logs together to make a raft to escape the island and while they search, they unearth a chariot covered in sea life. They get on the chariot and it prompt takes them out to sea where the jump off it before it submerges and end up on a small rock in the middle of the ocean. Jack, in a fit of anger, tosses Constance off the rock which causes her to lead them to an underwater cavern. Constance proceeds to lead them through tunnels that seem to go in circles until Jack meets a group of people that are very familiar to him, the former crew of the Barnacle (sans Fitzwilliam), along with Arabella's mother and her crew.\n\nJack is especially glad to see Arabella but is dismayed when she runs up and kisses Bill who has regained the rest of his memories and says that he was rescued by Captain Smith's ship sometime after they had split from Jack. Not too long after this, a group of mermaids, of a higher level than the ones Jack has met before, ask them to keep the items belonging to Poseidon (his trident and chariot) away from Davy Jones who would use them to manipulate their kind, and in exchange they would show them how to escape the cavern. Shortly after the request, an unwanted face shows up riding the chariot and wielding Trident of Poseidon, Captain Torrents.\n\nIn order to retrieve the chariot and trident, Jack challenges Torrents to a duel to the death, in which Jack is ultimately victorious. The Sirens are then reunited with the chariot and trident and in gratitude show Jack, the former captain of the Barnacle, Laura Smith, captain of La Fleur de la Mort, and Smith's crewmen the escape route. Upon returning to the surface, Jack farewells his ex-crew for the last time and departs, thus ending his teenage adventures.\n\nFollowing his teenage adventures, Jack bartered a magical compass from Tia Dalma. However, the compass somehow found its way into the hands of Morgan, the pirate captain of the Wicked Wench, whose crew Jack eventually joined, finally embracing the pirate life. It was around that time that the notorious Spanish Royal Navy capitán Armando Salazar decided to exterminate piracy in the Caribbean, to avenge the deaths of his father and grandfather. With their powerful warship, the Silent Mary, Salazar and his crew sank dozens of pirate ships.\n\nFacing extermination, the last pirates in the Caribbean joined forces in an attempt to stop Salazar, but in a fierce battle off the coast of the mysterious Devil's Triangle the Spaniards destroyed most of the pirate fleet, showing no mercy. The Wicked Wench was the last remaining pirate ship, and her dying captain gave his compass to Jack, explaining its power with his last breath. When the compass pointed toward the Triangle, Jack quickly formulated a plan how to defeat Salazar.\n\nClimbing into the crow's nest, Jack shouted through the smoke to the pirate hunter, mockingly telling him that he will be spared if he surrenders immediately. Laughing and sliding down the halyard on deck, Jack defiantly raised the black pirate flag, earning the right to call himself Sparrow. He took the helm, steering the Wench toward the Triangle. Just as Jack expected, the Silent Mary, with Salazar at the helm, quickly followed the pirate vessel into the unknown waters. As the Wench approached the entrance into the Triangle, Jack ordered the pirates to throw ropes around the nearby reefs off the port side of the ship. The loop caught the reef, tightening, and causing the ship to swiftly turn to the left, as Jack Sparrow steered the ship in the same direction, changing the Wench's course at the last moment.\n\nThe Silent Mary stayed on her course, sailing straight ahead. As the Spanish sailed past the Wench Jack glanced at Salazar one last time before the Silent Mary entered the Triangle. The Spanish warship quickly hit the nearby rocks which resulted in a massive explosion that killed the entire crew and sank the ship. With the battle over, every surviving pirate in the Wench's crew gave Jack one item as a tribute, including a hat.\n\nJack eventually returned to Shipwreck Cove where he became known to all Pirate Lords, even though Teague wasn't yet prepared to officially recognize Jack as his son. Despite that, Jack joined Teague on several voyages on his ship, the Troubadour. Jack also became a good friend with the French pirate captain Christophe-Julien de Rapièr.\n\nWhen some mysterious pirate ships began to attack both merchant ships and pirate ships, a meeting was held in the Pirate Hall in Shipwreck City. Although he wasn't invited, Jack entered the chamber where some of the Pirate Lords convened because he was interested in meeting Esmeralda, with whom he developed a friendship, and her grandfather Don Rafael, the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. Jack also met Hector Barbossa, a pirate captain whose ship, the Cobra, was destroyed by these mysterious rogue pirates.\n\nA few months later, Jack discovered which ship destroyed Barbossa's ship. It was the sloop Koldunya, captained by Boris \"Borya\" Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea. Thanks to Jack's information, Barbossa also identified the ship. To quickly solve the case, Captain Teague summoned Davy Jones, the Lord of the sea, who identified Borya as the leader of the rogues. Trapped, Borya revealed the names of other rogue captains, identifying Christophe as one of them. The rogues were quickly imprisoned in the dungeons of Shipwreck City. However, Jack believed that Christophe was innocent, and so he helped him escape. But by doing this, he broke the Pirate Code, making himself an outlaw in the eyes of the Brethren. During their escape from Shipwreck Island, Christophe's rogues kidnapped Jack, taking him with them.\n\nPress-ganged into a service on La Vipère, Jack involuntarily served under Christophe for a few weeks. Christophe even started to make plans for making his own fleet, and he asked Jack to join him as captain of one of his vessels. Jack participated in the Attack on the Dutch flute, and after the battle, he met Pharaoh Taharka, the ruler of the mythical island of Kerma. Mortally wounded, the old Pharaoh gave Jack the magical talisman. Christophe took the talisman from Jack, and decided to find Kerma. Not wanting Jack with him anymore, Christophe left him in a longboat on the open sea. Robert Greene, a young pirate onboard La Vipère, jumped into the sea and joined Jack in the boat. After they reached land, they joined the East India Trading Company. For the next five years, Jack faithfully served the Company, sailing across all the Seven Seas, eventually reaching the rank of First Mate.\n\nWhen he was 25 years old, Jack sailed aboard the EITC brig Fair Wind as the First Mate under Captain Nathaniel Bainbridge. When Bainbridge was killed in a battle with pirates led by Jack's old love interest Esmeralda, now a Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, Jack took command of the Fair Wind and managed to save the ship and most of its cargo from falling into the hands of Esmeralda's pirates. Cutler Beckett, an EITC Director for West Africa, was so impressed, that he offered him to take command of Marlin, a slave ship of the Company, as her captain. But Sparrow refused to transport slaves, and Beckett gave him command of the Wicked Wench, a merchant vessel of the Company.\n\nJack Sparrow and the Wicked Wench were an unbeatable team, and Jack sailed on many voyages for the Company. One day, Beckett proposed to Jack to organize a search for the lost island of Kerma, and the Shining City of Zerzura with the treasure-filled labyrinth. Jack embarked on a voyage, assisted by Beckett's house slave, Ayisha, who was actually princess Amenirdis, a member of Kerman royal family.\n\nJack and Ayisha sailed for the Bahamas, where they liberated Ayisha's brother, prince Shabako because Ayisha refused to give Jack the location of the island until her brother was safe. After they sailed back for Africa, the Wench was attacked by Boris Palachnik's rogue pirates. Ayisha's magic destroyed the pirate ship, but the Wicked Wench was badly damaged. Jack and his crew were saved by Esmeralda, whose crew helped Jack to repair his ship. A few days later, with the help of his compass, Jack found Christophe-Julien de Rapièr, whose help he needed to open the gates of the Zerzuran labyrinth.\n\nThe Wench and La Vipère sailed for Kerma, where Jack, Amenirdis, and Christophe entered the labyrinth. They found the treasure, and Jack tricked Christophe into taking a rock instead of the Heart of Zerzura. Beliving that he has the famous jewel, Christophe sailed off. Jack, who developed atraction toward Amenirdis, decided not to reveal the location of Kerma to Beckett, knowing that Beckett would enslave the inhabitants of the legendary island.\n\nA few days later, the Wench returned to Calabar. Beckett, angry that Sparrow had betrayed him, ordered Sparrow to carry a cargo of slaves to New Avalon in the Caribbean for Viscount Penwallow, Beckett's immediate supervisor and patron. Jack Sparrow set off with the Wicked Wench's hold filled with slaves following his pick up, but he couldn't stand the idea of humans beings as \"cargo,\" so he resolved to free them. Jack sailed back to illusion-hidden Kerma, and the island's ruler, Pharaoh Shabako, agreed to give the slaves asylum there. Furious at being disobeyed, Cutler Beckett sent five EITC ships after Jack, and when he finally caught him, had Jack thrown into prison.\n\nAfter languishing for a couple of months, he ordered him brought within sight of the Wicked Wench about a mile off the coast of Western Africa. Beckett and his operative, Ian Mercer, branded Jack with a \"P\" brand on his right forearm, marking him forever as a pirate. Then Beckett ordered his ship to fire on the anchored Wicked Wench, using inflammable \"carcass charges.\" Seeing his beloved Wench in flames, Jack Sparrow broke free from his captors, dived into the ocean and swam for his ship, hoping to rescue her. But it was lost, as Jack was trapped in his own cabin and went down with his sunken ship. Neither dead nor alive, Jack found himself in a strange place. Knowing that he's on the path to the Land of the Dead, Jack spoke the magical incantation, thus summoning Davy Jones, the Lord of the sea.\n\nJack struck a bargain with Jones. In exchange for resurrection of the Wicked Wench, Jack promised to give up his position as captain of the Wicked Wench in thirteen years time to serve for a century aboard Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman. Jack, however, had no intention of keeping his end of the bargain, having become too attached to his ship. Inspired by the Biblical parable of \"the pearl of great price\", he rechristened it the Black Pearl, and set out for a life of adventure as a pirate.\n\nHis early pirate life was the subject of many legends and rumors about his exploits, some of which were most likely mis-truths possibly made up by Sparrow himself to bolster his reputation. One of these legends told of how he sacked Port Nassau without firing a single shot, while his other notable exploits included impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy and a cleric of the Church of England. He became a friend with the infamous pirate Jolly Roger, who performed unsavory deeds for the Brethren Court, in hope of achieving a position among them. It was believed that Jack became chief of the Pelegostos in the years prior to meeting Elizabeth Swann, a tale he relayed to Mullroy and Murtogg at Port Royal. He picked up the cannibals' language which he again used during his second visit to their village to escape the Kraken. He also met Angelica, a novice from a Spanish convent. Jack seduced her and corrupted her, introducing her to the life of piracy. They had several adventures together, but their relationship didn't end well.\n\nWhen Captain Teague left the Court to become a Keeper of the Code, he gave his seat to Jack. But instead of becoming a Pirate Lord of Madagascar, Jack chose the Caribbean Sea as his domain. He tied his piece of eight into his hair, letting it dangle over his trademark bandanna. Because of his position, it was possible that he kept in sporadic contact with his father. It is also known that during this time he had a sparrow tattooed on his arm to better identify himself to others as Captain Jack Sparrow.\n\nBut Jolly Roger also wanted Jack's position, and he invited him to a game of poker. Jolly had to cheat to win so he conspired with Amo Dorsi, a villainous Voodoo Witch Doctor, to deal the cards. Jolly won hand after hand. Soon, Jack was out of money and he bet his piece of eight for one, last hand. He won, and Jolly, thinking he'd been double-crossed, shot his partner in crime. Jack threw the table up, tossing cards and gold everywhere, and disappeared in the confusion. With his dying breath, Amo Dorsi cursed Jolly Roger to walk the earth as the undead, transforming him into a skeletal beast! Jolly swored vengeance against Sparrow and the Brethren Court, and became a leader of the undead legion.\n\nWith the Black Pearl under his command, Jack recruited a crew in Tortuga, including Hector Barbossa, whom Jack named his First Mate. The crew had many adventures in the time after this but nothing could amount to what happened next.\n\nWhen the evil alchemist, the Shadow Lord created a Shadow Gold, a special liquid that grants him unfathomable power, and threatened to destroy the Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court, Jack was sent by Tia Dalma on a mission to recover nine pieces of Shadow Gold in order to stop the Shadow Lord's supernatural Shadow Army. During his journey around the world, Jack went to Asia and Europe, fighting with powerful organizations like the East India Trading Company and bands of thieves like the Fourth Estate. With the help of the Pirate Lords, Jack was able to collect all pieces of Shadow Gold and defeat the Shadow Lord once and for all.\n\nAfter the Shadow Gold adventures, the treasure of Cortés would again play a part in Jack's pirate life, as he and the crew of the Black Pearl embarked upon a quest to find a cache of Aztec gold stashed by Cortés. However, before the treasure was found, the crew mutinied. Led by Barbossa, the crew marooned Jack on a desert island with nothing more than a flintlock pistol with a single shot. Barbossa believed it would be the last they would see of Jack Sparrow.\n\nHowever, Jack was in luck, as a group of rumrunners had currently been using the island as a secret cache, and for the next three days Jack cavorted with them, and likely suffered little more than a severe hangover before bartering passage off the island. This misadventure helped to build upon Jack's reputation in the Caribbean, helped along by Jack's outlandish exaggerations as to the circumstances of his escape; one version of events saw Sparrow using a couple of sea turtles as a raft to flee the island. Jack kept his single-shot pistol, making no modifications to it, but rather keeping it with the intent to use it upon his mutinous First Mate, Barbossa.\n\nIt was believed that Jack's altruistic nature may have been part of the reason why his crew mutinied; indeed, Barbossa would later note that Jack's attempts at non-violent solutions to problems was exactly the attitude that lost him the Black Pearl. Whatever the reason, the mutiny was not a unanimous agreement among the crew of the Black Pearl.\n\nDeath would not come quickly for any of the crew of the Pearl. After leaving Jack marooned, Barbossa's men found the Aztec gold, but their treasure, soon frittered away on drink and food and pleasurable company, came at a price. They became cursed men, where in the moonlight, they are shown for what they really are: walking neither alive nor dead, unable to live as normal men. William \"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner, for one, disagreed with Barbossa's decision to maroon Jack. But he too would suffer Barbossa's wrath, after sending his cursed coin to his son, believing that they deserved to be cursed and remain cursed. \"Bootstrap\" was tied to a cannon and plunged into the ocean depths, apparently to his death. Later, Barbossa and the crew of the Pearl learned that all 882 pieces of Cortés's treasure had to be returned and repaid in blood.\n\nJack was the only member of the crew not to be affected by the curse, since he had already been abandoned by the hands of Barbossa. However, he heard tales of the curse placed upon his former crewmen, which possibly fueled his desire to achieve immortality, and eternal freedom to sail the seas. Jack later bartered with rumrunners to gain passage off of Rumrunner's Isle.\n\nThe rumrunners transported Jack to the town of Port Royal. Upon his arrival, Jack was penniless and had no coin to his name. Determined to find a ship to captain, Jack was given advice by the local innkeeper who told him of local tax money being guarded around town by the city watch. Jack pilfered the money and bought himself a small sloop.\n\nJack took an entirely new crew, and he spent much of his time plundering merchantmen out of Jamaica. Though he was hardly the most infamous pirate on the Spanish Main, he did make a good name for himself in and around Port Royal, even going as far to find a local treasure of legend, belonging to none other than the local tavern keeper's late grandfather (the innkeeper urged Jack to find it and keep it for himself).\n\nHe caught the attention of local pirate hunter, Lieutenant Bligh after he completely drove an entire band of pirates out of their nest on the other side of the island. Jack became acquainted with a local ex-pirate named Sightless Sam who was once a comrade of Barbossa's, before he cut his eyes out. Jack agreed to transport his new friend to the backwash English shipyard port of Crooked Cove where he met Christopher Mings once again; he gladly continued \"work\" with his former employer. Jack was given an assignment to secure the King's treasure from the local fort for the brotherhood. After reconoitering around town, Jack went inland alone to take the gold, which he did without a problem. It was challenging Bligh's fleet that was difficult. With nothing but the light guns on the Timothy, Sparrow successfully defeated the four sloops that were sent to hunt the gold. Jack's ship was badly damaged from the fight, so Jack hiked to the other side of the island where he commandeered a twenty four gunned corvette called the Retribution, after convincing the local slaves to riot against their masters to serve as a diversion. It is presumed that Jack scuttled his old ship after complaining that \"the damned thing is too old and too slow for my tastes\" to Sightless Sam. Jack, his crew, and his new ship became the scourge of Jamaican waters until, by sheer coincidence, Jack Sparrow changed sides.\n\nThough he continued his acts of piracy, Jack Sparrow began to embark on quests for personal quests of wealth as well. In the late 1730's, the governor of Port Royal fell ill, and the only known remedy was Dogstounge which only grew on Dodo's Perch Island. In order to make some quick cash, Jack raced to the isle and found the plant. He took it to the governor who made Jack an honorable Privateer in his Navy. He also officially \"gave\" Jack the Retribution.\n\nJack became a favored agent of the governor, performing many tasks that other privateers and even mercenaries would not. This earned Jack a reputation in becoming the most famous privateer in the Caribbean! One such mission given to Captain Sparrow while he held a letter of marque came when he was sent to investigate recent entities being sighted in and around Crooked Cove. To his surprise, the attackers were cursed members of Barbossa's crew looking for the cursed medallions. Jack managed to drive away the buccaneers, but wished to look further into the curse of Cortés. His chance came when he came across a mysterious Aztec temple on a strange island. He encountered many perils while ascending to the palace's peak, including Barbossa's pirates. At the top, he found one of the cursed coins which he put in his pocket. The highlight of his career as a privateer came when he was sent to sack the town of Santo Domingo on Hispaniola. They didn't put up much of a fight, but Jack still managed to yield a large ransom as well as another cursed coin which he found in Aztec ruins outside of town. For his valiant services to the crown, Jack was given a new ship by the governor, a Galleon called the Mourning Star. His first exploit aboard his new ship was to steal a pirate treasure on Scurvy Beach. While on the island, he discovered a map leading to the shrouded Tum Boom Island. He embarked there at once, and while searching the jungles and caves, came across another cursed coin and more of the cursed crew.\n\nJack was given another task by the governor following his discovery, to escort him to Santo Domingo, the Spanish seat of power and the Caribbean. When he and the governor arrived, they found several assassins attempting to murder the official, but Jack dispatched them all. While they were conducting peace, the Spanish colony of Havana on the island of Cuba sent out a fleet of warships to conquer Port Royal (they were unaware of the recent peace). Determined to save Port Royal, Jack raced back on his ship and repelled the invasion force, taking the large sums of gold aboard the ships, as well as a large prize of money given to him by the governor. The governor was to return to England to make way for Weatherby Swann, so Jack resigned his commission and turned in his letters of marque. He would now worry on more personal matters such as finding his ship, the Black Pearl.\n\nJack now had a large ship and a crew to sail her, so he took advantage of this and embarked on a quest to find his beloved ship, the Black Pearl. He met two of Barbossa's ships off of Port Royal, but managed to blow the brigs to the bottom of the ocean. He heard tell that one of Barbossa's barques was coming in passed Port Royal in the middle of the night, so Jack went up to the lighthouse and drove the vessel onto the rocks. Onboard, he found the fractured bones of Barbossa's sailors as well as another cursed coin and his compass. Jack Sparrow now had everything he needed to find the Isla de Muerta.\n\nThe next morning, Jack set out with his men to find the island, and he came across the Pearl herself. Jack's ship was badly damaged in the fight, and many of his men were killed. Dismayed that the battle did not go in his favor, Jack returned to Tortuga aboard his sinking galleon to formulate another plan. He sold his wrecked ship, and waited for an idea.\n\nEight years have passed after the mutiny against him, Captain Jack Sparrow has become an infamous pirate of the Seven Seas, but he still wanted the Black Pearl as his own. Through unknown circumstances, Jack spent time with Anamaria before leaving her, in which he stole her boat, the Jolly Mon\u2014or, as the pirate himself put it, \"borrowed without permission, but with every intention of bringing it back\". With his new boat, Jack Sparrow was free to sail the seas, ultimately ending up at Shipwreck City.\n\nAt some point, Jack Sparrow traded Scarlett and Giselle fair and square to the Auctioneer, who wanted brides to sell. The auction took place on the very night where both wenches, separately, believed they were to marry Jack Sparrow. By the time they learn of Jack's deceit, the auction started and Jack sailed away on the Jolly Mon. Jack's trickery caused a great deal of trouble for the Auctioneer and his clients, particularly Mungard. Before Jack Sparrow left Shipwreck City, Scarlett would have already taken four nails off of the Jolly Mon, just in case Jack had cold feet about their supposed wedding. This caused the boat to leak in a few areas, which forced Jack to make the nearest port so he could find a ship more suitable to continue his quest.\n\nThe Jolly Mon plowed towards Port Royal, while Jack stood on the rigging, gazing keen-eyed at the harbor. Noticing that his boat was filling up with water, he jumped down to bail it out. Jack then spotted skeletal remains of three pirates, still clad in buccaneer rags, hanging from gallows erected from a rocky promontory along with a fourth unoccupied gallows bearing a sign that said \"Pirates Ye Be Warned\". Pausing, Jack Sparrow took off his hat and placed it above his heart\u2014a moment of exaggerated respect for the doomed pirates as he sailed by them. As Jack reached the port, his boat kept sinking lower and lower until he made it to the docks, where only the mast was visible above water. Jack offered the harbormaster three shillings to ensure his name did not appear on the ledger. The Harbormaster accepted this bribe, though did not notice Jack stealing his purse before the pirate swaggered away to find a suitable ship for him to sail on.\n\nStriding through the docks to \"commandeer\" the Interceptor, Jack Sparrow was accosted by two royal marines, Mullroy and Murtogg, who were assigned to guard the Interceptor and make sure the docks stay off limits to civilians. The two marines and Jack soon engage in idle conversation before they were interrupted by a young lady falling from Fort Charles. Despite his piratical nature, Jack was not about to let the girl, Elizabeth Swann, drown, and dived into the ocean to rescue her. Bringing her up to the harbor, Jack tore off her corset, allowing her to breathe; he then spied a strange coin fastened around her neck, one of the pieces of Aztec gold Barbossa's men were seeking. However, before he could explore the situation further, Commodore James Norrington arrived to arrest Sparrow.\n\nDespite having saved Governor Weatherby Swann's daughter, Elizabeth Swann, Commodore Norrington saw Jack's mark from the East India Trading Company. The Governor then ordered Jack to be hanged. However, Jack held Elizabeth hostage, ensuring the return of his effects before making his daring escape. With Norrington's men in pursuit, Jack sought refuge in a blacksmith's shop, where he cut his manacles. However, he was soon confronted by the blacksmith's apprentice, William Turner, whose face Sparrow vaguely recognized, who engaged the pirate in a sword fight. Sparrow won, through a mixture of skill and pirate trickery, but Turner refused to stand down. Jack was resolute he would not shoot Turner, thus wasting his single shot, and was preoccupied enough with this quandary for John Brown to knock him unconscious.\n\nWhen Sparrow came to, he found himself incarcerated in Fort Charles, which soon came under attack by a fog-shrouded pirate ship, the Black Pearl, as Jack immediately identified it. During the fight, as Jack was luring the Prison Dog to him, the pirate Koehler happened upon Jack's cell, and inadvertently revealed to Jack the existence of the curse of Cortés upon Barbossa's men. Jack remained in the cell throughout the attack, but, the next morning, was visited again; this time by Will Turner, who made a deal with Jack to help him reach the Black Pearl's port and rescue the captive Elizabeth. Jack agreed, and immediately set about acquiring a ship.\n\nAfter escaping the prison, Jack Sparrow and Will Turner planned to commandeer the Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Dauntless, in order to commandeer Norrington's faster ship, the Interceptor. Sparrow and Turner used cunning and guile to board and commandeer the Dauntless, which was summarily boarded by Norrington's men. However, the pirates slipped away, unnoticed, and boarded the Interceptor. They then used it to flee Port Royal and leaving the Dauntless with its rudder chain disabled. The two pirates headed for Tortuga to find a crew for the Interceptor, for they can't crew one ship on their own.\n\nAfter arriving to Tortuga, and some less-than pleasant reunions with two jealous prostitutes, Scarlett and Giselle, Jack tracked down his old friend, Joshamee Gibbs. Jack explained to Gibbs his plan to follow the Black Pearl's trail to Isla de Muerta, and to use Will as leverage to reacquire the Pearl from Barbossa. Gibbs agreed to the plan and helped Jack assemble a crew. After an interesting reunion with Anamaria, Jack and his new crew set sail on the Interceptor, following Jack's navigation by his strange compass to Isla de Muerta.\n\nAt some point during the journey, the Interceptor encountered the British merchant vessel Earl King, captained by McGlue. Jack and Will disguised as Royal Navy officers and boarded the King, but Captain McGlue realized that they're pirates. The crew of the Interceptor boarded the King, captured the entire crew, and looted the ship.\n\nThanks to the Interceptor's speed, the crew arrived at Isla de Muerta just after the Black Pearl, and Jack and Will went ashore. There, Jack witnessed the start of the ritual that Barbossa hoped would lift the curse, but complications arose in the shape of Will, who was far too impatient for Jack's liking. Jack implored Will to remain where he was so that Jack could implement his plan, but Will rashly knocked Jack unconscious and rescued Elizabeth himself. Turner took the girl back to the Interceptor, where he admitted Jack had fallen behind. Having sworn to keep to the Pirate's Code, Gibbs ordered the crew to set sail.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack had woken up, and found himself surrounded by Barbossa's pirates. Invoking the right of parley, Jack was brought before Barbossa, and made a deal with him to procure the person whose blood would lift their curse, for Elizabeth's blood had had no effect. Jack was brought along as the pirates set sail to pursue the Interceptor, and found himself aboard his former ship for the first time in eight years.\n\nIn the captain's cabin of the Black Pearl, Jack and Barbossa were negotiating about how and when Jack will reveal the name of the person's blood that Barbossa needs. To Jack's dismay, the Bo'sun of the Pearl came in and told Barbossa that they were close to the Interceptor. However, when he suggested to Barbossa that he attempt a negotiation with the Interceptor's' crew, Jack was locked in the brig. As Barbossa said, that was the kind of attitude that had lost Sparrow the Pearl in the first place.\n\nJack witnessed the ensuing battle from within his cell, but when a stray shot smashed the lock, he was able to return to the deck, and slyly helped his crew in the fight. Noticing Barbossa's monkey making off with the medallion, Jack gave chase, and once more found himself face-to-face with Barbossa aboard the Pearl. This time, Barbossa was not so lenient, and made Jack walk the plank. Accompanied by Elizabeth, Sparrow had no choice but to make for Rumrunner's Isle, the island he had been marooned on ten years earlier. Fortunately, Barbossa allowed Jack to keep his pistol, still with its single shot.\n\nWith the rumrunners no longer operational, Jack had no plan of escape. Elizabeth then questioned Jack and his legends, after being told about the last escape. Jack then responded by giving her rum. However, Elizabeth proved more cunning than Jack had expected. After getting him drunk and passed out, after singing \"A Pirate's Life for Me\", she proceeded to burn the rum caché. It was through the smoke signal that she hoped the ensuing fire would attract attention to the Royal Navy. Jack rubbished the plan, tempted to even shoot Elizabeth had he possessed more than one shot. But a short time later, help did indeed arrive in the form of the Dauntless, and both Jack and Elizabeth were rescued. This caused Jack to comment that Elizabeth would be impossible to live with.\n\nOn board, Jack and Elizabeth persuaded Commodore Norrington to set after the Black Pearl and rescue Will, though yet again Jack had his own agenda. He coerced Norrington into allowing him to go ashore alone, and Jack once again confronted Barbossa in the treasure cave, just as the ritual began for a second time, this time with Will as the sacrifice. Jack stalled the proceedings and was able to convince \"Commodore\" Barbossa and the cursed crew to defeat Norrington before lifting their curse. During their negotiations, Jack managed to secretly steal one of the cursed coins from the stone chest. Barbossa sent all but a few of his men to attack the Royal Navy forces outside, while he, Jack and Will remained in the cave. It was at this point that Jack showed his true colors.\n\nStealing a sword from one of Barbossa's men, Jack threw the blade to Will, who fought Barbossa's men. At the same time, Jack pulled his sword out and engaged his former First Mate in a deadly duel, in which Barbossa seemed to gain the upper hand. The fight led them around the cave, until Barbossa cut it short by declaring that, as an immortal, Jack could not kill him. Sparrow tried anyway, but Barbossa merely sighed at the sword plunged into his body, and responded in kind, stabbing Jack in the gut. Victory was denied, however, when Jack stumbled backwards into a shaft of moonlight, transforming into a skeleton before Barbossa's shocked eyes. Holding aloft the medallion he had taken, Jack grinned triumphantly at his nemesis, and began the duel anew.\n\nThe duel seemed endless, although quite pointless, since both captains were immortal. When asked if they were to engage in this single duel until Judgement Day, Jack suggested that Barbossa could surrender. By this time, Elizabeth had joined Will in the cave, and, working together, they had dispatched the remaining cursed pirates. Noticing Will standing over the chest, Jack quickly cut his hand with his sword, staining his medallion with his blood and hurling it to Will, who did the same with his coin. Will dropped both coins into the chest, and Jack finally used his single shot, firing it into Barbossa's heart. Barbossa realized he had been defeated before toppling backwards, dead.\n\nAvenged and the curse now lifted from him, Jack set about searching through the treasure cave for items of particular value. However, upon his return to the open water, he discovered his crew had already departed on the Black Pearl, after Elizabeth had failed to convince them to stay and help in the fight. Jack had no choice but to accompany the Royal Navy back to Port Royal.\n\nArriving to Port Royal, Jack was sentenced to be executed at the gallows, for his crimes, to be hanged. He grimly awaited his fate in the courtyard of Fort Charles. However, Will Turner was also present, and staged a daring rescue of his comrade. Together, the two pirates fought Commodore Norrington's soldiers, but were ultimately surrounded by Royal Navy soldiers, Norrington, and Governor Swann. It was only when Elizabeth interference and decision to stand with them that Governor Swann ordered the soldiers to stand down and lower their weapons.\n\nSeizing his chance, and noticing a familiar parrot flying nearby, Jack Sparrow made his farewells and escape. Bragging to the soldiers, he accidentally toppled over the fort wall, falling into the harbor. Landing with a splash, Jack sputtered to the surface and gazed at the horizon. With a smile, his eyes landed on a familiar sight\u2014the Black Pearl. Her black sails were no longer tattered and her sides gleamed in the bright sun. Grinning, Jack began to swim for it. In the face of this alarming chain of events, culminating in Elizabeth's profession of love for Will, Commodore Norrington decided not to immediately pursue Sparrow, giving him a day's head start to escape.\n\nAs Jack arrived close enough to be pulled in, he was brought aboard the Pearl. After regaining his hat and coat, he was once more given command of his ship by Anamaria. He ordered the new crew of the Black Pearl to set sail and, with his compass, headed off on many other adventures on the high seas.\n\nAs captain of the Black Pearl once again, Jack continued operating as a pirate. The Black Pearl attacked the merchant ship which was carrying the St. Piran's Blade, a sword with supposedly magical powers. However, Mr. Cotton accidentally sent the ship to the bottom of the sea. Now in need of help, Jack summoned Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann for a meeting in the Faithful Bride tavern in Tortuga. Jack told them about the blade, but the meeting was interrupted by Jack's former crew which became undead once again. Will and Elizabeth were captured but Jack managed to escape.\n\nThe cursed pirates forced Will and Elizabeth onto their ship and took them to their secret hideout. They also retrieved the treasure from the ship Jack sank, including the St. Piran's Blade. The cursed pirates waited for the Black Pearl to arrive so they could send her to the bottom of the ocean. But instead, Jack sneaked into the fort and freed Will and Elizabeth. Jack fought against the cursed pirates with St. Piran's Blade, but when Elizabeth took it, the sword started glowing with fire, because she was the only person with the heart pure enough to activate the sword's power. The cursed pirates were easily defeated and their ship was heavily damaged by the cannon fore from the Pearl. After the battle, Will and Elizabeth persuaded Jack to give them the magical blade so they could donate it to some museum. However, Jack kept the sword's chest which was filled with jewels.\n\nWhen Jack went to search for one treasure which he buried before Barbossa's mutiny, he couldn't find the exact spot. To find the treasure, he had to find one of his former crewmembers, Scurvy Joe, who had the treasure map tattooed on his back. When Sparrow found out that Joe was imprisoned in Port Royal, he \"invaded\" the city alone. He was quickly captured and thrown into the dungeon. When he was confronted by Commodore Norrington, the naval officer commented that Jack really is the worst pirate that he ever heard of. However, Jack quickly escaped, with the secret help of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. When Joe tried to kill him, Jack easily captured him, and the Black Pearl' sailed to an island where the treasure was buried. Two days later, when dawn came, the sun turned the cursed pirate into his human form, allowing Jack to see the treasure map.\n\nWhen Jack learned about the mystical magical idol of Aztec origin, he sailed the Black Pearl for Mexico, where the idol was supposed to be hidden. The information was correct, the idol was hidden in one old temple, but once he reached the temple, Jack saw his old crew, now led by Bo'sun, forcing Will to take the idol for them, because they were holding Elizabeth as a hostage.\n\nHowever, when Bo'sun took the idol from Will, Jack attacked him, pushed him into a deep pit, and took the idol. Will and Elizabeth disposed of Pintel and Ragetti, and the trio started escaping from the temple. Followed by angry pirates, the trio reached the beach and boarded the Black Pearl, which opened fire on the undead crew's ship, damaging it heavily. However, Jack knew that his former crew would follow the idol wherever he goes, so he decided to melt the idol and spend the gold in as many ports as possible.\n\nSome time later, Jack was in Tortuga once again, where he found himself chased by Norrington and his men, who were disguised in civilian clothes. Cornered in one alley, Jack had no way out, but luckily for him, Anamaria showed up, interrupting Norrington's men, and Sparrow managed to run away. He found the carriage belonging to the Governor of Tortuga, from which he took the governor's hat and cloak, easily disguising himself. When Norrington and his men encountered \"the governor\", he threatened to arrest them as spies. Unfortunately for Jack, the real governor suddenly appeared, and Jack had to run away again. Using the governor's coach, Jack managed to escape once again, and he and Anamaria reached the harbor where they boarded a boat which took them far away from Norrington.\n\nSome time later, Jack and Will Turner ended on the Isle of Lusee, a place where the cruel governor treated the colonists as if he owned them, imprisoning the innocents and confiscating their treasure. Jack and Will convinced the people of the island to organize a revolution and overthrow the governor. The people of the island, led by Jack and Will, stormed the governor's fort and Jack easily captured him, taking the keys of the treasury. However, when he and Will entered the treasury, Jack revealed that his plan was to steal the treasure for himself, not to give it to its rightful owners. However, Will convinced Jack not to steal the treasure, and because the people of the island considered him their hero, they gave him the largest share of the treasure.\n\nA year after his great escape from Port Royal, Jack realized his freedom came at a cost. The debt he had sworn to Davy Jones thirteen years prior had still not been paid. Whether Jack had the foresight to attempt to call off the debt, or whether it was simply a coincidence is unknown, but Jack embarked on a quest to locate the Dead Man's Chest, which legends say contained the still-beating heart of Davy Jones. But first, Jack allowed himself to be captured by the corsairs off the Canary Islands and taken to the Turkish prison in order to obtain information he needs to solve his impending dilemma.\n\nHe soon happened upon a valuable drawing of a key in a Turkish prison, giving him an advantage in his quest by figuring out that he must find the key itself. Jack was able to obtain this drawing, but soon encountered trouble, and fled the island within the confines of a coffin launched out to sea. In the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Jack used the coffin as a makeshift boat to return to the Black Pearl, where he informed his crew of his new venture. Confused, mostly because of Jack not telling exactly what to look for, the crew of the Black Pearl agreed to sail off to search for the key and what the key might unlock.\n\nThat night, Jack was visited in the Pearl's cellar by Bootstrap Bill Turner, currently serving as part of Davy Jones' crew aboard the Flying Dutchman. Turner informed Jack that his time was up, and Jones was calling in his debt. To reinforce this, Turner branded Jack with the Black Spot, setting fear into Jack's heart and causing him to begin his quest for the key with all haste. He was so fearful of what his debt might entail, when he lost his hat, he told his crew to leave it. It was through this fear that Jack could not bring himself even to tell his crew what forces pursued them.\n\nJack knew that as long as he remained on the open seas, he was in danger, so the Pearl weighed anchor at Isla de Pelegostos, the closest body of land, and one which Jack was likely familiar with. Even here, the crew of the Pearl was not safe, as they were summarily captured by a group of cannibalistic natives. Jack was made the chief of the tribe (allowed to retain his position so long as he acted like a chief), although he found his fortunes had little improved when he learned that the natives believed him to be a god, and he would be eaten to release his spirit from its \"fleshy prison\". Despite this, Jack played along, all the while looking for means of escape. Meanwhile, some of his crew had already been eaten, and the rest held in cages made from the bones of their former companions.\n\nJack's situation improved with the arrival of William Turner, seeking Jack in order to obtain his compass for Lord Cutler Beckett. Will inadvertently caused a distraction, through his capture by and subsequent escape from the cannibals, which gave Jack the time he needed to flee. Jack, Will and the surviving crew returned to the Black Pearl and set sail, though Jack still refused to head into open water. Instead, he had unfinished business near Pelegosto, in the Pantano River on the island of Cuba.\n\nThe crew traveled through upriver in boats to the shack of Tia Dalma, where Jack hoped to find information on the key to the chest which contained Davy Jones's heart. He and Dalma had a history, and as Jack himself said, they had, at one time, been inseparable. It was also implied that the two had once been lovers.\n\nUpon arrival at her shack, however, Jack was somewhat perturbed to find Dalma took more interest in Will than himself. However, Jack was able to trade Barbossa's undead monkey in exchange for information on the the location of the key, and details about Jones's heart. He was also given a jar of dirt, as Tia said that Davy Jones could not make port but one day for every ten years, and so Jack would bring land, in some form, with him.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, the crew set out to find Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman. Will was summarily captured by Jones' crew after Jack told him to say \"Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt\", and Davy Jones himself confronted Jack aboard the Black Pearl. He demanded Jack's debt be paid, but Jack tried to convince Jones otherwise, because of Barbossa's mutiny that happened two years after becoming captain of the Pearl. But Jones pointed out that because Jack had introduced himself as \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow throughout the years, he was still captain, even though he was not on the Pearl itself. After a series of bargains, Jones agreed that, should Jack bring him one hundred souls in three days, he would be free. As slim a chance as this was, Jack took it and Jones sealed the deal by removing the Black Spot. Jack then had the Pearl's crew immediately set sail for Tortuga, noting that Jones did not specify what state the souls should be in.\n\nAfter arriving to Tortuga, Jack and Gibbs began recruiting crewmen for service on the Pearl in the Twelve Daggers tavern. They managed to enlist a total of four mariners before a bar brawl broke out, started by the disgraced former Commodore, James Norrington. Jack and Gibbs managed to slip out, and began preparing the Black Pearl for launch.\n\nAt this point, Jack encountered Elizabeth Swann, having escaped from the custody of Lord Beckett to find Will. Jack realized Elizabeth's true desire was being reunited with Will, and knew he could use this to his advantage. He persuaded Elizabeth that finding the Dead Man's Chest would help her save Will. Thus, ensuring that when she used Jack's compass, it would point to her true desire, in order to save Will, the chest. Jack finally found a heading.\n\nThe Black Pearl immediately set course for Isla Cruces, the burial site of the Dead Man's Chest. On board the Pearl, Jack and Gibbs learned of Will's association with Lord Cutler Beckett, after finding out about the Letters of Marque from Elizabeth. It was there that they realized that the only reason Beckett wanted Jack's compass so that he could find the Dead Man's Chest. Jack took the documents, much to Elizabeth's annoyance, and refused to return them unless she could sufficiently \"persuade\" him to do so. Elizabeth attempted to persuade him, but Jack was immune.\n\nLater on during the journey, Jack once more approached Elizabeth, while being depressed about not being married already. Jack offered her a drink and a marriage with him, as captain of a ship. Disgusted, Elizabeth turned down his offer of marriage. Jack then questioned her answer, stating that she would come over to his side in time. He stated that Elizabeth was curious and longed to feel the freedom and the life Jack enjoyed. In turn, Elizabeth told him she was sure one day Jack would prove himself to be a good man, and he would long for the reward of fame that would follow. Jack was indeed enticed by this, but whatever attraction may have developed between the two was soon quashed when Jack noticed the Black Spot had reappeared on his palm. At that moment, Gibbs sighted land: Isla Cruces, and the end of Jack's quest.\n\nUpon arrival at Isla Cruces, Jack set about tracking down the Dead Man's Chest, using Elizabeth as his guide. Jack had Norrington dig at the supposed burial site, as deigned by Elizabeth, using the compass. Her reading was correct, and Norrington soon unearthed the chest. However, before Jack could open it, Will Turner arrived, having escaped from servitude aboard the Flying Dutchman. He refused to let Jack open the chest, wanting to stab the heart within and thus free his father from his debt to Jones. Jack, naturally, wanted the heart for himself, in order to call off Jones' Kraken, and drew his sword. It was a standoff, exacerbated by Norrington's intervention, who wanted control of the heart for his own personal reasons.\n\nA three-way sword fight inevitably ensued, in which Jack attempted desperately to get his hands on the key. The three-way duel progressed atop a stone church, where Jack finally got a hold of the key, but was disarmed in the attempt. Norrington then stated, with his blade pointed towards Jack, his intention to kill Jack for ruining his life. Jack however deflected the blame onto Will's shoulders, and then fled through the graveyard with the key. However, he was soon thrust back into the battle when the two duelists dislodged an old water wheel, and continued the fight inside and around it as it rolled through the jungle.\n\nUltimately, however, Jack managed to hold on to the key, and opened the Dead Man's Chest after taking it from the pirate Hadras. Within was Davy Jones' heart, just as Tia Dalma had said, which Jack hid inside his jar of dirt back at the longboat on the beach. Davy Jones' crew soon caught up, and Jack became too preoccupied with fighting them off to notice Norrington studying the jar with great interest.\n\nJack's companions were able to hold the pirates back, and fled in the longboat leaving Norrington, who instead fled into the jungle carrying the empty chest, thus distracting the pirates. Jack made it back to the Black Pearl, which launched for the open water, safe in the knowledge that he was now in possession of the heart of Davy Jones.\n\nAs Jack had expected, the Flying Dutchman soon caught up with the Pearl, and he began taunting its Captain, holding his jar of dirt aloft. Jones chased the pearl at first firing at it but the Pearl soon outran the Flying Dutchman. That's when Davy Jones called upon the Kraken once more, which began its assault on the Black Pearl. Shaking the vessel, the Kraken dislodged Jack's Jar of Dirt, which smashed on the deck, revealing nothing inside but a pile of dirt. Desperately searching for the missing heart, which was already making its way to Cutler Beckett in the possession of Norrington, Jack realized his advantage over Jones was lost. True to his usual form, Jack turned tail and fled in the ship's lone remaining boat, seeking to escape back to the relative safety of Isla Cruces.\n\nHowever, despite all evidence to the contrary, Jack was indeed a good man at heart who knew he could not leave his crew to die in the attack, and began rowing back to his beloved Black Pearl.\n\nHe arrived back on deck in time to ignite a gunpowder trap set up by Will that wounded the Kraken and forestalled its attack for a moment. Jack ordered his crew into the longboat, at the cost of his ship. Gibbs was shocked at Jack's decision, but the Captain had seen sense; after all, she was only a ship.\n\nAs the crew raced onto the longboat, Elizabeth thanked Jack for coming back to save them, and leaned in for a kiss. Their kiss carried them to the mast, to which Elizabeth suddenly chained Jack. She had realized the Kraken was after Jack alone, not the rest of the crew, and this sacrifice would be the only way to ensure their survival. Jack conceded her trickery with a smile, calling her a \"pirate\". Apparently resigned to his fate, Jack watched her leave the ship.\n\nAs soon as he was left alone on deck, Jack frantically tried to escape his chains. He managed to slip out of his manacles, with the aid of oil from a broken lantern, though he was too late. No sooner had he freed himself that the Kraken returned, its fanged mouth rising up to deck-level. The Kraken belched out a roar, spraying Jack with slime and spitting out Jack's hat, eaten prior to Jack's arrival at Pelegosto.\n\nPlacing his hat once more atop his head, Captain Jack Sparrow said \"Hello beastie\". Then he drew his sword and faced off against the Kraken as it dragged the Black Pearl under water.\n\nWith that, the captain went down with his ship, and Davy Jones considered his debt settled. Jack's captain-less crew returned, dejected and defeated, back to Tia Dalma's shack. There, they raised a toast to the late Captain Jack Sparrow, but Tia had not yet given up hope. She stated that there was a chance to bring Jack back from the depths of World's End, though it would entail a journey to Davy Jones' Locker. The crew agreed, and set out under the command of their new captain, the resurrected Hector Barbossa, a man who knew those waters well.\n\nJack was taken by the Kraken to Davy Jones' Locker, where he was forced to endure the worst punishment he could ever take; his beloved Pearl was stuck on a seemingly-endless desert, while Jack himself was tormented by a series of hallucinations that personified the various aspects of his personality as members of his crew, torturing both his love of the sea and his idea of being the only \"Jack Sparrow\". Divided in this manner, Jack had no hope of moving his ship, as though his crew did follow orders, the flaws of his \"crew\" made the Pearl unable to make any sort of progression with no wind to move the ship.\n\nWhen Tia Dalma neared the island where Jack was stranded, she enchanted the rocks on the island to teleport to the Black Pearl, and the rocks cracked open, revealing an army of rock-crabs. The rock-crabs used their combined strength to move the Black Pearl. Jack was off the ship at the moment, but was able to run and catch up to the Pearl and boarded it in time to sail it out to sea.\n\nBy this point, his former crew, led by a resurrected Barbossa and aided by Tai Huang and the crew of the Hai Peng, arrived in the Locker, ostensibly to free Jack. Sparrow initially believed them to be mere hallucinations, and greeted them with mockery but was swayed when he saw Elizabeth, perhaps recalling the foul memory of his death, or maybe just recalling her kiss. Jack remained unfazed by their appearance, and even greeted his former nemesis, Barbossa, with cheer, knowing full well that their only means of escape, the Pearl, was in Jack's possession. However, he was forced to concede that Barbossa, holding the navigational charts bestowed upon the crew by Sao Feng, would be useful in the escape, as in the locker, his compass didn't seem to work.\n\nAlmost immediately, a rivalry formed between Jack and Barbossa with both claiming to be the rightful captain of the Black Pearl. The crew boarded the Pearl and set sail on the endless seas of Davy Jones' Locker, meeting Elizabeth's father, Weatherby Swann, along the way.\n\nThe crew continued to sail through endless seas of Davy Jones' Locker, knowing that if they were unable to escape by sunset, they would remain trapped in that dimension forever. Jack, however, was able to decipher one additional phrase, \"Up is Down\". Puzzled at first, after listening to his shoulder angel and devil debate his future (ironically they look just like Jack) he figured out the meaning, and coerced his crew into rocking the ship back and forth. Barbossa, realizing Jack had figured out the chart loosed the objects below deck, until at last the Pearl tipped upside down under the waves. As the sun sank below the horizon, the ship returned to the world of the living at sunrise; the ship had literally been turned upside down to pass between dimensions, going from the bottom of the sea, and floating all the way to the top.\n\nAs soon as the crew emerged from the Locker, Barbossa pulled his pistol on Jack, leading to a tense stand-off. Barbossa wanted to lead Jack to Shipwreck Cove as he was a pirate, but Jack adamantly wished to leave the pirates to their fate. This turned even Elizabeth and Will against Jack, but determined not to return to the locker, Jack pulled his pistol on Barbossa. Then it was revealed that none of the crews' pistols would work due to the wet powder of just passing through the sea. Jack and Barbossa were forced to grudgingly cooperate, and made for the nearest island to find fresh water.\n\nThe island the crew happened upon was the one on which the corpse of the Kraken had been left, after Davy Jones had been forced to kill it by Lord Beckett. Jack had a moment of sympathy for the creature, perhaps seeing the reflection of his own mortality in its dead eye. Jack voiced his fear of death to Barbossa, who reminded him that death, not immortality, was the only certainty. It was at this point that Jack decided to redouble his efforts to discover a way of achieving eternal life. In another turning point, Jack, who originally planned on simply running and becoming the last pirate as the EITC killed them all, finally realized that Beckett had to be stopped, and agreed to meet with the other members of the Brethren Court.\n\nHowever, his quest was postponed by the arrival of the Empress, and the betrayal of Sao Feng. Jack and his crew were confronted by Sao Feng, who punched Jack on the nose in retaliation for a \"great insult\" paid by Jack at some point in the past. Jack was forced to give up the Black Pearl when it transpired that \"Captain\" Turner had struck a deal with Feng to take the ship for himself, in order to catch the Flying Dutchman and free his father from servitude. Jack then, realizing that his rescue was a scam, asked the crew if anyone had actually missed him. Four members did: Marty, Pintel, Ragetti and Jack the Monkey.\n\nJack was then taken aboard the HMS Endeavour, flagship of Lord Cutler Beckett, where his diminished position did nothing to dampen his creativity at negotiation. He struck his own deal, promising to lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove, and thus deliver the Brethren Court into his clutches, in exchange for Jack's freedom from both the company and from Davy Jones. Beckett, however, threatened to kill Jack to \"Cut out the middle man\", but Jack promised he would send the Brethren out to him, to ensure their battle. Beckett agreed, as long as Sparrow could accomplish that feat.\n\nTheir final negotiations were cut short through Barbossa and Feng's agreeing upon a common enemy, resulting in the Pearl's attack on the Endeavour. Jack hastily shook on a deal, then escaped the flagship and returned to his own vessel via a cannon and rope, to find Elizabeth had been given over to Feng in order for Barbossa to retain the Pearl. He ordered Will Turner to be sent to the brig and had the Pearl set sail to Shipwreck Cove.\n\nBy this point, Jack found himself unable to trust Will Turner, as he escaped the brig to attempt to help Jack honor his bargain with Beckett by leaving a trail for Beckett to follow. Jack, in realizing how far apart Will and Elizabeth were growing, conceived an elaborate plan where both he and Will could get what they both want. Jack's plan was that he would stab the heart of Davy Jones, thereby making him immortal, ensuring his father's freedom, and Will could still be with Elizabeth. Jack then gave Will his compass, set him overboard while sending his regards to Davy Jones, and then continued on to meeting the Brethren at the Cove.\n\nArriving at Shipwreck Island, Jack commented on the lack of originality for pirates naming things, such as Larry, a geezer he once sailed with. He also witnessed Tia Dalma being sent below deck, to the Pearl's brig, perhaps while overhearing her conversation with Barbossa. When gazing at Shipwreck Cove upon arrival, Barbossa and the crew commented on how many ships are at the Cove, in which Jack realized that he owed them all money. Jack, Barbossa, and the rest of the Pearl's crewmen carried on to the meeting at Pirate Hall.\n\nDuring the meeting of the Fourth Brethren Court, Jack found himself at odds with Barbossa, and attempted to convince the Pirate Lords to unite against the East India Trading Company. Whether this was playing them into the hands of Beckett or just pure logic, one can never guess. Jack skillfully used his extensive knowledge of surviving saying they could hold up within, but it would be devastating for morale, and half of them could die. He also mentioned that they could also released Calypso, as Barbossa petitioned, but Jack thought that to be too risky. Thus, he agreed with Elizabeth, who had finally joined them as the new Pirate Lord of the South China Sea. That they must fight.\n\nEveryone agreed to this plan, at least until Barbossa mentioned that the Code specifically mentioned that only the Pirate King can declare war. Jack thought this to be made up, until Barbossa called upon  Captain Teague, Jack's father to consult the Pirata Codex. When a vote had to be made for the next King, Jack voted for Elizabeth, knowing she would support the decision to go to war. After the meeting, Jack went to confront his father. In the reunion, Teague offered Jack advice, concerning his search for immortality, \"It's not just about living forever, Jackie. The trick is living with yourself forever.\" Jack then inquired about his mother, to which Teague responded by holding aloft her shrunken, severed head. Jack responded uncomfortably that she looked great. After which, Teague gave the head to Jack for him to keep, and Jack kept it on his belt.\n\nWith the meeting adjourned and the Pirate Lords decided upon their course of action, the fleet sailed out to meet the armada of the East India Company, the Black Pearl at its head. When the pirates saw Cutler Beckett's armada and how many ships they were going against, they all turned angrily towards Jack, and sheepishly Jack called for the forces to parlay. During the parlay, he was traded for Will, who had been recovered by Beckett in order that his debt to Davy Jones would once again, be settled. Due to his escape, the debt had technically been reset. So 100 years aboard the Dutchman were once again required. Because his plan was working, Jack was unconcerned with being sent to the Dutchman, though slightly put off by Jones.\n\nJack was sent to the brig on board the Flying Dutchman, where he again experienced hallucinations. Jack weakly told them to go away, but they insisted that they couldn't go back to the locker without him. Then he saw a hallucination of what he might be like as a Dutchman crewman, and one of his other hallucinations commented that defeating Jones would put an alternative far out of reach. Jack though was adamant, and decided to escape and steal the Dead Man's Chest. After thinking like Will, Jack fled the brig in the same manner Will had released Jack from Fort Charles over a year before. He was then able to snatch the chest out from under the noses of its guards, Mullroy and Murtogg in addition to recovering his effects. However, he was accosted by Davy Jones during his escape, thereby forcing Sparrow to \"fly\" up into the Flying Dutchman's rigging. There, a fierce and ferocious duel ensued between the two captains as the Flying Dutchman and the Black Pearl engaged in battle around a maelstrom conjured by Calypso.\n\nAt first, Jack seemed to have the upper hand, slicing off Jones' tentacle that held the Key to the Dead Man's Chest, and disarming him. However, Jones broke Jack's sword, and then took the chest from Jack, sending him flying onto a rope. Swinging on the rope, Jack shot the chest from Jones' grip, sending it falling to the deck. The two engaged in a race to reach the chest whilst continuing their duel. Jack ultimately managed to get the key to open the chest and held his broken sword over the heart.\n\nAfter Jones asked Will Turner his routine question: \"Do you fear death?\", Jack taunted him by asking if Jones himself feared death. However, Jack was plunged into a quandary when Jones stabbed Will Turner, leaving him to die. Jack knew that the only way to save his old friend and opponent would be to allow him to stab the heart, thus ensuring Will immortality, though at the cost of Jack's own chance at the same. As Bootstrap Bill Turner snapped out of his delirium and engaged Jones, Jack fought with himself, struggling between his own dream of immortality and his one chance to save Will.\n\nIn the end, Jack's altruistic nature won over, and Jack forfeited his immortality. He placed his broken sword in Will Turner's dying hand, guiding it to stab the heart, killing Jones in the process. As the Dutchman's crewmen were coming towards them, Jack was forced to drag the frantic Elizabeth away from Will's body, knowing that they only had moments until the Dutchman was swallowed up in the maelstrom. While Will's heart was carved out by Bootstrap Bill, Jack rigged a makeshift parachute and fled with the distraught Elizabeth back to the Black Pearl with the other pirates.\n\nArriving onboard the Black Pearl, the rest of his crew wanted to flee the field as the ship was damaged and the the Endeavour was now coming upon them. Jack though, perhaps now determined to finish Beckett off, and salvage the cause of Piracy due to losing his shot at immortality, declined. And when the Flying Dutchman burst from the sea, now captained by Will Turner, Jack knew they now had a fighting chance, and quickly readied the ship to turn on Beckett. Together, the flagship of piracy and the ship of supernatural power turned on the Endeavor, dealing a devastating dual broadside on the symbol of British Power. Lord Beckett was killed in the devastation, after which the East India Trading Company Armada fled the battle.\n\nWith the battle won, Jack bade farewell to Elizabeth, who had to be with Will before he leaves to do his duty to ferry souls. He then sailed the Black Pearl to Tortuga, where he was found in the company of Scarlett and Giselle, persuading them with an offer to ride aboard his ship. However, upon returning to the harbor, Jack found the Pearl gone: Barbossa had mutinied once again by taking the Pearl, marooning him and Joshamee Gibbs ashore. This didn't seem to faze Jack, however, who resorted to using a dinghy left to him. Scarlett and Giselle slapped Jack, after Jack confessed many things to them, which resulted in Gibbs being slapped by Jack.\n\nAs Gibbs remained in Tortuga, in the company of Scarlett and Giselle, Jack sails away on his dinghy. Jack had anticipated Barbossa's treachery, and had cut out the middle part of Sao Feng's navigational charts for himself. He was running up his pirate flag, while singing \"A Pirate's Life for Me\", in his dinghy. Looking at Sao Feng's charts, he discovered that the location of the Fountain of Youth is in Florida, as the legends foretold. Using his compass, he located a bottle of rum and began his search for the Fountain of Youth. Jack then sailed off in his dinghy, while sipping the rum, as he began his journey to achieve immortality.\n\nEven with the help of his map and compass, Jack Sparrow's search for the Fountain of Youth would last for several years. It weren't the lure of charmed waters that first sent Jack on a course for the fabled Fountain but rather Jack set off in pursuit of his beloved ship, the Black Pearl, stolen from him by Hector Barbossa. Knowing Barbossa was after the Fountain of Youth as well, Jack attempted to find the Fountain on his own. In his search, Jack was able to find the island where the Fountain was located, and had been close as reaching the cave entrance to the Fountain itself. But Jack never made it to the elusive Fountain and was forced to turn back. Despite not finding the Fountain of Youth, Jack gained some renown as the pirate who knew its location, though some misinterpret that he had been to the Fountain himself. Jack also had the way to the Fountain of Youth committed to his memory.\n\nAt some point in time, Jack Sparrow would have swallowed one of his teeth, which ended up being a part of his new trinket, and woke up with an \"X\" on his right cheek. He also owned another pistol for his effects. Fortune sent Jack Sparrow east across the Atlantic, and it was then he heard tell of Joshamee Gibbs' dire encounter with the authorities of London. So Jack charted a course to London to effect the rescue of his devoted First Mate.\n\nSoon Jack arrived to London to save Joshamee Gibbs from an appointment with the gallows. However, while Gibbs was set to being put on trial for piracy, he was being mistaken for Jack Sparrow himself. Upon arriving to London, he headed to the Old Bailey courthouse to save Gibbs. He bribed the driver of a prison carriage to transport him and Gibbs to shore when the trial was over.\n\nJack tied and gagged the real Judge and put him in a closet, after which Jack resumed as disguising himself as the Judge of Gibbs' trial. Being known as Judge Smith, he had Gibbs pronounced guilty of being innocent of being Jack Sparrow. Much to the surprise of the crowd, Jack had Gibbs condemned to life in prison, rather than a hanging, and allows Gibbs to be transferred to the Tower of London under minimum security.\n\nAfter the trial, Jack took off the Judge disguise as he made his way to signal the prison carriage driver, shortly before joining Gibbs in the prison carriage. Throughout the ride, Gibbs informed Jack about the rumors of him recruiting a crew in the Captain's Daughter pub, in which Jack renounced as completely false and quite insulting. But Jack also thought to find the imposter, because of the need of a ship to escape from England. Gibbs asked Jack of his search for the Fountain of Youth, which he responded that it was temporarily postponed and vowed that he would taste the water of the Fountain.\n\nThe carriage abruptly stopped. Jack and Gibbs then discovered that they were completely surrounded by soldiers of the Royal Guard in front of St. James's Palace. The Guards had also bribed the carriage driver to betray Jack and Gibbs by bringing them to the palace. Jack was forcibly taken into the palace, while Gibbs was sent to prison. In the custody of the Royal Guards, Jack was dragged inside the main hall of St. James's Palace for an audience with His Majesty King George II. Inside the royal banquet room, Jack was chained to a regal seat to await the King's arrival. While he was waiting for the King, he tried to grab a cream puff from the table. Right when the doors open, a surprised Jack kicked the cream puff that he desired up into the air where it got stuck on the room's chandelier. As the doors opened, King George arrived with many of his loyal subjects and Royal Guards. The King was accompanied by Prime Minister Henry Pelham and Lord John Carteret.\n\nLord Carteret asked Jack if he was \"Jack Sparrow\", which Jack responded that the word \"Captain\" was missing in that statement. After much confusion over if Jack was the real Jack Sparrow, the King ordered Jack's chains to be removed, as he was annoyed by Jack rattling the chains. Henry Pelham and King George questions Jack about a map to the Fountain of Youth believed to be in Jack's possession. However, Jack discovered that the map was missing. King George stated that he wanted the Fountain found before the Spanish, as he didn't want King Ferdinand to gain eternal life. Pelham and Carteret asked Jack if he knew the way to the Fountain well enough to guide an expedition. Jack accepted, assuming that he would be provided with a ship and crew. Jack was then introduced to the leader of the expedition; his old rival, Hector Barbossa.\n\nJack and Barbossa had a brief reunion, in which Jack complemented Barbossa's new pirate lifestyle. Barbossa debunked this by revealing that he was now a privateer in service to the King. Jack questioned Barbossa concerning the Black Pearl. Barbossa revealed that he lost the Pearl in a battle which also cost him his leg, which he replaced with a peg leg. Jack angrily reacted to hearing about the loss of his beloved ship and the King's guards had to restrain him to stop him from attacking Barbossa. Before King George and Barbossa resumed their business, Jack made one of his legendary escapes.\n\nJack Sparrow broke free and took out the Royal Guards who held him with their rifles, which he used on the chandelier to make it swing. After taking out some of the guards, Jack got the chance to fly up onto the top of the sill and grabbed the chandelier and swung across the room towards the balcony. King George, Hector Barbossa and the King's subjects stared at the seemingly impossible escape. Jack grabbed the creme puff that was stuck on the chandelier and ate it as he left.\n\nAfter retrieving his sword and pistols. He came to a window, which he opened, and prepared to jump over the busy street. By the time the guards had gotten there, Jack had hidden behind one of the banners hanging between the buildings. The guard spotted Jack's movement and blew his whistle as Jack carefully tried to pull himself back up as another guard appears and hacked at the tassel holding the banner. Jack then plummeted down into a carriage that was driving along the road, landing in a noblewoman's lap, causing her to shriek in horror. Jack stared and then leaned forward, seemingly kissing her while stealing one of her earrings, before climbing on top of the carriage.\n\nSeeing that Royal Guards were after him, Jack managed to stand up on top of the moving carriage and leaped over to the other one. He lost his balance slightly, and put each foot on one carriage. As soon as the carriages parted ways, Jack put both of his feet on one carriage. He eventually made it onto a coal cart. As Jack pushed the cart driver aside, the guards were riding on horses and gaining on Jack as they began to shoot at him, until one shot hit a lantern on the carriage, igniting the coal. Jack jumped to hold onto the sign of the Captain's Daughter tavern and waited until the guards rode past him, then dropped to the ground. Before Jack could go on, a Royal Guard came up from behind and prepared to fire. A shot went off, but the Guard fell dead without pulling the trigger. Jack turned and saw that he had been saved by his father, Captain Teague.\n\nJack went with Teague into the Captain's Daughter tavern, where they conversed about the Fountain of Youth and one of the items needed for the Profane Ritual. Teague then told Jack about the ones who were recruiting a crew for a ship, led by Scrum playing the mandola. Teague also warned Jack that the Fountain would test him as they both took gulps of their drinks. Jack glanced at the crewmen singing with some wenches. When Jack turned around, Teague had vanished. Jack then went to question Scrum, holding a small knife to his throat. As Scrum made fun of Jack, not knowing that he was the real Jack Sparrow, Jack saw a shadow on the wall. He followed it into the storeroom of the tavern. As he looked around, the impostor appeared in front of him. The two Jacks pulled out their swords simultaneously and faced each other in a fierce duel in the storeroom.\n\nThe two ran over to the barbecue pit and circled each other. The impostor copied Jack's exact movements; Jack ran a hand down his beard and the other Jack did the same. Jack was angered by how the impostor mirrored him so well. They clashed swords again. Jack chased the other Jack up a ramp with barrels all the way to one of the bars near the ceiling. The two continued fighting, carefully balancing, shortly before tumbling down along with several barrels. They resumed fighting, evenly matched. Eventually, the other Jack performed an advance swordfighting technique and then pointed his sword at Jack, who then realized who the impostor was. He and other Jack clashed their swords shortly before the two share a kiss. Jack gave his greeting to Angelica.\n\nJack and Angelica had a brief reunion, conversing on Angelica's actions of impersonating Jack, with Jack disapproving that he wasn't being impersonated as captain. Angelica then asked Jack if he had really been to the Fountain of Youth, from rumors she had heard. Suddenly, Scrum came in warning Angelica of King George's Royal Guards breaking into the tavern. As they bursted into the storeroom, Jack and Angelica fought against the guards together. Jack and Angelica had the upper hand by slicing open barrels, ale spraying at the guards. Jack jabbed one barrel, from which wine sprayed out, and he gulped hungrily from it. Angelica pushed him away as the Royal Guards aim their rifles at them. Jack and Angelica glanced at each other, shortly before Jack ducks at Angelica slash at a lever. They fell through a trapdoor into water and swam away, surfacing in the River Thames.\n\nAs the two scramble ashore, Jack learned that Angelica knew about the Profane Ritual. He then inquired about the ritual and what was required. Angelica told him that a mermaid was needed at the exact moment that Jack felt a voodoo dart hit him from behind, shot by Angelica's associate the Quartermaster, knocking him out cold.\n\nAbout five days later, Jack woke up aboard Blackbeard's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, and was forced to work as a deckhand. While doing his duties, he befriended a fellow crewman named Scrum who told him the basics aboard the Revenge, including the zombie officers and Philip Swift, a missionary held captive by being tied on top of the mainmast. Jack also learned that Angelica was the ship's First Mate and secretly confronted her belowdeck. In their conversation, Angelica reveals to Jack that she conned Blackbeard into believing that she was his long lost daughter. Angelica also told Jack why Blackbeard was searching for the Fountain of Youth, because of a prophesied death in the hands of a one-legged man predicted by the Quartermaster.\n\nThat night, not satisfied with being in ship full of zombies, Jack met with Scrum and some of the other crewmen to convince them to join a mutiny. During the meeting, Jack unsuccessfully tried to figure out what Blackbeard's habits from the crewmen, as Blackbeard was never seen outside his cabin. Jack also revealed to the crewmen that their true destination was towards the Fountain of Youth. The crew were shocked by this revelation and knew that their deaths would come for certain, unless they took the ship. After Scrum's failed attempt to lead the crew into the mutiny, Jack ordered the crew to go and take the ship, in which they woke up some of the other crewmen and started their attack.\n\nShortly before the fighting started, not wanting Angelica to be in the middle of the oncoming battle, Jack went to Angelica's cabin to make sure she was safe. When he walked in, he saw that Angelica was sleeping, so he quietly went to grab a sword and a pair of boots and lay down on the bed next to her. Angelica then whispered to Jack that if it was a dream, he could keep the sword and boots. Jack responded by reassuring Angelica that it was a dream, but after she heard some of the fighting on deck, she kicked him away. Getting to his feet, Jack warned her that he was taking the ship. Angelica grabbed a sword and cursed at Jack as he hurried out of the room. After Jack closed the door and locked it, Angelica stabbed her sword through the door, barely an inch away from Jack's head.\n\nThe mutiny began well for Jack and his co-conspirators, fighting well against the other members of Blackbeard's crew which mostly consisted of the zombie crewmen. As Jack Sparrow waltzed into the battle, he was confronted by Gunner and dueled with him. Gunner attacked Jack fiercely, who was able to counter his attacks one by one, until Salaman threw a net that caught on to Gunner. Jack then nodded to Salaman to join him in saving Philip Swift. As they climbed up the rigging, Jack and Salaman climb to Philip's position. Philip is cut free by Jack and they make it down to the continuing battle. As Jack made it to the main deck, he is confronted by the Quartermaster, and dueled with him towards the stairway. After a few attacks, Jack kicked the Quartermaster to the ground, ordered his crew to tie him down and made his way to the upper deck. The moment of victory was at hand for the mutineers, with the enemies, mainly Angelica, the Quartermaster and Gunner, were held back. Jack then declared the Queen Anne's Revenge was theirs. However, at the moment of Jack's triumph, Blackbeard himself appeared on deck and used the mystical powers of his sword to crush the mutiny by hanging Jack and all of the other crewmen.\n\nAfter Blackbeard had Jack cut down, he attempted to shoot Jack, but Angelica stopped him stating that they need him to find the Fountain. A few moments later, after Blackbeard attempted to kill Philip Swift, Jack witnessed the punishment of the Cook, whom Blackbeard burned alive with the ship's Greek fire. Jack was then immediately brought to the captain's cabin for a conversation with Blackbeard. Sparrow tried convincing Blackbeard that Angelica wasn't his daughter. But Blackbeard didn't believe him and, after making a voodoo doll of Jack, stabbed it with a dagger. Angelica arrived as Sparrow immediately felt a heavy pain in his chest and spotted a carved injury on his chest. Angelica and Blackbeard persuaded Jack to lead them to the Fountain of Youth, as Blackbeard held the doll over the fire from a candle, in which Sparrow instantly agreed to take a look at the charts.\n\nLater, Jack had Scrum play a romantic tone on the mandola as Angelica arrived on deck. While offering Angelica a drink, Jack recalled their previous encounters in Saint Dominique and La Martinique. As Scrum began playing the mandola more vigorously, Jack and Angelica danced on the deck of the Revenge. While they danced, Jack told Angelica that they could go to the Fountain of Youth together and have equal shares of fame in exchange for knowledge of the Profane Ritual. While Angelica was skeptical into trusting Jack, she reconsidered after Jack gave her a ring that he gave her in their first romance. Angelica then revealed the ritual to Jack: water from the Fountain, a mermaid's tear, and the Silver Chalices of Ponce de León. She also revealed that those items would be used to take all the years of life from another, a victim, hence why they couldn't do it by themselves. Upon this revelation, Jack's willingness to find the Fountain was greatly lessened.\n\nBut to bribe him, by promising him something he wants, Angelica showed Jack a cabinet full of Blackbeard's trophies\u2014shrunken ships in a bottles, each containing a ship that Blackbeard vanquished. Angelica promised Jack that he would get to choose any of the ships. Looking through the cabinet, Jack was stunned to see the Black Pearl amongst them, with Barbossa's monkey Jack inside. Angelica tells Jack that she needs those years of the victim for Blackbeard, saying that he is her father. Jack tries to warn Angelica otherwise about trying to save Blackbeard, saying that he cannot be redeemed and would kill her. Before they could go further into the discussion, the Queen Anne's Revenge arrived to an island which lied Whitecap Bay, a mermaid nesting ground.\n\nAfter arriving to Whitecap Bay, Jack and Angelica joined with Blackbeard and his crewmen ashore to hunt a mermaid, as they needed a mermaid's tear for the ritual. While some of the men deployed large fishing nets in the shallows, Jack joined the others who made their way to the top of the old lighthouse. After Salaman was able to get the lighthouse in working condition, Jack had to watch as Blackbeard launched several longboats in the water to attract the mermaids. The song from one of the men in the boats, Scrum, soon attracted a group of mermaids. The mermaids, after a few minutes of hesitation, attacked the boats and their crews. The Bay turned into a battlefield, where mermaids attempted to kill all of the men in the boats. After a while, the mermaids began to attack the onshore crew by using ropes of seaweed to pull them into the sea. Jack ordered a retreat to the crewmen to escape inland, but Blackbeard forced them to stay in the water by firing his pistol. Angelica was pulled by one of the mermaids' seaweed ropes, leaving Jack Sparrow to save her.\n\nJack then came up with an idea. He ran towards the lighthouse evading all forms of attacks from the vicious mermaids, losing his sword in the process. As he reached the summit, he began to hit a metal casket full of whale oil until the entire content of oil in it poured out into the fire, which caused an explosion. Jack quickly escaped into the sea as the lighthouse exploded. The fire from the explosion scared off the mermaids further, who Jack viewed swimming away whilst underwater. After a very brief reunion with Marina, a mermaid who Jack knew with in the past, Jack came ashore to find that Blackbeard had successfully captured a young mermaid thanks to Philip Swift. As Angelica gave Jack back his sword, Blackbeard ordered the crewmen to prepare to sail to continue their journey.\n\nAfter relocating the Queen Anne's Revenge to a protected cove of the island, the crew prepared to continue their quest for the Fountain of Youth through dense jungle. Blackbeard and Angelica had Jack Sparrow blindfolded as the crew came inland, so that Jack wouldn't know the exact location of the Revenge. As soon as Blackbeard took off the blindfold, he let Jack lead the way. The crew needed to find Ponce de León's ship, the Santiago, in order to find the two Chalices of Cartagena, another important item needed for the ritual. Jack led the crew through the jungles and swamps of the island with the help of his compass, but soon discovered an obstacle; a broken bridge in a chasm.\n\nJack and Angelica briefly argued over which way to go until Blackbeard took Jack's compass and ordered him to jump over the high cliff. When Jack refused to jump, Blackbeard pulled out his pistol and threatened to kill Angelica. Though Sparrow didn't believe that he would kill his own daughter, Blackbeard had the Quartermaster placed his pistol with six more pistols, with only two of them being loaded, but with Blackbeard not knowing which. Jack thought that none of them were loaded, until he fired a loaded pistol into air. Jack then knew that Blackbeard was serious and was forced to either jump or choose again. Jack then asked the Quartermaster about the possibility of surviving the jump. The Quartermaster took Jack's voodoo doll and threw it into the river. Jack screamed as it fell, but the Quartermaster assured him that he would survive. When Angelica attempted to jump, Jack ran and jumped before her, successfully falling into the river unscathed. While Blackbeard and Angelica continued their search for the Fountain, Jack proceeded into finding the Santiago.\n\nRacing through jungles and running across the beachside, Jack found where the Santiago could be seen hanging precariously on a cliffside. After having climbed up to the wreckage, Jack entered the captain's cabin, spotting Ponce de León's corpse on a bed, where he reunited with Hector Barbossa.\n\nSeeing that they were both after the same prize, Jack wanted to fight Hector Barbossa. But the balance of the Santiago was so unstable that when they moved, the ship dangerously leaned. As Jack and Barbossa put the ship into balance, a chest slid from under the bed. They knew that the chest held the Chalices they both sought, but caused the ship to go unbalanced again. After getting the ship into balance again, Jack and Barbossa decided to open it together. However, they only discovered that there was nothing inside, except for two stones instead of the two Chalices. They both realized that the Spaniard's men already took the Chalices. Taking a look at a map in the hands of Ponce de León's corpse, Jack and Barbossa found where the Spanish would make their camp.\n\nJack and Barbossa later found the location of the Spanish camp where they met up with Barbossa's men, with Joshamee Gibbs among them. Jack and Gibbs had a brief reunion with Jack realizing that Gibbs stole Jack's map. As the crew journeyed to the Spanish camp, Jack and Gibbs discussed Jack's problem of rescuing Angelica, a damsel that he had feelings for long ago and left. Once the group was close to the camp, Barbossa ordered his men to stay back and wait for the signal. Both Jack and Barbossa managed to infiltrate the camp and stealthily steal the Chalices. However, after attempting to just walk out and fighting off some Spanish soldiers, the two are captured.\n\nThe Spanish tied both Jack and Barbossa to palm trees in Palm Tree Grove. After minutes of trying to find a way to get free, Jack saw Barbossa drinking up rum from his peg leg, instantly wanting one. While having a drink from the wooden leg, Jack reveals that he saw through Barbossa's new image from the start, especially when he was more interested in facing Blackbeard rather than finding the Chalices. Because of Jack knowing this, Barbossa told Jack what really happened with the Pearl, which was that Blackbeard took the Pearl by having the ship come to life and turned against him and his crew. Barbossa told Jack that he wanted a chance at Blackbeard, which Jack agreed that it would happen, as he got free of his bonds.\n\nStill tied up, Jack climbs upwards a palm tree with Barbossa looking. Jack was able to reached the top, untie himself, and then catapults into another tree, which Barbossa's men took as the signal. The Spanish saw Jack escaping and fanned out to find him until coconuts fall on them. Jack swings down the trees and circles around one of the trees and tie some very bewildered Spaniards up. Meeting up with Barbossa and his men, Jack revealed that he had gotten ahold of the Chalices. Jack continued on with his joint enterprise with Barbossa.\n\nIn the middle of the jungle, Jack was able to catch up with Angelica and Blackbeard, who were successful at obtaining a mermaid's tear from the young mermaid they captured, Syrena. Jack presented the Chalices tied onto a wild boar held on a leash by Joshamee Gibbs, but wasn't willing to give them away without a few conditions. Jack's conditions were for Blackbeard to bring no harm to Angelica, the return of Jack's compass and the freedom of Gibbs. Blackbeard considered it done. Jack gave his compass to Gibbs, who was going to retrieve the Black Pearl from the Queen Anne's Revenge for Jack. The crew went on to find the Fountain of Youth.\n\nWith having the route to the Fountain of Youth memorized, Jack Sparrow searches through the jungles to find the cave entrance to the Fountain. After searching through many huge palm fronds, Jack spotted a water droplet traveling up on one of the fronds, defying gravity. He watched it as it crawled upwards, then starts toying with it between his fingers. Jack then squints through it, spotting a rock wall in front of him with the archaic symbol of the Fountain. The droplet broke free of Jack's finger and floated upwards, just as Jack discovered the cave entrance. Jack followed the Quartermaster as he led Jack, Angelica, Blackbeard and the rest of the Revenge's crew into the cavern until they reached across a wall, a dead end. Upon seeing the seemingly end of the quest, Angelica began to suspect that Jack didn't know where he was going. It wasn't until Jack unsuccessfully attempted to gain entrance into the Fountain of Youth, by hitting the two Chalices against one another, that everyone realized that Jack had never been to the Fountain.\n\nAngered by the revelation, Blackbeard ordered the Quartermaster to kill Jack Sparrow. The Quartermaster fired his pistol but Jack shielded himself with the Chalices and the bullet ricochets off them. Blackbeard aimed his own pistol at Sparrow, who started to read the words inscribed on the Chalices, \"Aqua de Vida\". Water gradually started rising up along the walls, collecting into a pool above their heads. Jack then climbed onto Scrum's shoulders, holding his sword and poked the pool\u2014the sword was sucked into the water, right before Jack Sparrow himself was sucked into a misty environment. As he went to pick up his sword, Jack found himself in the Fountain of Youth.\n\nJack continued forward as the rest of the crew arrived. Right in front of them was the Fountain itself, a natural stone archway-like basin with water dripping through. Jack walked up to the central stone reaching to touch the water, but Blackbeard stopped him, stating that he'll be the first to drink from it. However, Hector Barbossa and his men arrived to the Fountain to confront Blackbeard and his men. Angelica realized that Jack had brought them there. Barbossa and Blackbeard both pulled out their swords and ordered their crews to attack. Jack then bursts in between the parties, questioning the sense in both sides fighting just because of Barbossa's desire to kill Blackbeard. He suggested that the captains fight each other, while everyone else lays back, watches, drinks and place wagers. Scrum agreed to the plan. However, the battle between the crews erupted.\n\nAs the fight went on, Jack briefly dueled with Scrum for the tear to the Fountain. Jack took the tear from Scrum by kicking him in the stomach\u2014only to find himself threatened by both Scrum and Angelica, who pointed their swords at him. Jack tossed the tear into the air, Angelica tried to grab it, which causes her and Scrum to throw their swords up in the air as well, and both swords end up in Jack's hands. After another toss around, Jack ends up with the tear and Scrum ends up with the Chalices. Jack kicks the Chalices out of Scrum's hands over to the other side of the Fountain. Jack and Angelica then end up in a struggle with the Chalices, until the Spaniard and his men arrive.\n\nAfter the Spaniard killed off Theodore Groves, Jack gave the Chalices to Angelica as the Spaniard walked towards them. The Spaniard then took the Chalices from Angelica and revealed the Spanish's true intentions\u2014to destroy the Fountain of Youth. He then smashed the Chalices and tossed them into a deep pool. As the Spanish destroyed the temple, Barbossa stabbed Blackbeard with his poisoned sword. Angelica ran to her father's side to remove the sword, but Jack was too late to warn her as she cut her hand and poisoned herself in the process. Seeing that Angelica was in danger, Jack ran to find the Chalices. As the Spanish began pulling down the columns, Jack searched through the pools where the Spaniard had tossed the Chalices in an attempt to find them. As Angelica desperately tried to help Blackbeard, the remainder of Blackbeard's crewmen left with Barbossa. The Spanish struggled with a large column as Gunner and the Quartermaster fought off the Spanish soldiers. Jack looked up as the large column was pulled over and crushed the two zombies, as well as the Fountain. The Spanish then leave. Only Jack was left, still searching for the Chalices until Syrena emerged from the water holding the battered silver Chalices. Jack took them as Syrena told him to not waste her tear shortly before she disappeared back into the water. Jack ran quickly to the fallen, cracked basin and managed to fill each Chalice with a few drops of the water from the Fountain before it dried up. He added the tear to one of the cups. Jack then went to Angelica and Blackbeard to perform the Profane Ritual.\n\nJack offered both Blackbeard and Angelica the Chalices, with Jack attempting to convince Blackbeard to save Angelica by drinking from the Chalice that takes life. But in his greed, Blackbeard quickly drank out of the cup with the tear and told Angelica to save him. Though shocked, Angelica willingly drank from the other Chalice. However, Jack revealed that he may have switched the cups. Blackbeard then tried to attack Sparrow, but staggered, being stuck standing in the same spot. As Angelica's wound immediately healed as the flowing waters of the Fountain rushed towards Blackbeard. Jack watched as the Fountain's waters completely surrounded Blackbeard, rotting his flesh away. The waters then cleared away as Blackbeard's lifeless skeleton collapsed, dead.\n\nLater, Jack Sparrow had Angelica tied up aboard a row boat as he took her to Sola Fide Beach. Even though her own life was saved, Angelica told Jack that she hated him because he had her taking years from Blackbeard, her own father. Jack told Angelica that he helped Blackbeard do what any father should do in that situation. Upon arriving to the desert island, Jack threw Angelica a pistol with one shot. Angelica desperately tried to convince Jack not to leave her there by first trying to get him to admit that he still loved her, then telling him about a treasure with jewels and that she was pregnant with his child. Jack refused all those claims, believing them to be lies.\n\nAngelica then told Jack that she loved him, to which Jack stated that he did as well and always will. They lean in to kiss each other, but not before Jack ran for his dinghy. Angelica angrily called out to Jack and then used her pistol with one shot to try and shoot him, but missed. Jack rowed away in his longboat as Angelica was simply left to curse at him.\n\nBeached on a sandy shore, Jack rejoins Joshamee Gibbs, who was lying on a piece of driftwood. Jack asked Gibbs about the profit in their cooperation, by using Jack's compass to locate the Queen Anne's Revenge and sneak aboard to retrieve the Black Pearl in the bottle. As Jack glanced at his beloved Pearl in his possession once again, Gibbs revealed that he also took all the other ships that Blackbeard had magically shrunk and bottled. As Jack took a closer look on the Pearl, he saw Jack the Monkey swinging at his face, to his disgust. When Gibbs asked Jack if he had any idea to get her out, which Jack said that they needed a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats, and that one of them must play the trumpet while the other wiggles his fingers. Gibbs said that he knew someone with a goat, which made Jack immediately think he could be the one to wiggle his fingers.\n\nAs they later walked on the beach of the island during a Caribbean sunset, Gibbs asked Jack why he didn't choose to use the Fountain of Youth, even though he had all the items, saying that he could've lived forever. Jack told Gibbs that the Fountain tests you, and that it's better to not know your last moment. He also said that he would live forever being named as the discoverer of the Fountain. Jack told Gibbs of his determination to continue a pirate's life. His further fate is unknown.\n\nFollowing the quest for the Fountain of Youth, Jack and Gibbs decided to return to piracy. Unable to pull the Black Pearl out of its bottle prison Jack always carried it with him in his journies. Jack and Gibbs assembled a new crew and obtained a new ship, an old sloop called the Dying Gull. Over the next year Jack and his crew embarked on several adventures, searching for mythical treasures like the gold of King Midas and the treasure of Macedonia. However, even though they succeeded in finding those treasure, all of them turned out to be worthless. As Jack's luck run out, the reward that the British authorities offered for his capture steadily declined from one hundred pounds to just one pound. Some people even believed that Jack was dead and buried in an unmarked grave on the island of Saint Martin.\n\nA year after the battle for the Fountain of Youth, Jack and his crew found themselves on the island of Saint Martin, a British colony in the Lesser Antilles. With their ship stranded on the shore and the entire crew starving, they made a plan to rob the new bank in the town of Saint Martin. Jack met and seduced Frances, the wife of Mayor Dix, ending up in the bank vault, but he got drunk and passed out. He was found in the safe the next morning in the middle of the opening ceremony where he was identified as a pirate. The guards prepared to kill him but the bank was dragged away by his crew along with Jack whose leg was caught by a rope. Soon Jack was freed from the rope and was chased by guards before he eluded them by hiding in an astronomer's shop. Jack then met and helped a young woman elude the soldiers before meeting back with his crew who he escaped with.\n\nAt the ship, the crew prepared to reap the riches only to find that the vault empty (having lost the money along the way). The crew then became fed up with Jack for the lack of money and that his reputation was now insignificant to that of Hector Barbossa who now ruled the seas with his powerful fleet. The crew was further fed when Jack asked them to pay him and decided to leave his services including Gibbs who told his old friend that they have reached the end of the horizon.\n\nDistraught by his lost crew and failing career, Jack traveled into town where he fell in mud before going to the local tavern where he bartered his prized compass while ignoring the shaking caused by the incident. Jack drank his pain away before he was confronted by guards over the robbery and the guards boasted out to the town they have apprehended him.\n\nIn his cell, Jack devised an escape plan by making a dummy and preparing to attack a guard for his sword. When one guard passed, Jack put his plan into the action but learned the young man who was really pretending to be a soldier as he was wanted for treason. The boy stating he was searching for him though was disappointed in what he saw in the real Jack. He then introduced himself as Henry Turner, the son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann and Jack was told by Henry that he needs his help in finding the Trident of Poseidon to free his father but Jack was uninterested in the quest falling asleep mid-way. Henry then asked Jack if he knew a man named Armando Salazar. As Jack recalled the name, he told Henry that the man was dead to which Henry replied that Salazar died in the Devil's Triangle but was resurrected and now leading an army of ghosts to kill Jack telling the surprised and worried Jack that he now needed the trident to defeat them.\n\nThe next morning, Sparrow was taken out of his cell by the guards. As he was dragged through the corridor he heard someone singing Maggie Mae. As he saw the singer in a cell playing cards with two other imprisoned pirates, he mistook him for his father, Captain Teague, but when he called him the man turned around, revealing himself to be his uncle, Jack. Sparrow and Jack talked for a few moments, with Jack advising his nephew to stay on land where it's safe as the oceans have turned to blood, but Sparrow replied that he was just about to be executed on land. Sparrow was then taken away for execution.\n\nIn the town square Sparrow was asked by the soldiers if he wanted to be executed by stoning, hanging, or with the new invention, the guillotine. Believing that something that sounded French couldn't be so dangerous he picked the guillotine but was dismayed to learn it was a device meant to decapitate him. When the guards strapped him to the instrument he interrupted the final speech of Carina Smyth resulting in an argument. Their bickering annoyed the crowd so much that Lieutenant Scarfield demanded that they both be executed at once. Fortunately for the two convicts, Henry Turner arrived along with Jack's crew who were paid to help. The crew fired a cannonball into the plantform that held the guillotine, causing a mass confusion. The prisoners were able to escape the area.\n\nThe crew make their way to the Dying Gull where they finally have the ship set sail and though they have a hitch, the ship makes its voyage. During the journey, Jack has Carina serve as navigator with her maps threatening the life of Henry if she doesn't comply aware she might have feeling for him. Jack has his men throw Henry overboard and after he gets the information, he reveals Henry was thrown in a lifeboat tied to the ship.\n\nAs the ship made its journey, Jack got drunk again as Henry lashed out at him even threatening him with a sword but an unfazed Jack pulled out  his pistol telling Henry if he threatened him again to prepare to die. Jack soon noticed the affection Henry had for Carina offering him some bad advice.\n\nThe crew then continued the journey before seeing they were being tailed by the Silent Mary as the crew were angered by Jack withholding this information and threatened to kill him. Jack managed to persuade them to mutiny surrendering his captain position to Gibbs while he, Henry and Carina sailed off in a rowboat.\n\nThe Silent Mary continued following them as Carina prepared to dive into the water something Jack admired for being similar to him in that regard. He silenced Henry as she took off her dress and swam ashore as Henry prepared to follow her but Salazar released undead Sharks after them. Jack and Henry constantly dealt with their repeated attacks as well as the charging Salazar and his crew. Jack narrowly managed to save Henry from being eaten as they crashed on a nearby island where Jack was confronted by the undead specter of his nemesis Salazar but he is relieved that he or his men can't step foot on land. Salazar tells Jack he will wait for him to escape the island to exact his revenge as the terrified Jack tries to dissuade him before running off.\n\nAs he and Henry ran off in the jungle, Jack poked fun at Henry's feelings for Carina but was dismayed to learn the island they were on was Hangman's Bay. They found Carina trapped in a net and moved to help her but were caught in a net as well before one of the island inhabitants came and knocked Jack out.\n\nJack awoke with a rope tied to his neck and found Henry and Carina tied up before he locked eyes with an old acquaintance Pig Kelly who he was afraid to see since he owed him a large debt. Kelly declared Jack would repay him by marrying his sister which Jack was terrified of since she had an unappealing appearance and children. Jack was not willing to marry even when Kelly threatened his life but when Carina and Henry pointed out that union wasn't legal he was relieved. After they asked if anyone objected, Jack inadvertently said \"I do\" which caused the wedding to proceed but before she could kiss him Hector Barbossa arrived. As a wedding gift, he gets rid of Kelly and his men which saves Jack from the forced marriage, much to his joy.\n\nBarbossa then tells Jack he needs him to defeat Salazar for sinking his ships. Jack is skeptical as there is no ship that could evade the Silent Mary but Barbossa brought up the Black Pearl. He then used the Sword of Triton to stab into the bottle to release the Pearl from imprisonment but it half grew since Jack placed it on land so Barbossa threw it into the water as Jack briefly mourned its presumed sinking until the ocean shook. The Black Pearl then rose from the sea back to its natural size as Jack happily looked at his precious vessel final restored. However, his joy was short-lived as Barbossa held him at gunpoint to assume command of the ship for himself.\n\nWith Barbossa in charge of his precious ship again, a helpless Jack was tied to the mast of the ship as the ship set sail. On the seas, Jack protested the idea of moving past the lands as he knew Salazar couldn't set foot on land. During his incapacitation, Jack overheard a conversation between Barbossa and Carina in which he recognized Carina's last name Smyth. He taunted Barbossa by asking about a woman named Margaret Smyth as Barbossa got angry while Jack was pleased he had leverage against him. He soon question how Barbossa could have a daughter like Carina before demanding his compass, rum, and Jack (monkey) (to eat) but he was gagged by the monkey and ignored.\n\nA captive Jack soon witnessed the arrival of the Essex before it was attacked by Salazar causing him to panic as the ghost ship began attacking the Pearl. As Jack struggled to break free, he was quickly released by Henry before Salazar could reach him. Swing off a rope, Jack managed landed on the cannon of one of the Silent Mary's ship as Salazar appeared and began chasing him. As he ran away, Jack faced several obstacles with Salazar and his ghost ship before he was blown into the ship. Jack did battle with Salazar who knocked him down but Jack continued to hold his own before his sword was knocked away. As the undead captain prepared to kill him, Jack spotted Black rock island where the Trident was and with Salazar momentarily distracted, Jack used it as a way to escape back to his ship.\n\nArriving at the island, Carina remarked to Jack on how beautiful as Jack questioned if she meant the rocks but is told that the island was a reflection of the heavens that her father wanted her to find. Before they transverse the area, Jack told Barbossa of his daughter's occupation as they set off. Jack then watched Carina take the ruby from her book and put it on the missing half of the ruby on the island which opened the seas to reveal the location of the trident which Sparrow and Smyth fell through. After falling a long way, the two managed to locate the trident, Jack and Carina were attacked by a possessed Henry who began to fight Sparrow, while the crew of the Silent Mary saw them from within the other two parts of the sea.\n\nThe battle ended when Salazar left Henry's body and obtained the Trident of Poseidon which he used to throw Sparrow through the water, where Lieutenant Lesaro and the rest of the crew attempted to grab him and drown him. After catching his breath, Sparrow told Salazar his previous words of surrendering as he did years ago as Salazar was through toying with him and stabbed Jack in the chest with the trident, shushing him as he attempted to push the trident more into his body. However, Jack, now realizing the Trident stabbed a book held in his jacket kept the weapon in place and urged Henry to help. Henry grabbed his sword and sent it crashing down on the Trident, breaking it in half, breaking all the curses of the sea turning Salazar and his men back to humans again.\n\nJack, Henry, and Carina then saw the walls of water coming down and realized that this would mean death but they saw the anchor of the pearl lowering with Hector Barbossa on it imploring them to run. The trio quickly ran to safety and managed to climb on board, but were followed by Salazar and two of his crew members. As Salazar began to climb the anchor he drew his sword, not satisfied with letting Jack escape and still eager for vengeance, he attempted to reach Carina and end her life. After Barbossa realized Salazar was making his way toward his daughter, he ordered her to hold on to the anchor. Jack then shouted \"Hector!\" as he threw him a sword. Jack was shocked when Barbossa let go of the anchor and grasped the sword and allowed himself to fall. He then witnessed Barbossa piercing Salazar through the back with the blade, causing him to let go of the anchor and knock down both of his crew members who held onto the anchor. Salazar then came tumbling down to the ocean floor, letting out a scream of horror, which was soon silenced by him landing face first on the bottom of the anchor below, killing him. His body was then consumed by the surrounding waves, ending El Matador del Mar's reign of the Seven Seas once and for all.\n\nWith Salazar vanquished, Jack and his group returned to the surface. Jack was distraught by the death of his longtime rival sadly remarking \"A pirate's life, eh Hector?\" as he and his crew mourned Barbossa's sacrifice. Jack noticed Carina's sad expression and helped Henry win her over by giving him her book so he could comfort her.\n\nJack then used the Black Pearl to drop Henry and Carina home. On the ship, Jack used his telescope and witnessed Elizabeth and Will's reunion along with the new union of Henry and Carina. Jack remarked that their happiness was truly a \"revolting sight\".\n\nAfterwards, with his precious ship returned to him and with his crew now consisting of the remainder of Barbossa's and his own; Sparrow took to the helm when  Jack appeared surprising him. Unlike their previous interactions, Jack instead gave him back his  lost compass as he nervously accepted the gesture. Gibbs soon asked Jack what their heading was as Jack told they would follow the stars, an order that his first mate happily followed.\n\nAs he prepared to depart, Jack climbed onto his shoulder as Sparrow looked surprised and put off at first but quickly changed his expression and accepted him back. With the sea tamed, Jack had the Pearl set sail towards the horizon. His further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jack_Sparrow"}}

It is known that he was a great sailor, who fell in love with the goddess Calypso, who was changing, harsh and untamable as the sea. There were different versions of the story, which said that Jones either fell in love with a woman or the sea. Calypso rewarded that love by giving Davy Jones the sacred task of collecting all the poor souls who lost at sea and ferry them to the other side. To carry out this task, Calypso gave him the Flying Dutchman, a ship which could enter the limbo-like dimension that came to be known as Davy Jones' Locker. Because of that love, Jones agreed to set foot on dry land once every ten years.\n\nFor the next ten years, Jones devoted himself faithfully to the duty Calypso charged him with, looking after those who died at sea and ferried the souls of men to the 'other side' in the holds of the Dutchman, while also awaiting the one day when he could be reunited with his love. But when Davy Jones came ashore, he waited in vain; Calypso was nowhere to be found. Feeling that the goddess betrayed him, a heartbroken and enraged Davy Jones believed he had been tricked into his duty, and could not escape his service. Using The Journal of the Ancient Seas and its guardian, the foul and fearsome Kraken, Jones went on his course to vengeance. With the Kraken, Jones intended to hunt down the objects of power that laid scattered across the seas and have the loyalty of the first Pirate Lords of the seas. So, when the First Brethren Court convened, Davy Jones plotted with them to tear the rule of the seas away from Calypso. As part of an agreement, Davy Jones showed the First Court how to bind Calypso in human form, so that they could secure the rule of the seas for themselves. The Brethren captured Calypso and imprisoned the sea goddess into the body of a mortal woman, later known as the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma.\n\nSoon Davy Jones' grief and guilt at what he had done became so great, he carved out his own heart right out of his chest, and locked it in the Dead Man's Chest. To keep his fate intact, Jones had the chest hidden on Isla Cruces so it could be safe from potential mutineers aboard the Flying Dutchman and away from his haunted sight. He kept the key hidden within his facial tentacles at all times. Whoever gained control of the chest was able to control Jones by extortion. Jones was immortal so long as his heart remained safe.\n\nWith Calypso gone, Davy Jones abandoned his duty and returned to the Seven Seas. As a result of this, Jones gradually became monstrous, his physical appearance merging with various aquatic fauna. Sailors everywhere would fear him to the death, for Davy Jones had turned fierce and cruel, with an insatiable taste for all things brutal. Most stories told say that a terrible beast, known as the Kraken, was Davy Jones' obedient leviathan, sent to do his bidding and prey on unwary ships and mariners. The Kraken brought the captain of the Flying Dutchman ever more souls onto his cursed ship, dying sailors forever press-ganged into servitude. Those who joined his crew were bound to serve aboard his ship for one hundred years, but like Jones, their appearance merged with various aquatic fauna. However, unlike Jones, the effect of the deal that they lose their humanity, which worsened over time, until they become part of the ship itself. Jones became a tyrant on his ship, and mercilessly pushed his crew to exhaustion, allowing his sadistic officers to enforce vicious punishments for even minor offenses. Eventually crew members lost their humanity in soul as well as in body. Jones wreaked havoc on the Seven Seas, and created an aura of fear wherever he sailed, only able to make port or step on land every decade.\n\nDavy Jones showed interest in the Sword of Cortés, and during Jack Sparrow\u2019s early years forced Captain Torrents to retrieve it for him. Torrents failed, and Jones eventually confronted Jack Sparrow, who had previously given the Sword over to Tia Dalma. With the Sword unavailable, Jones set his sights on a different artifact, and pursued Sparrow in search of the Timekeeper, hoping to go back in time and make sure that Calypso reunited with him.Jones also ruled over the Siren and mermaid kingdom of Isla Sirena, which resided in his Locker.\n\nFor some unknown reason, both Jones and Sparrow soon completely forgot their first encounter. A few years after the \"timekeeper\" incident, Jones was summoned by the Pirate Lords to Shipwreck Cove on board the Troubadour, the ship of Captain Edward Teague, Keeper of the Code. The Brethren Court was endangered by the mysterious rogue pirates, and Jones was summoned to help the Pirate Lords in identifying Boris \"Borya\" Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea, as the leader of the rogues. Jones successfully identified Borya as the rogue captain, and he also revealed to them that there were seven rogue captains in Borya's fleet.\n\nFive years after helping the Brethren to identify the traitors among them, Jones was summoned by Jack Sparrow, who sunk with his ship and ended up in Jones' supernatural realm. Sparrow asked Jones to raise his ship, the Wicked Wench, from the ocean depths, after it was burned and scuttled on the orders of Cutler Beckett. Jack offered a proposal: in return for raising the Wicked Wench from the ocean floor, Jack would give Jones his soul after being captain for thirteen years, and would then serve on board the Flying Dutchman for the following century. Jones agreed and raised the ship from the depths of the ocean, and gave it to Jack. Only time would tell if Sparrow would live up to his side of the bargain.\n\nFor only two years did Jack Sparrow remain captain of his ship, which had been re-christened as the Black Pearl, before a mutiny lost him his beloved ship. Having been opposed to the mutiny, William \"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner, who had been cursed with immortality, was strapped to a cannon and cast into the sea by Hector Barbossa. Davy Jones found him on the seabed, and gave him the chance to spare himself one kind of tortured existence for another. Such was his desperation, Turner agreed, and became one of Jones' newest crewmembers. It was he whom Jones sent to warn Sparrow his debt was to be called in, thirteen years after their deal, and Turner marked the pirate with the Black Spot on Jones' orders. Jones called upon the Kraken and set it after Jack, though he continued about his usual business with the destruction of a ship near a isolated shoal. Jones sent his men to collect the surviving crew members, so that he could force them to join his crew aboard the Dutchman.\n\nWhile Jones was convincing the survivors to join his crew, he noticed a man among them that was neither dead nor dying, thus not a member of the ill-fated crew. A suspicious Jones asked what his business was, and the man told him that he had come to settle Jack Sparrow's debt. Jones realized that Sparrow was attempting to weasel his way out of his debt, and knew that Sparrow had to be nearby. He spotted the Black Pearl and teleported to it. His men seized Sparrow's small crew, while Jones himself confronted Sparrow.\n\nSparrow tried to explain to Jones that he only been captain of the Pearl for two years, but Jones pointed out that despite this, Sparrow had gone on calling himself \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow, even though he did not truly have the Black Pearl under his command. Thus, he technically claimed it was under his ownership for thirteen years even if he was nowhere near it for most of that time. Sparrow then pointed out that the man he had sent, Will Turner, was his payment, one soul for one ship. Jones became frustrated and told Sparrow that one soul was not equal to another, and when Sparrow asked for the number of souls his own soul was worth, Jones snidely told him he had three days to gather one hundred souls. Jones removed the Black Spot from Sparrow and kept Will as a good-faith payment, and allowed Sparrow to go on his way to collect the remaining ninety-nine souls.\n\nWhile playing his organ one rainy night, Jones heard a loud crash coming from the main deck. When he went to investigate, he discovered Bootstrap Bill trying to save Will Turner from Jimmy Legs' cat o' nine tails. When Jones probed Bootstrap for his motives, he discovered that Will was Bootstrap's son. Making the connection between the names, Jones became highly amused. He then forced Bootstrap to either punish Will himself, or suffer Jimmy Legs to do the same. Knowing that Bootstrap would prefer his hand to the sadistic boatswain's, Jones watched with a sinister enjoyment as Bootstrap Bill begrudgingly whipped Will five times.\n\nLater that night, Will challenged Jones to a game of Liar's dice. He offered to serve aboard the Dutchman for an eternity, in exchange for the key to the Dead Man's Chest. Fearing for the safety of his heart, though refusing to show weakness in front of his crew, Jones agreed. Just as they were about to start, however, Bootstrap Bill joined them, in an attempt to decrease the odds of his son serving onboard the ship forever. Jones accepted this turn of events, and played on. As the game progressed, Jones cornered Will in a lie. Before Jones could call him out, however, Bootstrap took a dive for his son. Jones declared Bootstrap a liar and, having won the game, said he would spend an eternity on the Dutchman. Before leaving the room, Davy Jones told Will Turner that he was free to go ashore, but with the added twist that it'd be the next time they make port.\n\nThe next morning, Davy Jones realized that Will had stolen his key, and had escaped with the aid of his father. Beside himself with rage and fear, Jones set the Flying Dutchman hot on Turner's trail. The ship came up on the Edinburgh Trader, a merchant vessel, but Jones knew Will was onboard. He summoned the Kraken and forced Bootstrap Bill to watch as the Edinburgh Trader was destroyed by the Kraken. Turner was not discovered among the dead, however, as Jones knew that Will had been sent by Sparrow to steal his key. Realizing that Sparrow intended to use his heart as a bargaining chip to escape his debt, Jones ordered his navigator, Koleniko, to set a course for Isla Cruces.\n\nUpon reaching Isla Cruces, Jones spotted some of Sparrow's crew on the deserted island through his spyglass. Since he himself was unable to set foot on land for nearly a decade, he ordered his First Mate, Maccus, to lead a team to go ashore and seize the chest. He ordered the ship to dive, and the men swam to the island. After a while the crewmen returned with the chest. It was then that Jones set out to find Jack Sparrow to collect his debt personally. The Flying Dutchman rose out of the water and pulled alongside the Black Pearl. Sparrow confronted Jones and taunted him with a jar of dirt. Annoyed with Sparrow's games, he ordered his cannonneers to open fire. The Black Pearl turned completely around avoiding most of the barrage, and the Flying Dutchman turned in hot pursuit. As the Black Pearl sailed farther away, Jones ordered his chief gunner, Ogilvey, to fire the chase guns, though they were only able to deliver minimal damage as the swift and nimble Black Pearl slipped out of range. Jones broke off the pursuit and summoned the Kraken to destroy Sparrow.\n\nJones watched from afar as the Kraken was repelled several times. At last it came to an end and Jack Sparrow and his ship were dragged down by the Kraken to the Locker. Jones became suspicious of how easy it was to defeat Sparrow, and suspected treachery on his part. With mounting concern, he went to check on his heart and to his amazement and horror, discovered only an empty chest. Enraged, Jones thought of this to be of Jack Sparrow's doing and screamed in anguish instilling fear and pain in his crew.\n\nDespite the fact that Sparrow was supposedly dead, Jones felt a summons from his heart and set sail for the source of the summons, Port Royal. Upon arriving, he found the very man who had inadvertently spawned Sparrow's debt with Jones, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. Beckett had Jones' heart, presented to him by a former member of Jack Sparrow's crew \u2014James Norrington. Jones gave took off his hat in respect for his new master.\n\nLord Beckett used Davy Jones to attack and destroy pirate ships all across the Caribbean. Beckett was distrustful of Davy Jones, however, and he forced Jones to kill the Kraken, by ordering it to beach itself on an island. Davy Jones did not accept servitude lightly, and adopted a bad mood whenever in the presence of Beckett. During his attacks against pirates, Jones obliterated every single vessel he was faced with, destroying ship after ship with ease. However, he was so brutal, that he left absolutely no survivors, and left no piece of wood unbroken. This destructive streak annoyed Beckett, because of his desire for prisoners to interrogate. Jones did not care about Beckett's quest for information, but in retribution, Beckett had the chest taken aboard the Flying Dutchman. Armed guards protected the chest at all times, and were ordered to kill Jones if he did not follow Beckett's orders more closely to the letter. Beckett also stationed aboard the Flying Dutchman, the very man who stole Jones' heart to begin with, James Norrington, now an admiral. Jones was irritated by the heart's presence on his ship, because it constantly reminded him of his servitude.\n\nJones was ordered to find and capture the ship of an infamous Chinese pirate, the Empress. Jones easily caught up to the ship, and after several cannon shots, his crew boarded the vessel and apprehended the crew. Jones found Elizabeth Swann, who claimed to be the captain of the Empress. Jones was in disbelief that she was the captain of the infamous vessel, but Admiral Norrington recognized her, and he had the crew of the Empress locked in the Flying Dutchman's brig. The Empress was tied to the Flying Dutchman, and towed slowly behind, as Jones set out to rejoin Beckett's armada.\n\nDuring the night, the crew of the Empress were set free by Admiral Norrington, who was in turn stabbed by Bootstrap Bill, who had been locked in the brig since helping his son escape the Flying Dutchman. Davy Jones tried to recruit the dying Norrington into his crew, but the moribund admiral simply stabbed Jones' shoulder, before succumbing to his wounds. Jones admired the sword he had been stabbed with, and kept it for himself.\n\nJones believed he was finally free from Beckett's control. He ordered his crew to kill the East India Trading Company soldiers stationed on the ship only to find that Beckett's second in command, Mercer, still possessed the key to the chest, and was still guarding the chest with a few other soldiers. Jones begrudgingly accepted Mercer's control of the ship.\n\nThe Flying Dutchman finally caught up with Beckett's ship, the HMS Endeavour. Fresh troops from the Endeavour refreshed the ones killed by Jones' crew. Jones was once again summoned aboard, much to his mounting annoyance. When he walked into Beckett's quarters, he was shocked to see Will Turner having tea with the mighty enemy of pirates. Will told Jones that he and the surviving crew of the Black Pearl had gone to the Locker, and freed the soul of Jack Sparrow. Jones shock was soon overcome by anger, since it was apparent that Beckett was well aware of the plot. However, Beckett asked Jones of his old love, Calypso. Jones told Beckett that the world was rid of Calypso, but he was rebuked by Turner, who informed him that the Brethren Court intended to release Calypso from her human form. Jones told Beckett that the Brethren couldn't release Calypso due to a bargain he had with them. Beckett became suspicious of this comment, and inquired as to Jones' involvement with the Brethren Court. Jones confessed that he was the one who revealed to the Court how to bind Calypso, but said that she was untrustworthy and it had been the proper thing to do. Will realized that Jones had loved her and that asked him if she had betrayed him for betraying her, or vice versa. Jones became annoyed with Turner, and the two came close to exchanging blows before Beckett asked Turner how he intended to lead them to the Brethren. He told them that he wanted Jones to set his father free in exchange for the location of Shipwreck Cove, the meeting place of the Brethren. Turner offered Beckett Jack's compass, a mystical item that could lead its user to the thing that they wanted most. Jones told Turner that he would only accept if Calypso was murdered, and so Will told Jones that she was imprisoned on the Black Pearl. With that, Jones set off on the Flying Dutchman to meet Calypso one last time.\n\nJones reached Shipwreck Cove and confronted Tia Dalma in the Black Pearl's brig. He expressed his hatred of her for her betrayal. Dalma said that she still loved him, but that her untameable nature prevented her from waiting for him. Jones' mood slowly mellowed, and he asked what fate she had planned for the Brethren Court, to which she said that they would suffer a cruel fate at her hands. Jones offered his heart and his love to her once again, and agreed to join her later on after she was free.\n\nJones, Beckett, and Will met with the Brethren Court's emissaries\u2013\u2013Hector Barbossa, Elizabeth Swann, and Jack Sparrow\u2013on a sandbar in between Beckett's fleet and the fleet of the Brethren Court. Barbossa and Elizabeth offered Jack in exchange for Will. Beckett agreed and Jack was given over to Jones, who later sent Jack to the Dutchman's brig. The pirates would not surrender, however, and battle was inevitable.\n\nThe fleets of the two sides lined up, and Beckett ordered Jones to attack the Black Pearl and give no quarter. At that moment, a tremendous storm formed spontaneously, and Jones took it as a sign that Calypso had been released. The Pearl advanced into a massive maelstrom that had formed in between the two fleets. Despite the protests of Mercer, Jones steered the Flying Dutchman straight into the swirling vortex as the Pearl came in on the opposite side. Jones ordered the cannonneers to fire, and for several minutes, the two ships exchanged broadsides. A stray cannonball hit the quarterdeck, and all of the EITC soldiers near the helm were either killed or wounded. Jones had shielded Mercer from the blast, but took advantage of Mercer's moment of weakness, and suffocated him with his tentacles. He then took the key from Mercer's body and began to head to his organ room, where he would reclaim the chest, and his freedom.\n\nWhile descending the stairs, however, Jones spotted Jack Sparrow, out of the brig, with the chest in hand. As his crew appeared, Jones taunted Jack on his ironic situation. Jones then tried to seize the chest, but not before Sparrow grabbed a rope and escaped by ascending to one of the Dutchman's masts. Jones was able to teleport to Sparrow's location, where a sword fight between them followed in the ensuing battle.\n\nAlthough Jack managed to beat Jones in the sword fight by slicing off Jones' tentacle that held the key and disarming him, Jones was successful in breaking Jack's sword, taking the chest and knocking Sparrow off the mast. However, Sparrow still held onto the chest, and struggled to get back up. Jones then sent Sparrow flying, where he'd grab onto a rope. Swinging on the rope, Jack shot the chest from Jones' grip, sending it falling to the deck below.\n\nThe chest was taken by Will Turner, who boarded the Dutchman to help Jack, and ran to the other side of the ship until he was confronted by his father, Bootstrap Bill Turner. Jones came down, retrieved his sword and made his way through the battle on the Dutchman to get to the chest. He took down everything in his path, including EITC soldiers. As soon as he made towards the chest, Jack appeared, thereby continuing their duel. After Jones knocked Sparrow to the ground, he fought Elizabeth and quickly overpowered her by knocking her out with his massive crab arm.\n\nAs Davy Jones closed in for the kill, he was again interrupted, this time by Will Turner, who Jones also flung aside by kicking him with his crab leg. As the two lay on the deck desperately gazing at one another, Jones realized that they were in love, and decided to kill Turner to cause Swann pain and anguish. However, Sparrow intervened once again, and revealed to Jones that he had taken Jones' heart from the chest, and threatened to stab it with his broken sword. Jones perceived this as a bluff, and stabbed Turner in the heart anyway. Seeing that Jack couldn't stab his heart, Jones laughed at this seeming victory and watched as Elizabeth came next to Will.\n\nBut a grief-stricken Bootstrap Bill, after regaining his sanity, viciously attacked Jones like a crazed animal. Just as he finally gained the upper hand in his struggle with Bootstrap Bill, he yet again went for the kill. Jones then felt a horrible and foreboding pain in his chest, and turned to see his heart, pierced by a dying Will Turner with the help of Jack Sparrow. Davy Jones became dizzy and gazed up into the sky, calling out to Calypso, and finally falling into the darkness of the maelstrom, and his death.\n\nIt was implied that Davy Jones finally merged with Calypso, the sea that he had been in love with, and that he had found peace. With his death, Davy Jones was welcomed back into the dark embrace of the seas; for Calypso in her own way still loved him. His ship, the Flying Dutchman, received a new captain: Will Turner. However, approximately two decades after the battle of Calypso's maelstrom, Jones mysteriously reappeared alive and still under the curse of the Flying Dutchman. He walked on land and entered the house of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann who were finally reunited when the destruction of the Trident of Poseidon broke Will's curse. Jones slowly stepped into the Turners' bedroom and raised the crab-like claw on his left arm. The lightning woke Will who saw only the empty room and immediately returned to sleep, failing to notice barnacles and sea water on the floor.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Davy_Jones"}}

During a battle however, Pintel showed courage when alongside his partner in crime, Ragetti. Pintel also questioned the recently-acquired religious nature of Ragetti. One thing Pintel seemed to share with Ragetti, was a strong loyalty to Barbossa, switching allegiances from Jack Sparrow to Barbossa when he returned from death. Despite being loyal to Barbossa, Pintel held a great deal of respect for Sparrow, coming along on the journey to World's End out of this respect. He and Ragetti also felt uncomfortable about abandoning Jack a second time. He appeared to be very fond of the Black Pearl, as he kissed her hull and shouted words of encouragement while they were being pursued by the Flying Dutchman and showed visible anger at the damage dealt to the Pearl by the Kraken and the Dutchman.","Pintel's weapon was a cutlass which he used with some aptitude, namely alongside his friend and fellow pirate, Ragetti. Pintel also wielded on occasion a pistol, axe, and a knife."],"name":"Pintel","description":"Pintel was the brother of Ragetti's father. After he was lost at sea, Ragetti went to live with his uncle. One day, while drunk, they were both press-ganged into service by the British Royal Navy, but they did not take well to this life. After a year of beatings, bad food and boredom, both jumped ship and set themselves up as pirates in the Caribbean.\n\nBoth he and Ragetti soon joined the pirate crew of the Cobra, a small pirate schooner captained by Hector Barbossa. They served under Barbossa faithfully, participating in many pirate raids and battles at sea. But, at the end of the 1720s, the Cobra was attacked by another pirate ship, which was the clear violation of the Code of the Pirate Brethren.\n\nThe Cobra sank to the bottom of the ocean, and Pintel and Ragetti saved their captain, who almost drowned in a futile attempt to save his pet monkey, Polly. A few days later, Pintel and the surviving crewmembers found a deserted island, from which they were picked by the passing pirate ship. Pintel and his mates were taken to Tortuga, where they encountered Don Rafael, the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. After hearing Barbossa's story, Don Rafael took them all on his ship, the Venganza, and transported them to Shipwreck Island, where Barbossa repeated his story to the assembled Pirate Lords.\n\nDuring the next few months, Barbossa and his men stayed on the island. During that time, Pintel developed a certain attraction toward the prostitute Melinda, though she wasn't delighted with his company. Both Pintel and Ragetti were present at the Pirate Hall when the young pirate Jack Sparrow discovered that rogue pirates which sank their ship were led by none other than Boris Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea.\n\nSeven years later, both Pintel and Ragetti were at Tortuga the night Captain Jack Sparrow arrived there with the Black Pearl, looking for a crew to sail to Isla de Muerta and claim the lost treasure of Hernán Cortés. Pintel and Ragetti both joined Sparrow's crew, along with other pirates. On the Black Pearl, they were reunited with Hector Barbossa, who at that time served as the First Mate on the Pearl.\n\nThree days into the voyage, Pintel joined in a mutiny staged by Barbossa that left Jack marooned on Rumrunner's Isle, while the crew of the Black Pearl completed its journey. At Isla de Muerta, the treasure was found, and soon frittered away. It was only after having lost all 882 gold coins that the pirates came to believe the legend of the treasure's terrible curse: as punishment for their transgression, they had become undead, becoming skeletal-like beings in moonlight, but always unable to feel or taste anything. Only by returning all 882 pieces into the stone chest on Isla de Muerta, and giving the chest blood for every coin a pirate took, would the curse be lifted. Pintel was forced to remain with the crew until such a time as the curse was lifted.\n\nFor the next ten years, the crew of the Black Pearl raided settlements across the Seven Seas, tracking down all the pieces of treasure taken from the chest, with an odd ability to sense when a coin was near. If a coin hit water, a beacon would be sent out, and the pirates would be drawn to the spot. In the tenth year, Pintel and Ragetti joined the attack on Port Royal that would secure them the final piece.\n\nThe Black Pearl slipped quietly into the bay and opened fire on the city's fortress, Fort Charles. Pintel and Ragetti went ashore in one of the Pearl's boats and lead the attack on the Governor's mansion. The pirates hammered on the door, which was opened by the establishment's butler, whom Pintel greeted with an \" 'Ello, chum\" before shooting the unfortunate servant in the head. Storming into the foyer, Ragetti spotted Elizabeth Swann, the girl who possessed the coin. Pintel and Ragetti raced up the staircase and broke down the girl's bedroom door and tried to grab her, but she simply hit Pintel in the head with a bed warmer, and released the hot coals on Ragetti's head. The pursuit continued back down the stairs and into the dining room. Ragetti wanted to head out the open window, but Pintel knew she was still inside the room. They found her in a closet and were about to harm her when she invoked the right of parley, demanding to be taken before their Captain. Though Ragetti was not happy with this, Pintel knew this would greatly help their mission, and did as requested.\n\nOnboard the Black Pearl, Elizabeth told the crew that she was Elizabeth Turner, leading the crew to believe she was the daughter of \"Bootstrap Bill\", and thus her blood would help lift the curse. During the voyage back to Isla de Muerta, Pintel and Ragetti were ordered to present Elizabeth with a dress and Barbossa's request for her to dine with him. When given the choice between a clothed dinner with Barbossa, and a dinner nude amongst the crew, she quickly accepted Barbossa's proposal, much to Pintel and Ragetti's disappointment.\n\nAt Isla de Muerta, it was revealed that Elizabeth was not of the Turner bloodline when Pintel survived a shot by Barbossa, and Bo'sun blamed the mistake on Pintel and his partner. They defended themselves, and set out with the rest of the crew to track down the escaping Elizabeth. On the way, Ragetti spotted Jack Sparrow, believed to be dead. Sparrow informed Barbossa's crew he knew whose blood they really needed, and the pirates set off in pursuit of the HMS Interceptor. The Pearl swiftly caught up with the Interceptor, which clubhauled to deliver a full broadside attack on the Pearl. Pintel and Ragetti manned a cannon during the battle, firing a chain shot that brought down the Interceptor's main mast.\n\nThe battle was soon over, the medallion recaptured by Jack the monkey, and the surviving members of the Interceptor's crew were taken prisoner, including William Turner, whom Pintel and Ragetti escorted to the treasure cave at the island. Before the sacrifice could be completed, however, Jack Sparrow arrived once again, much to the amazement and disbelief of the crew. He told them that the Dauntless was waiting offshore to ambush the pirates. Pintel and Ragetti were chosen to distract the marines while the rest of the crew infiltrated the ship; they were forced to row in a boat wearing dresses, and holding umbrellas, to shield themselves from the moonlight. Although Ragetti took to the clever ruse, Pintel felt like a fool wearing a dress. Ragetti tried to ease Pintel\u2019s nerves by complimenting him on how \u201Cnice\u201D he looked, but this only annoyed Pintel even more. He angrily lunged at Ragetti, effectively knocking away both of their parasols, and revealing their true identities to the Royal Marines. By then, however, the cursed pirates had already sprung their assault, which Pintel and Ragetti soon joined.\n\nPintel and Ragetti rowed over to the Dauntless and climbed through a port hole. When the soldiers in the boats realized their ship was under attack, they rowed back toward the ship. Pintel and Ragetti manned one of the Dauntless' cannons and began to fire at the boats. Once the soldiers made it to the ship however, things began to go badly for the pirates. With the combined efforts of Will Turner and Jack Sparrow, the curse was lifted at the most inopportune moment. The Pearl was commandeered by the crew of the Interceptor after Elizabeth freed them, Barbossa was killed by Sparrow, and the pirates onboard the Dauntless became flesh again. Pintel and Ragetti were surrounded by Norrington's soldiers and placed under arrest along with the rest of the crew of the Pearl.\n\nPintel and Ragetti were taken back to Port Royal and tried for their crimes. They were able to escape, however, after Pintel coerced the Prison Dog into helping them. They acquired a longboat and set out to find the Black Pearl once more.\n\nPintel was astonished to find how religious Ragetti had become during his imprisonment. Pintel tried to convince Ragetti to return to piracy, but Ragetti remained steadfast, but eventually relented over time.\n\nPintel and Ragetti ultimately happened upon the Black Pearl around a year after their arrest, lying moored on the coast of Pelegosto. They set about readying the ship for launch, hoping to commandeer it themselves. However, its current crew soon returned after escaping from a tribe of Pelegostos warriors, and set sail with the would-be thieves. Ironicaly their attempt to steal the ship made it ready for a fast getaway rather than the long one that would've happened had the crew had to ready the ship. Captain Sparrow did not appear to mind their presence aboard, and accepted them as members of the crew\u2014though privately considered them, later along with James Norrington, as his most expendable crewmen. However, this may just be Sparrow's anger toward Pintel and Ragetti for the mutiny.\n\nThey accompanied Sparrow to a meeting with Tia Dalma. During this meeting, Pintel was made uneasy by all the talk of supernatural entities, such as Davy Jones and the Kraken. Pintel also expressed his opinion that mathematical sums were something that vexed all men, perhaps hinting that Pintel was not good at math.\n\nPintel and Ragetti journeyed with Sparrow to a uninhabited shoal, where they were confronted by Davy Jones and the crew of the Flying Dutchman. Sparrow was able to make a deal with Jones to deliver one hundred souls to him. The crew was saved, but their peril was far from over. The Pearl sailed to Tortuga, where Pintel and Ragetti gathered supplies for the ship, while their old captain gathered fresh crewman to deliver to Jones. Elizabeth Swann joined the crew, and was rather surprised to see her two antagonists aboard the Pearl again.\n\nFrom Tortuga, the crew set out to find the Dead Man's Chest, finally locating it on Isla Cruces. Sparrow told them to mind the boat when they came ashore, while Pintel complained about how Sparrow was treating him like a common servant. Upon seeing the sinking image of the Flying Dutchman, Pintel and Ragetti abandoned the boat and ran in fear to rejoin their comrades. They came up on a three-way duel between Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and James =Norrington over the chest of Davy Jones. Pintel was able to convince Ragetti to steal the chest in order to \u201Cremove temptation from their paths\u201D. They then ran off into the jungle, followed closely by Elizabeth, who eventually caught up to and confronted them. They were forced to fight a common enemy when Davy Jones' crewmen attacked, and the three improvised a surprising degree of teamwork with only two swords between them (Elizabeth's sword had been taken by Will earlier).\n\nPintel and Elizabeth made it back to the Black Pearl, only for the Flying Dutchman to rise from the depths and pursue the pirates. During the pursuit, Pintel kissed the Pearl's hull and gave words of encouragement to her in order to escape from the Dutchman. However, they were soon targeted by the Kraken. Pintel joined the battle, although he largely remained out of the way, even hiding in Sparrow\u2019s cabin at one point. Both he and Ragetti fled the ship while the Kraken dragged it and its captain to Davy Jones' Locker.\n\nPintel joined his new crew in lamenting the loss of Captain Jack Sparrow in Tia Dalma's shack. Tia Dalma suggested going to World's End, to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. Pintel agreed to embark on the quest along with all the other surviving crew. It transpired that this journey would be led by none other than Hector Barbossa, resurrected by Tia Dalma herself. Once more under the command of his former captain, Pintel and his fellow crew members traveled to Singapore, to convince the Pirate Lord Sao Feng to loan them a ship and crew, as well as steal the navigational charts to Davy Jones' Locker.\n\nWhile Barbossa and Elizabeth met with Feng, and Will searched for the charts, Pintel and the other crewmen swam underwater to a sewer opening. Although most of the crew wore coconuts on their heads to hide themselves, Pintel did not, due to his baldness, which made him visibly annoyed. While Tia Dalma distracted the locals, the crew cut through the bars of the sewer opening, and broke into Sao Feng's bath house. The crew secured the steam room, right below Feng's meeting with Barbossa. Ragetti excitedly tried to let Pintel look at something between the floor boards, but when Pintel looked through the cracks of the floor, a large man with a huge belly stood overhead. Pintel is disgusted, although Ragetti is confused by his expression.\n\nAs it happened, the meeting began to go sour, Will had been captured, so the crew popped weapons though the floor boards to Barbossa and Elizabeth. Before anything could happen, however, the East India Trading Company attacked the bath house. The crew destroyed a portion of the floor, killing several soldiers in the process. Pintel and the others then popped up and joined the battle. The battle raged out onto the streets, where the crew managed to receive the Hai Peng and the navigational charts. The crew then set off to World's End and Davy Jones' Locker.\n\nAfter sailing through a frozen landscape, and despite Ragetti\u2019s optimism, Pintel became perturbed by the immensely cold weather. The Hai Peng soon became lost, and Barbossa sailed the ship off the edge of the world. Pintel and the others washed up on a beach, but before they could begin their search for Sparrow, Tia Dalma assured that he was closer than they thought, and the Black Pearl appeared over a dune, and glided down into the sea, much to the crew's amazement. Jack Sparrow jumped off the ship to greet what he thought were hallucinations. When he realized that they were real, he recruited Tia Dalma, Gibbs, Cotton, Marty, and Sao Feng's men for his crew, leaving the others on the beach. Although Sparrow listed a reason for why he was leaving Ragetti, he simply grimaced at Pintel and walked off. Barbossa was able to get them on the Pearl by denying Sparrow the navigational charts.\n\nThe crew sailed through an endless sea, and encountered the souls of all those that die at sea. Some were floating in the water, and Ragetti suggested dropping a cannon ball on them. Before Pintel or Ragetti could do this however, Tia Dalma confronted them. She told them that the souls should be in the care of Davy Jones. She also told them that Davy Jones was once a man, not a monster. Sparrow finally figured out the clues in Feng's charts, and began rocking the ship so that it would capsize, and when the sun set, the Pearl would be propelled back into the living world. Pintel allowed Ragetti to tie themselves to the mast so that they would be right side up when the ship turned over. This seemed like a good plan at the time, but when the ship rose up into the living world, and a conflict broke out between Barbossa and Sparrow, Pintel became angry with Ragetti. By the time they became untied, the crew realized they had wet powder in their pistols. Pintel attempted to restart the conflict by suggesting using the handles of their pistols as clubs, but to no avail.\n\nThe Pearl sailed to an island to gather fresh water. Pintel and Ragetti discovered the dead Kraken on the beach, and began prodding it with a stick. Everyone else took this as an ominous sign. While examining the island's water supply, Sao Feng's men turned on them, and gave them to Sao Feng, who had come to capture the Pearl in his ship, the Empress. Will had apparently made a deal with Feng so he could get the Pearl. When Jack asked if anyone had come to save him from the Locker just because they missed him, Pintel was one of the ones who raised his hand, much to Sparrow's surprise. Feng betrayed Will however, and handed Jack over to Beckett, who had come in his ship, the HMS Endeavour. The Company seized the Pearl from Feng, who had been promised ownership, however, and Barbossa made a deal with the frustrated Feng, and gave him Elizabeth in return for aiding them in their escape. The Empress attacked the Endeavour, and the Pearl was able to escape with Jack. The crew then sailed to Shipwreck Cove, the meeting place of the Brethren Court.\n\nAt Shipwreck Cove, Pintel became privately disdainful of the Pirate Lords, unimpressed by their pieces of eight, which were not coins, but pieces of junk. One of Pintel\u2019s fellow crew members, Joshamee Gibbs, explained that when the first Pirate Lords met they were broke. When Pintel asked why they didn\u2019t change the names of their junk, Gibbs dismissed him, saying that nine pieces of whatever-we-happen-to-have-in-our-pockets-at-the-time, didn\u2019t sound very piratey.\n\nHe later participated in the decisive battle against Lord Beckett and the East India Trading Company around Calypso's maelstrom, and as always, he fought alongside Ragetti. They fired cannons throughout the battle and witnessed the wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann preceded over Barbossa.\n\nThe two saved Will Turner by firing Jack the Monkey into the face of Maccus who had Will cornered and later saved the Pearl from sinking by using a chain-shot to free the mast from where it jammed against the Flying Dutchman's. He survived the battle, and manned the cannons during the attack on the Endeavour, helping to destroy Beckett's ship.\n\nPintel remained onboard the Pearl when Barbossa commandeered it, leaving Jack Sparrow behind at Tortuga. Pintel and some other crewmen, felt guilty about leaving Jack Sparrow behind, and tried to get Barbossa's bearings to the Fountain of Youth. However, Sparrow had cut out a hole in Barbossa's map. His further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Pintel"}}

One night, he would join Cotton, who joined with a group of pirates as the Auctioneer led an auction on two wenches, Scarlett and Giselle. After accidentally shooting at the Pirate Code, a pirate named Mungard ordered the Code locked up and warned the crowd of pirates that if any of them speak a word of what occurred, that he would have their tongues. It was then that Cotton and his parrot assured Mungard that mum's the word.\n\nHowever, Mungard ended up cutting off Cotton's tongue, though it is unknown if Cotton's tongue was cut off before or after Cotton spilled the beans about Mungard. Unable to speak, Cotton would subsequently train his parrot how to use a large number of phrases to essentially talk for him. Although how Cotton, now a mute, achieved such a feat is unknown and no one was able to figure out how.\n\nDays later, Cotton and his parrot joined a large group of men, including Marty the dwarf, recruited by Joshamee Gibbs to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow. Gibbs informed Jack that Cotton was a mute, having had his tongue cut out and trained his parrot to talk for him. Cotton and his parrot participated in the voyage to save Elizabeth Swann from Hector Barbossa's cursed crew and retrieve the Black Pearl.\n\nThe parrot accompanied Cotton throughout his time onboard the Black Pearl, serving under Jack. During the search for the Dead Man's Chest, Cotton's parrot was the only one to escape capture by the Pelegostos, who made Jack their new chief until he and his crew escaped. Days afterwards, Cotton and his parrot survived the attacks of Davy Jones' pet the Kraken, though watched as Jack and the Pearl were both dragged to Davy Jones' Locker. The parrot also accompanied the crew, now under the command of the resurrected Barbossa, during the rescue of Jack Sparrow. Cotton's parrot also formed a partnership with Jack the Monkey, though faced a moment of parley when the monkey pointed a pistol at the parrot. After arriving to Shipwreck Island, when the time came for the pirates brought the fight to Cutler Beckett and his armada, the parrot flew away from Cotton. After the battle had ended, the parrot returned once again to his master's shoulder.\n\nCotton and his parrot remained aboard the Pearl when Barbossa stole the Black Pearl from Jack again, and continued to serve aboard the ship. Sometime later, the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by Blackbeard, attacked the Pearl. After the ship's defeat, Blackbeard had the Pearl turned into a ship in a bottle. Both Cotton's Parrot and Jack the monkey were inside the Pearl in a bottle. Jack Sparrow would later discover the bottle and gain possession of it, thanks to Joshamee Gibbs.\n\nAfter a long time, during the quest for the Trident of Poseidon, Jack Sparrow, with the help of Hector Barbossa, managed to restore the Pearl to her original size along with Jack the Monkey, but Cotton's Parrot didn't appear, leaving his fate unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Cotton%27s_Parrot"}}

Under moonlight, he and the crew became walking skeletons, and the undead men began their quest to return all eight hundred and eighty two gold coins to Isla de Muerta.\n\nKoehler and Twigg took part in the siege on Port Royal to obtain the final coin, and fought their way inside the Fort Charles prisons. There, they encountered Jack Sparrow, locked up by James Norrington, and made jokes at their former captain's expense.

Louis disguised his crew as longshoremen and were taking the ship's cargo for themselves. The plan was going well until Jean tripped and saw Louis' two left feet. The ship's crew attacked the pirates and managed to win their cargo back. During the fight, Constance, in the form of a cat, scratched Left-Foot Louis's face deeply enough to leave three scars. Louis promised that he would track down and kill Jean and Tumen as well as skin Constance alive.\n\nSometime before Jack Sparrow and his crew became interested in the Sword of Cortés, Louis visited the City of the Dead and took the Sword for himself.

At some point in his life, Philip became a working missionary in the Caribbean. He was later captured by Blackbeard's crewmen during a raid on a remote island, in which all the others on his ship were killed. But when Blackbeard tried to kill Philip, his beloved daughter Angelica stopped him, because she feared for Blackbeard's soul if he committed such an act. And so Philip was lashed onto the mast of the Queen Anne's Revenge. Despite this painful ordeal, the missionary still managed to cling onto his most precious effect\u2014his holy Bible. Philip would still be held captive during Blackbeard's search for the Fountain of Youth.\n\nBy the time Jack Sparrow was forced aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Philip was tied to the Revenges mast, clinging on to his Holy Bible. During the mutiny on the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jack and Salaman went to save Philip. When Salaman said that Philip will be either with them or against them, he refused to join either sides of the fight. After the mutiny was foiled by Blackbeard, which was done by hanging all of the mutineers with the rigging, Blackbeard attempted to kill Jack for leading the mutiny and to make sure everybody wouldn't forget him.\n\nBut before Blackbeard could do it, Philip bursts in, calling him a coward, saying that nobody would forget him, no matter how many men he'd kill. Angered by Philip's courage to insult him, Blackbeard attempted to shoot Philip, but was stopped once again by Angelica, as she wanted to save her father's soul. Seemingly touched by his own daughter's wish, believing that every soul could be saved, Blackbeard asked Philip if what Angelica said was true. Philip told him it was, though believed Blackbeard as a longshot, saying that he'd pray for the souls aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. Blackbeard put away his pistol, touched by Angelica's faith. When Blackbeard ordered the Cook to row away on a longboat, he prepared to fire the Greek fire cannons on him as punishment. Philip tried to change Blackbeard's mind on this matter and spare the Cook's life, but was too late as the Cook was burning alive.\n\nAs the longboat was burning on open ocean, Blackbeard told to Philip that he felt closest to our Maker when he saw suffering, pain and anguish, saying it's when the true design of the world is revealed. Philip disagreed, saying he sees it when in times of hardship and tragedy, kindness and compassion are shown to those in need. Blackbeard then suggested Philip prayed the Cook to remain unharmed. Philip once again tries to change Blackbeard's mind, but was once again unsuccessful as Blackbeard had the cannons fired again.\n\nThe Queen Anne's Revenge soon made sail to the Whitecap Bay, to capture a mermaid for the Profane Ritual. Blackbeard had Philip, Scrum, Ezekiel, the Cabin Boy, Derrick, Purser and Gunner, were grouped together in a longboat. Scrum and the other crewmen were forced by Gunner to sing in order to attract the mermaids. When Tamara and other mermaids appeared, Scrum started to get close to her to kiss, despite warnings from Philip and the other crewmen to not. As Tamara showed her true form to Scrum, the mermaids then began to attack.\n\nThroughout the mermaid attack, the crewmen's longboat was destroyed as well as Derrick and Purser being killed. Philip was able to swim back to the island along with some of the other crew members. As he got up, the bay's lighthouse exploded. While the debris fell, a mermaid saved Philip by pulling him out of the way. When he got up, he found the mermaid and stabbed her in the tail fin as he believed he was being attacked, an act he later regretted deeply. When he saw her scared, bleeding and trembling, Philip pulled the sword out, but before she could escape, Blackbeard and his crewmen captured her with a net as she hissed. Philip regretfully took credit for the mermaid's capture.\n\nPhilip would later travel with the crew to the island in their search for the Fountain of Youth. While journeying through dense jungle and swamps, Philip would follow the captured mermaid who was carried in a glass coffin filled with water by some of the crewmen. Philip later conversed with Jack Sparrow about converting as the pirate asked if he could be welcomed to Heaven. The missionary then noticed that the mermaid was dying because of lack of oxygen. He told the Quartermaster to open the coffin, but he refused. Philip then takes the Quartermaster's sword and breaks the lock on the tank, showing what he said to be true as the mermaid immediately gasped for air. As the Quartermaster pulled back his sword, Philip quickly shoved his Bible in its place.\n\nLater, after witnessing Blackbeard nearly killing Angelica and Jack jumping off a chasm, the crew continued on through the jungles. As they made way, the crew dropped the tank and the mermaid spilled out of it and, because of no water, transforming into her human form. Philip gave her his shirt to cover her nudity. Blackbeard ordered the mermaid to walk. However, the mermaid was unable to walk, and so Blackbeard threatened her by saying to walk or die. To save her from being killed by the Quartermaster, Philip offered to carry her through the journey.\n\nAs they made it to another resting point, Philip started to talk to the mermaid about her beauty, though he saw her kind as deadly as he believed she attacked him. But the mermaid denied that claim as she saw Philip as different from other men, saying that he protects. It was that moment when Philip realised that she saved him at Whitecap Bay. Blackbeard ordered to bring the mermaid and cover her head, calling her a \"creature\", Philip yelled angrily that the mermaid did have a name. Blackbeard waited for Philip to tell it. Though he did not know her true name, Philip said that her name was \"Syrena\".\n\nPhilip accompanied the crew arrived to the Jungle Pools, where mermaids had been bound and left to die. Syrena was put into one of the pools while Blackbeard tried to force her to cry. However, Syrena would not yield. Before Blackbeard could decide whether or not to torture her, Philip stepped in to try and stop Blackbeard. Philip told Blackbeard that his soul couldn't be saved and that Syrena was worth more than a hundred of him. Upon learning that she and Philip fancy each other, Blackbeard exploited their love by threatening to kill Philip. As Syrena watched helpless, either unable or refusing to slip a tear, Blackbeard ordered the Quartermaster to kill Philip, despite Angelica's pleas. Although in reality he only sedated him with a voodoo dart. Syrena was seemingly left to die while Philip's body was dumped nearby.\n\nPhilip regained consciousness, not knowing how or why, and immediately ran to free Syrena. Though she was shocked at first in seeing that he was alive, Philip's deed of freeing her and having told her that she is kind and compassionate, caused Syrena to cry a tear of joy. Blackbeard and his crew immediately came to get the tear from Syrena. After getting Syrena's tear in a vial, Blackbeard ordered Syrena to be secured and left at the pools to die. Knowing that he would rebel, Blackbeard ordered his men to tie Philip's hands and he was forced to go with them to find the Fountain of Youth.\n\nBounded and with no way to escape to save Syrena, Philip continued to travel with Blackbeard until the crew met with Jack Sparrow. The crew continued to search for the Fountain of Youth. The search finally reached its end as they journeyed into a blue cave where the entrance to the Fountain was.\n\nFinally reaching the Fountain, the crew's perilous quest was over. But before Blackbeard could taste the water from the Fountain, Hector Barbossa and his crew appeared to arrest Blackbeard. With Blackbeard not wanting to go down without a fight, a battle ensued between the pirates and the British. When the Quartermaster killed one of the British soldiers, Philip tried to use the dead soldier's sword to cut free of his bonds. As he cut, the Cabin Boy appeared and freed him before continuing to fight. As Philip got up, he was suddenly run through the stomach by one of the British soldiers.\n\nPhilip clutched the wound and, avoiding the battle, ran away to the Jungle Pools to free Syrena from the same fate that other mermaids endured at the pools. Philip believed Syrena dead, but said to God that if she was taken, she must come back. Syrena regained consciousness and swiftly disappeared under water leaving Philip wounded and alone.\n\nAlone and mortally wounded, Philip drags himself to the nearest pool to get some water to drink and use to try and heal his wounds. As he splashes the water, Syrena returned and appeared in front of him. Reunited and free from Blackbeard and his crew, the two profess their love once more. Syrena then told Philip that she could save him from dying. Philip then begged Syrena for forgiveness for all the trouble he brought to her, as she would never have been captured had it not been for him. Syrena kissed Philip, confirming the legend that a mermaid's kiss prevents drowning by giving him the ability to breathe underwater, and pulls him into the pool. Philip was taken by Syrena as they swim through the pools to freedom. His further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Philip_Swift"}}

Residing in a palace in India, presumably Bombay, Sumbhajee used the honorific \"Sri\" and was known as a Hindu Priest. Sri Sumbhajee was one of many who assembled at Shipwreck Cove for the meeting of the Fourth Brethren Court.","Sumbhajee acted very regally, dressing finely and having others speak for him, both due to his own superiority complex, and his high-pitched voice. He was also very wise and intelligent, earning both the respect and trust of fellow Pirate Lord, Capitaine Chevalle.","Sumbhajee possessed both a pistol and a sword. He also had a unique piece of eight, as did all the Pirate Lords. His piece was a snuff box fashioned from a calf-horn on a string, which he kept on his person at all times. It was destroyed with the other pieces of eight during the freeing of Calypso."],"name":"Sumbhajee Angria","description":"Not much is known about Sumbhajee's early life, except that he was the son of Kanhoji Angria, the notorious Indian privateer who fought against the East India Trading Company for most of his life. At some point in his life, Sumbhajee became a Hindu priest, but left to gain his fortune as a pirate.\n\nSri Sumbhajee eventually became the Pirate Lord of the Indian Ocean, and disrupted trade between Europe and India by plundering rich merchant ships, particularly those belonging to the East India Trading Company. He owned many vessels, his favorite being the Otter, due to its ability to slip in and out of ports quickly, without being noticed by Company ships. He was widely feared due to the belief that he had supernatural powers.\n\nThe Company placed a bounty on his head, dead or alive, for crimes including piracy in the Indian Ocean, levying his own taxes, blockading the port of Bombay, and creating his own currency. The bounty was unusually low for his direct actions against the Company, and was only worth 2,800 guineas.\n\nOn one occasion, the infamous adventurer Jack Sparrow stole Sumbhajee's ruby. Some time later, Sumbhajee came into possession of one of the vials of Shadow Gold, a mystical elixir which was said to have strange powers. When Jack came with his crew for the vial, Sumbhajee demanded the ruby. Though Jack gave him the ruby, Sumbhajee wasn't ready to give up the Shadow Gold so easily.\n\nIn the 1740s, Sumbhajee answered the summons sent out by Hector Barbossa, and traveled to Shipwreck Cove, to attend the fourth meeting of the Brethren Court. The night before the meeting, however, Sumbhajee went to the Cutlass Tavern and became drunk. While in his drunken stupor, a pirate thug named \"Stupid\" Barnaby stole Sri Sumbhajee's piece of eight, and made off toward his base in the slums. Jack Sparrow would later arrive to Shipwreck Cove, and was sent by Captain Edward Teague to help him out. He then related to Sparrow that he had been robbed and sent him to the Cutlass Tavern to investigate. Sparrow identified and found the thief and then later returned to Sumbhajee victorious, having bested Barnaby in a duel, with the piece in hand. With his piece returned, Sumbhajee went to the Pirate Hall to attend the meeting.\n\nDuring the meeting, Sri Sumbhajee remained silent, only using his aides to speak his mind, whispering in their ears or signaling to them. Sumbhajee supported Elizabeth Swann's idea of going to war with the East India Trading Company, but did not think electing a Pirate King to declare war, as the code dictated, was necessary, possibly because he knew that the Pirate Lords always voted for themselves. He signaled to Askay, who relayed his message against the code. Askay was then shot for his insolence by Captain Teague, Keeper of the Code. Sumbhajee then complied, and participated in the vote, using his other aide, Pusasn, to inform the Brethren that he was voting for himself. Elizabeth Swann won however, and she then declared war on the East India Trading Company. Sumbhajee broke his silence at this point saying (in an extremely high voice), \"And so, we shall go to war!\"\n\nThe Brethren then exited the hall anxiously, but were confronted by soldiers of the East India Trading Company, led by Black Coats who had infiltrated Shipwreck City on behalf of Lord Cutler Beckett, the Governor of the East India Trading Company. Sumbhajee and Ammand the Corsair were trapped in the Tavern Square, and were able to defeat their enemies with the assistance of Jack Sparrow. Sumbhajee then made it to the Otter, and departed with the rest of the fleet.\n\nUnfortunately the Brethren's small fleet were confronted by Beckett's entire armada lay before them. Realizing it was too late to retreat, King Swann, Jack Sparrow, and Hector Barbossa attempted to parley with the Company. No agreement was reached however, and the battle was iminent. King Swann ordered the fleet to raise the colours, and Sri Sumbhajee ordered his flag to be raised and gazed over the sea with dark forboding. Soon after this the skies darkened and a storm formed around the fleet and a massive maelstrom formed in between the two fleets, perhaps as Sumbhajee had percieved. Sri Sumbhajee and his crew watched as Hector Barbossa's ship, the Black Pearl, entered maelstrom to fight the Flying Dutchman. After the battle, Sumbhajee and his crew celebrated the Brethren's victory, as the armada broke apart following the deaths of Davy Jones and Lord Beckett.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sumbhajee_Angria"}}

He also had great respect for the Pirate Code, as it provided him the leverage in his sells."],"name":"Auctioneer","description":"Not much is known about the Auctioneer's early life, but it is known that he took a life of piracy. He spent many years as a pirate in the Caribbean, using Shipwreck Island as his base of operations. He joined many pirate expeditions against the Spanish settlements in the New World. The Auctioneer had a head for business, and he started selling stolen goods to pirates of Shipwreck City. He even established trade routes between Shipwreck Island and distant countries like Peru.\n\nOne day, the Auctioneer joined the pirate crew of the Wicked Wench and participated in the Pirate Captain's raid on Isla Tesoro. After the battle, he was selling women exclusively taken from Puerto Dorado. The Auctioneer and his two assistants set up the auction near a canteen called \"La Cantina\", which directly overlooked the waterfront. The auction itself took place in front of the \"Mercado\". During the auction, the Auctioneer presented a \"winsome wench\" until a group of drunken pirates chanted that they wanted the \"redhead\". As the Auctioneer's group of potential clients became more rowdy, one of his assistants fired a warning shot to keep them at bay. When offered six bottles of rum for a bride, the Auctioneer loudly proclaimed that he would accept only gold. When the \"Red Head\" began to show her leg seductively to the on-looking crowd of excited pirates, the Auctioneer demanded she cover herself up saying; \"Strike your colors you brazen wench! No need to expose your superstructure!\"\n\nThe Auctioneer would soon transport his operations into Shipwreck Cove. At some point during his time there, he met with Captain Jack Sparrow, who offered him two wenches that he could sale fair and square: Scarlett and Giselle. And so the Auctioneer planned to auction the two unsuspecting wenches on the very night where both wenches believed they were to marry Jack Sparrow.\n\nAs the wenches Scarlett and Giselle realized they were both deceived, the Auctioneer entered the room and began the auction to a group of pirates. He started with Giselle, giving her a flower bouquet, with the bid of 20 pieces of silver. The Marquis D'avis and some others, including a drunk pirate named Gregor, would bid for Scarlett, whom they would refer to as the \"redhead\". Seeing that Scarlett was a very profitable venture, with the bid having gone up to forty, the Auctioneer took the flower bouquet from Giselle and gave it to Scarlett.\n\nThroughout the auction, the bidding went from forty to fifty and sixty. Scarlett and Giselle would bicker throughout the bid, over who was worth more in the auction, eventually to a point where they start fighting each other. The Auctioneer stared in horror as the two wenches fought, fearing that he wouldn't get the profit from them. He was corrected, however, as the Marquis D'avis began the bid anew by bidding 200 for the pair. With the bid going to his favor, the Auctioneer offered Scarlett and Giselle as a great deal.\n\nAs the two wenches continued to fight, the bidding went higher. By the time the bid went up to 400, a group of pirates, led by Atencio, formed a corporation. As the bid went over 600, a pirate named Nigel bidded his goat, which caused Atencio to insert a goat in his bid. The bidding would conclude with the Marquis D'avis making the final bid with seven hundred and two goats, which the Auctioneer gladly accepted.\n\nAs Scarlett and Giselle expressed their happiness for being rich and having goats, the Auctioneer corrected them by saying he has the goats as he shackled the two wenches together, stating that he owned them in a fair one-hundred percentage. Then an argument began, pirates and wenches alike, on if Scarlett and Giselle were for sale or not. The Auctioneer stated that he traded them fair and square, quoting what was in the Pirate Code, after which Mungard reminded the group of pirates that the Code was the law.\n\nAs all the pirates wondered what would happen next, Giselle asked the Auctioneer if he owned the stocking that she wore or a song she might sing, in which he confirmed undoubtedly. It was then that Giselle gave Mungard a hard slap on the face, which then caused a stir between the group of pirates. An angry Mungard vowed that the Auctioneer would pay and then pointed his pistol at the Auctioneer. Fearing for his life, the Auctioneer began a toss of the key to Scarlett and Giselle's shackles, with the holder whom Mungard would point his pistol at. The key would go from Nigel to Atencio and then the Marquis D'avis, who then tossed the key to the Auctioneer, who was once again threatened by Mungard.\n\nIn this confusion, Gregor accidentally fired his pistol, ricocheting his pistol into the air; thereby causing another stir. The crowd gasped as Mungard turned around with his pistols. The Auctioneer, holding the Code on him, stated that this madness was the doing of Jack Sparrow. Hearing the name Sparrow, Mungard turned around asking where as his pistol fired; in which the bullet hit the Code. The Auctioneer, still holding the Code, fell backwards to the ground. Everyone, including Mungard, stared in shock of what just happened.\n\nThe pirates whisper among themselves about Mungard shooting the Code, in which one of them saying that Captain Teague would have his head. Mungard then ordered the Auctioneer to be taken out of here. A group of men, including the Auctioneer's assistant, helped get the Code off of a dazed Auctioneer, who blabbered about a shipment of Peruvian llamas. Mungard then ordered the Code to be locked up and warned the crowd of pirates that if any of them speak a word of what occurred, that he would have their tongues. The Auctioneer's further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Auctioneer"}}

His career as a pirate began while he was working on a sloop as a first mate. During a trip from Jamaica to Providence , the ship was taken by a pirate Captain Christopher Winter. Soon after, he gained pirates confidence and became one of them. He changed his name to Edward England to cover his tracks from the colonial authorities.\n\nIn 1718, the Bahamas were brought under British rule by Woodes Rogers. Captain England made his escape to the African coast and the Azores and Cape Verde Islands, where he and his fleet captured several vessels themselves. Captain England traded his sloop for a larger vessel, the Pearl which he renamed the Royal James.\n\nHe returned to Africa in the spring of 1719, and on the way to the Cape of Good Hope took ten more ships, three of which they released after plundering, and four of which they burned. They kept two of the ships for their own pirate fleet, the Mercury and the Katherine. These two ships left England's fleet and headed for the Caribbean, and England took two more ships, the Peterborough and the Victory, of which he kept only the latter.\n\nEdward England and his mate John Taylor sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and into the Indian Ocean, after careening in Madagascar. In 1720, it was from there that England exchanged the Royal James for a new flagship - the Fancy, a newly captured thirty-four gun Dutch ship.\n\nEngland and Taylor returned to Madagascar in August 1720, where they got into a conflict with a Dutch ship and an English ship belonging to the East India Trading Company. Taylor took on the Dutch vessel, while England pursued the English one, until its captain James MacRae ran it aground. The cargo of Cassandra, taken by England, was valued at £75,000. However, this booty came at a cost of ninety deaths aboard the Fancy. For this catastrophe, Taylor wanted revenge upon the now-ashore crew of the Cassandra, but England decided to let the men sail away on the Fancy. This caused Taylor to lead a mutiny, during which he had Captain England and three others marooned upon the island of Mauritius, near Madagascar.

One night, he would join a group of pirates as the Auctioneer led an auction on two wenches, Scarlett and Giselle. Throughout the bidding, the pirates would bid for Scarlett, who he would refer to as the \"redhead\". Atencio would be one of the few pirates who would bid for Giselle, known as the \"one with the flaxen hair\" or the \"non-redheaded\". Though Atencio formed a corporation with a group of pirates, he lost the bid to the Marquis D'avis.\n\nThere was soon an argument on whether the wenches were for sale or not, in which the Auctioneer quoted what was in the Pirate Code.

His parents incurred the wrath of Hera when they fostered the young god Dionysos. His father was driven into a murderous rage by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. His mother Ino fled with Melikertes in her arms, after her husband had killed their other children, and fleeing leapt off the cliffs into the sea. There the pair were transformed into sea-gods and received the names Palaimon and Leucothea.\n\nFor many centuries to come, Palaimon would lure sailors to his island, then use his magical powers to drain them of their souls so he could keep himself young for all eternity. However, one day his luck ran out. The Spanish Armada managed to capture him, and he was taken aboard the fishing vessel Delfin. Trapped and shackled, Palaimon couldn't escape, but he used his powers to devour the souls of the ship's crewmen. Seeing this, the crews of the rest of the ships in the fleet opened fire on the Delfin, destroying it completely. Though the Spaniards believed that Palaimon is dead, he managed to survive, clinging to a piece of floating wood.\n\nSome time after the destruction of the Delfin, Palaimon's unconscious body was discovered by the pirate crew of the Black Pearl and, believing he was only a boy, was taken on board. After he woke up, the boy had a dinner in the captain's cabin, talking with the ship's captain, Hector Barbossa. When Barbossa asked the boy what made him so valuable to turn the Spaniards against themselves, Palaimon claimed he knew the location of the Fountain of Youth, introducing himself as Juan Ponce de León. Though Barbossa didn't believe him at first, Palaimon offered to take him to the legendary spring in exchange for safe passage home.\n\nOnce the Black Pearl arrived at their destination, an island, \"Mr. De Leon\" revealed his true colors. Palaimon summoned an army of souls to fight against Barbossa's undead pirates, while he himself engaged in a fierce duel with Barbossa. Against the odds, Barbossa was able to defeat Palaimon by forcing him to fall into the sea, deducing that he couldn't swim due to having found him clinging to a piece of floating wood and that his altar showing him riding a dolphin.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Palaimon"}}

Her father, Hector Barbossa left her to an orphanage after her mother's death. It is likely she was a baby then. She was left outside the orphanage with a diary with a ruby on it and a name, \"Carina Smyth\". Inside of the diary there were many important astronomy dates who could lead her to the trident of Poseidon.\n\nWhile on the voyage to Saint Martin, Carina used information in the Diary for constructing an Occhiolino, an invention of Galileo Galilei's. The Occhiolino had \"the power to uncover 'the secret of things' for whomever uses it,\" which she took to mean a magnifying aid. Carina finished completing the device when her ship arrived at Saint Martin, using a doorknob given her by the ship's cook as the last piece. While explaining the function of the device to the disinterested cook, Carina was overheard by two local thieves, Gan and Jan, who stole subsequently stole it from her.\n\nLoosing them in the crowd, Carina berated herself for talking about the Occhiolino out loud, until she observed unusual carriage tracks. The deeper ruts indicated that two men had boarded it while it passed. Catching up to the carriage, owned by a couple named George and Margaret, Carina found that Gan and Jan had were indeed inside. She demanded the return of the Occhiolino. When the thieves pulled guns, the shots alarmed the horses, causing the carriage to careen out out of control. Carina managed to reclaim the Occhiolino, but Jan stole her journal when he and Gan jumped the carriage prior to it running off a bridge.\n\nHaving lost her most precious possession and unsure of where the thieves had fled to, Carina used the Occhiolino to examine a torn piece of Jan's shirt, discovering pieces of peppercorn on it. Using that clue, Carina found them in a spice shop discussing what to do with their prize. Carina confronted them a second time to claim her property. While the theives had lost their pistols, they still had swords. However, the swords flew through the air for Carina to catch them.\n\nBelieving that she was using witchcraft, Gan and Jan fled, leaving Carina her journal. In the process of their escape, they stepped on and broke the Occhiolino. While sad that the magnifier was ruined, Carina was relieved to have her journal back.\n\nA young girl who had witnessed the scene assumed that that Carina was, in fact a witch, made herself known, asking to be taught. Carina revealed that it was actually science; she had used magnets to make the metal swords fly out of their owner's hands. Giving the magnets to the girl and reminding her of how science can improve lives, Carina resumed her mission.\n\nWanting to find Swift and Sons Chart House for supplies she would need to study the blood moon that would lead her to the Map That No Man Can Read, Carina asked a solider for directions. When the solider scoffed to know why she, as a woman, would want to find that establishment, Carina made the mistake of telling the truth; that she was a scientist and had been studying the stars her whole life. Immediately branded as a witch, she was forced to flee, spending weeks on the run while evading and getting into skirmishes with the authorities until she was finally captured.\n\nCarina is visited by someone and while talking she confesses that she managed to trick the lock before she escapes the cell and runs out.\n\nCarina later disguises herself as a nun and approaches the arrested Henry Turner and asked him for information about the Trident of Poseidon. Though she disbelieves his story with dealing with the dead, she says he must help her before she frees him and runs after being recognized. Both of them are then chased by British soldiers and go their separate ways for the time being.\n\nCarina managed to elude the guards by hiding in an astronomer's shop where she worked with the equipment inside before she is found by the shop's owner. He accuses her of being a witch which she defends until Jack Sparrow arrives and helped her in eluding the guards though she screams at the pirate for his actions. Carina then runs away but is soon captured by the guards sentenced to execution for her \"crimes\".\n\nAt the execution site, Carina was to be hanged and after being asked to speak her last words. Carina used them to insult the crowd for their stupidity by stating she was astronomer but her speech was cut off by the recently captured Jack Sparrow resulting in an argument which ends with her telling the executioners to kill him first. However, their bickering annoyed the crowd who demanded for both their deaths at the same but Henry Turner arrived distracting the guards before Jack's crew arrived. Carina kicked her executioner off the platform just as Scrum who was fighting a guard arrives nearly knocks the lever to the rope down. After Scrum defeats the guard she thanks him but accidentally releases it. Carina falls through but is saved by Henry who catches her and asks for her aid in his quest which she reluctantly agrees. John Scarfield tries to shoot Henry so both of them would die, but they are saved by Jack and Henry frees Carina. With the pirates, Carina flees the area.\n\nMaking their way to the Dying Gull, Carina criticized the ship which was still ashore but stopped the ship prepared to set sail though they have a hitch, the ship makes its voyage.\n\nDuring the journey, Jack has Carina serve as navigator with her maps threatening the life of Henry if she doesn't comply aware she might have feeling for him. Jack has his men throw Henry overboard and after he gets the information, he reveals Henry was thrown in a lifeboat tied to the ship to Carina's irritation.\n\nWhen the Silent Mary started to pursue them, Carina called the pirates stupid for believing in ghosts and was mad when Jack allowed his crew to lead a mutiny against him. On a rowboat, she is still annoyed and before reaching land Carina decided to save herself and discarded her dress having realized that the men on the other ship were after Jack and dived into the water.\n\nMaking it ashore, she sees Armando Salazar and horde of undead soldiers becoming terrified at the sight of ghosts and realizing they were real. At a lost of words of seeing the supernatural, Carina ran into the forest where she was caught in a net.\n\nAs Carina called out for help, she saw Henry and Jack approach her and asked to free her but they were captured as well. Afterwards, three men arrived and knocked out Jack while taking him and his companions to their leader Pig Kelly. When Jake awoke, he found Carina and Henry tied up as Kelly forced Jack who owed him a large debt to marry his sister Beatrice Kelly. Jack was unwilling to do so even under the threat of death but inadvertently said \"I do\" once Carina and Henry pointed out it wasn't legal.\n\nHowever, before the kiss can occur, the wedding is halted by the arrival of Hector Barbossa who dispatches Kelly and his men freeing Carina and her companions. Barbossa then used Sword of Triton to release the Black Pearl from imprisonment in a bottle as Carina watched in awe as the ship grew to its natural size.\n\nUpon Barbossa establishing captaincy of the vessel, Carina and Henry were tied to the wooden stand for ship's bell. As the ship sailed, Carina's warned Barbossa that his maps were incomplete but her pleas were ignored though Henry supported her. However, after some time he realized he needed her help so he released her and Henry allowing Carina to take the helm to locate the Black rock island by using the stars as a map.\n\nAs she guided the ship, Carina listed all the unbelievable things she has witnessed with ghosts and a shrunken ship that grew to natural size, stating there was no scientific explanation that could explain this. Henry arrived telling her all the myths of the sea were real jokingly telling her to admit that she was wrong but Carina retorted she merely had doubts. Henry called her out on this apology but she stated he had to apologize for putting her in danger with said myths as Henry stated were something she now believed in apologizing for which she accepted causing him to realized he walked into her hands and leaves as she stated he saw things her way.\n\nCarina continued sailing as Barbossa approached her, he notices that Smyth was carrying the diary of Galileo Galilei, an object that he had once possessed. While discussing its origin with Smyth and how she got it from her father, she slapped him after he mentions the ruby was stolen and her father was a thief. Carina defended her father as a man of science as Barbossa realized that she was named after the star known as Carina and walked off.\n\nVery soon, the Essex approached intent on attacking but they were easily wiped out by the Silent Mary who attacked the crew. In the midst of the battle,\n\nAfter the discovery of the Trident of Poseidon, caused by the sea splitting in half, Carina was able to remind Henry on how to break all the curses at sea. After Henry was able to break the Trident, Salazar and his entire crew turned back into their human forms, but soon realized that the split sea was slowly coming to a close, and they were right in the middle. When all had seemed lost, Carina noticed Barbossa swinging in from the Pearl's anchor, urging them all to climb.\n\nAfter climbing aboard, she was able to slowly make her way up, but would soon loose her grasp of the anchor and began falling back down toward the sea. Fortunately, Barbossa was able to catch her just before she fell any further. Looking into the eyes of her savior and seeing his ruby tattoo, she asked him who she is to him. Barbossa replied that she was \"Treasure\" as she finally realized who she was and who was holding her by her arm, she couldn't help but know that she had finally found what had been lost to her for so many years, her father.\n\nAs Barbossa held on to her, he noticed that Salazar was making his way toward Carina with his sword drawn. After ordering his daughter to grab hold of the anchor, Jack tossed Hector a sword and he let go of the anchor, allowing himself to fall and pierce Salazar through the back with his blade, causing the Spaniard to fall down to the depths of the sea, but not before landing face first on the anchor and dragging his remaining crew down with him. As Carina stared into the eyes of her father she watched helplessly as he fell toward the colliding waters below. After gazing at each other one last time, Barbossa was consumed by the sea, out of Carina's sight.\n\nStill comprehending what was happening, she was given little time to think, for the sea then closed in on her, Henry and Jack. The crew of the Black Pearl raised the anchor and out came the three heroes from the water. As Carina made her way aboard the Pearl, all began to sink in. Her eyes filled with tears as she was finally able to piece everything together and comprehend what had just happened. As the entire crew mourned the sacrifice of Hector Barbossa, Carina knew that for a moment she had everything, only for it to be gone again. Jack soon gave Henry carina's diary so he could give it to her. She accepted the gesture since the book was given to her by her father as Henry called her \"Miss Smyth\" she corrected him, and told him that her name was \"Barbossa\".\n\nThe sea had finally been tamed. All was calm as they sailed back to Henry's home, where he tried to kiss her though she slapped him for it thinking he was still possessed. He forgives her and kisses her, a sentiment she returns. She then watches as Henry met with his father after years of not seeing him. Carina stood beside Henry as they both grasped hands as Henry's mother emerged from the hills and ran towards her husband. Carina and Henry smiled at the two finally being able to reunite after so long. Her further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Carina_Smyth"}}

But the expedition was captured by slave hunters, and she became a slave known as Ayisha. After being sold to a British family in Calabar, she was bought by Cutler Beckett, the East India Trading Company Director for West Africa who intended to use her to find the treasure of Zerzura."],"name":"Amenirdis","description":"Princess Amenirdis was born and raised in the city of Zerzura. She lived in the royal palace with her family. She possessed one of the three sacred bracelets needed to enter the labyrinth beneath the temple of Apedemak. Her bracelet gave her the power to see through illusions and create ones of her own. Her bracelet could also be disguised as a simple piece of cloth. She was also given a eunuch bodyguard Tarek, who was very fond of her and protected her at all times.\n\nWhen Amenirdis was fifteen years old, her father left the hidden island to find the cure for her younger brother's sickness. A year later, her other younger brother, Shabako, also left the island in search of their father who never returned. After four years, neither Amenirdis' brother nor her father returned. Amenirdis then led an expedition to the ancient city of Kerma. There she hoped to make an offering to the god Apedemak in the most ancient temple and Apedemak may reveal where her lost family was. However, when they reached the ancient city, south of the third cataract of the Nile, all they found were ruins. Before they could leave, they were captured by slave hunters who had pistols and muskets, the weapons still unknown to the people of Kerma. Before she was taken captive, the high priest Piye and her bodyguard, Tarek, helped her create an illusion so that she was less noticeable. She used the power granted to her by the bracelet to make her appear as a hideous old woman. Piye, Tarek, and Amenirdis were then captured by the slave hunters and brought to Calabar to be sold.\n\nTo prevent anyone from recognizing her true identity as a princess and holding her for a high ransom, she changed her name to Ayisha.\n\nThe slave hunter who captured Ayisha was named Ancona Wren-John. He confiscated her jewelry (with the exception of her sacred bracelet) and kept it with him and sold them. Later, Ian Mercer, one of Cutler Beckett's operatives, discovered the jewelry and brought the owner to Beckett, who recognized that it belongs to a Zerzuran princess. Beckett bought the jewelry in hope that it would help him find the island of Kerma. He went to Wren-John see if he had the princess as a slave. Wren-John tells him that the only remaining slave from that hunt was a ugly women, Ayisha. Ayisha was working at the Dalton Plantation along with Tarek. Beckett then offered the Daltons a very high price for her.\n\nAlthough Ayisha secretly knew English, she hardly ever spoke in Calabar. She continued to save up coins in order to be able to run away back to her homeland. However, she did not need to spend her money on a ship because Beckett, who was desperate for her to tell him the location of Kerma, instructed Jack Sparrow to take her on board the Wicked Wench and convince her into giving him the headings. Ayisha, however, knew of their plan before they met at the market. Ayisha continued to remain disguised and did not speak English. Jack spoke with Ayisha through Chamba, who knew both pidgin and English. Jack told her that he will take her home to her island. Ayisha agreed only if they also take along Tarek, her body guard.\n\nOnce they were out at sea, Ayisha told Jack that she will not give him the heading to Kerma unless he sailed to the New World to rescue her brother, Shabako, from slavery. Jack accidentally took her scarf, which held together her illusion, revealing her true self. Jack, who met her father, Taharka right before he died, realized that Ayisha is actually Princess Amenirdis. He agreed to rescue Shabako so that they may gain the other sacred bracelet.\n\nAfter rescuing Shabako from a plantation in New Avalon, the Wicked Wench ran into the infamous rogue pirate ship, the Koldunya. During the attack, Ayisha blew up the powder magazine of the Koldunya and led the Wench to victory.\n\nAfter the battle, Esmeralda's ship, the Venganza, assisted the Wench in recovering from their tough battle. Ayisha quickly became jealous of Jack and Esmeralda's relationship. When Jack asked her what was troubling her, they kissed for the first time. Esmeralda invited Ayisha over for dinner on her ship and they became good friends. After Esmeralda and her crew left, Ayisha and Jack spent more time together and quickly formed a romance.\n\nJack Sparrow faithfully returned Amenirdis and Shabako to their home. The Wicked Wench was followed by La Vipère, because Christophe-Julien de Rapièr had one of the bracelets which were needed to open the gates of the Zerzuran Labyrinth. Amenirdis led them through the enchantments to the hidden island. Upon their arrival, there was a great homecoming feast. Jack, Chamba, and Robby Greene were invited to the feast and Jack first met Queen Tiyy. The next day, Shabako, the heir to the throne, announced in a speech that all the slaves in Kerma shall be freed in one year. He also named Princess Amenirids the Grand Vizer of Kerma, the first woman to ever fill that position. Amenirids accepted her position and agreed to help free the slaves, motivated by her time as a slave.\n\nThe following day of the emancipation, she led Christophe and Jack into the labyrinth of Zerzura to allow them to take some treasure as promised. However, the party reached some troubles in their adventure through the maze because unfortunately no one in Zerzura knew the sacred word that will help vanish illusions and monsters of the four elements of the universe: earth, water, air, and fire. However before hand Amenirdis had made a list with all the possible sacred words and after must guess she found that the word was Sekhmet, the cat goddess. When she, Jack, and Christophe reached the center of the labyrinth, Jack ran up to and swiped the Heart of Zerzura, feigning betrayal to Amenirdis, who played along for Christophe's sake. Christophe takes Amenirdis hostage and threatens to kill her, so Jack gives him the fake Heart of Zerzura that Amenirdis created. When the god, Apedemak appears to attack them, Christophe escapes and Jack faints. Amenirdis bows to and thanks her god, agreeing with him that Jack is a good man who wouldn't take the real Heart.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Amenirdis"}}

During the battle off the coast of the Devil's Triangle, he stood at the helm of the Silent Mary, following his Captain's orders no matter the cost. After nine pirate vessels had been defeated, Lesaro noticed pirates floating on driftwood in the water, begging for mercy. He informed his Captain of the survivors, who condemned them all to death. After receiving his orders, Lesaro ordered a line to fire on the remaining pirates begging for mercy in the water with little concern, killing them all.\n\nLesaro's loyalty eventually cost him his life when their ship sailed into the Devil's Triangle, due to the witty Jack Sparrow. As Salazar pushed Lesaro away from the helm in an attempt to maneuver the bootleg turn from the Wicked Wench, the Silent Mary crashed on the rocks below, causing the ship's powder magazine to go up in flames and send the vessel sinking to the depths of the ocean, killing Lesaro, as well as Salazar in the process. Lesaro, along with the entire crew of the Silent Mary was resurrected by the supernatural powers of the Triangle. with his crew mates as the undead.

As cannon balls battered the stone walls of the Fort Charles, dithering Governor Swann quaked with fear at every blast. The cursed pirates storm into the governor's mansion, taking his daughter Elizabeth as captive. Days after launching a search mission for his daughter, Governor Swann and Commodore Norrington found Elizabeth marooned on a desert island with Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who threatened her before. Governor Swann took part in the skirmish with the cursed pirates aboard the Dauntless. About a year later, Weatherby Swann had to help secure the freedom of Elizabeth and her fiancé Will Turner, who were arrested by Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company on their wedding day. After helping her escape prison, Governor Swann reluctantly gave his loyalty to the Company, and by extension, Lord Beckett. Weatherby had since been searching for Elizabeth for months, traveling with Beckett in hopes of finding her before she was caught and executed as a pirate.","Appointed by the King of England, Weatherby Swann was the proud Governor of the British colony at Port Royal on the vibrant and prosperous island of Jamaica. Death warrants drawn up await Governor Swann's signature before executions could proceed. Undoubtedly Swann was charming and polite but it was no secret that he hadn't the skill to govern his rebellious daughter Elizabeth, let alone an entire island. Although Governor Swann claimed that everyone was bound by the law, he was still willing to break the law to keep Elizabeth safe, helping her escape from prison when she was sentenced to be executed. At first Weatherby hated pirates but after discovering that Elizabeth was in love with Will Turner, he grew more accepting of them, realizing that not all pirates were bloodthirsty savages. Governor Swann even considered that Jack Sparrow had more honor than Cutler Beckett, who used Swann's political connections to further his own cause. When he last saw his daughter when he entered the realm of the dead, he told her he was very proud of her.","As a member of the British high society, Weatherby Swann possesed a ceremonial sword. However, it is unknown if he ever used it in battle. He was seen wearing it on a day of James Norrington's promotion ceremony and on his daughter's interrupted wedding. When the cursed crew attacked the Dauntless, Swann used a candlestick to hit the arm of a cursed pirate after it came off and had a life all of its own."],"name":"Weatherby Swann","description":"Not much is known of Weatherby Swann's early life, only that he was born in Great Britain. He married an unknown female and raised a daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in London, England. Prior to the Swann family sailing on the crossing from England, Weatherby's wife died. Since the death of his wife, Governor Swann had raised his daughter Elizabeth on his own, despite her growing fascination of pirates. He also met Cutler Beckett, the ambitious official of the East India Trading Company.\n\nSometime during the 1720s, King George I appointed Weatherby Swann as the governor of the British colony at Port Royal, the colonial capital of Jamaica located in the central Caribbean. The Swanns made the crossing from England aboard the HMS Dauntless, under the command of Lieutenant James Norrington. Although Elizabeth expressed her fascination for the subject of pirates, much to her father's dismay, both Lieutenant Norrington and Governor Swann showed their concern, with Norrington stating that he intended to see all pirates get \"a short drop and a sudden stop\". The passengers of the Dauntless happened upon the burning wreckage of a merchant vessel. Although Lieutenant Norrington believed this to be the work of the powder magazine, Joshamee Gibbs took it to be the work of pirates, though Governor Swann only took it as an accident. When the crew rescued Will Turner, a survivor from his pirate attack, Weatherby told Elizabeth to care for the half-drowned boy.\n\nAfter arriving to the town of Port Royal, Will Turner became a blacksmith apprentice while Weatherby Swann and his daughter Elizabeth lived in a grand mansion set in the fashionable St. Paul's district, far from the squalor of Port Royal's docks and slums. Governor Swann and Norrington would become friends during their time in Port Royal, and Norrington proved to be highly loyal to the Governor, putting down Port Royal's rise through his efforts.\n\nEight years after sailing the crossing from England, Captain James Norrington, one of the Lieutenants on board the Dauntless during the crossing, was promoted to commodore. Governor Swann had arranged a ceremonial sword to be made, to be delivered by blacksmith Will Turner. On the morning of Norrington's promotion ceremony, Governor Swann gave Elizabeth a dress, said to be the latest fashion in London, which he hoped for her to wear for the ceremony. As they rode towards the ceremony, Governor Swann expressed his hope that Elizabeth would demonstrate a bit more decorum in the presence of Commodore Norrington for all he had done with the town of Port Royal. Governor Swann and Elizabeth attended the promotion ceremony at Fort Charles, during which Norrington proposed to Elizabeth. Shocked, and finding it difficult to breathe in a corset her father had insisted she wear, Elizabeth fell from the fort's battlements, but was rescued from a watery grave by Captain Jack Sparrow.\n\nDespite the fact that Sparrow had saved his daughter's life, Weatherby ordered him to be shot, then called for a hanging when Norrington revealed he was branded as a pirate. After the infamous pirate held Elizabeth as hostage, Jack managed to escape Norrington's clutches despite being manacled. Norrington was later able to capture Sparrow, though it would not be the Swanns' last encounter with the Captain.\n\nThat night, Swann's cozy world was turned upside down when the Black Pearl launched an attack on Port Royal. As Governor Swann and Commodore Norrington walked along the far wall of Fort Charles, speaking very briefly about Norrington's proposal to Elizabeth, they both hear cannon fire in the distance, prompting the commodore to tackle the governor to the ground seconds before a cannonball impacted right next to them. Weatherby witnessed the opening stages of the battle from the Fort Charles, though the fort's garrison found it hard to defend itself. As cannonballs battered the stone walls of the fort, the ramparts were no place for dithering Governor Swann, who quaked with fear at every blast. Ultimately Commodore Norrington ordered Swann to barricade himself in his office.\n\nLured by the Aztec gold medallion that Elizabeth wore around her neck, a band of pirates stormed the Governor's mansion. By the time Governor Swann returned to his wrecked home, his beautiful daughter was kidnapped and sailing away from the port, a captive of Hector Barbossa. The next morning, Governor Swann assisted Norrington in formulating a plan to rescue her. Ultimately, the Royal Navy dispatched its vessels in a sweep of the Caribbean, and Weatherby joined Norrington aboard the Dauntless.\n\nMarooned with on a desert island with Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth burned his stock of rum. The huge fire alerted the Navy and the two were rescued the next morning. Climbing aboard the Dauntless, Elizabeth revealed that Hector Barbossa planned to sacrifice Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner at Isla de Muerta. Despite his daughter's pleadings, Weatherby refused to condone a rescue mission, stating that the boy was responsible for his own actions, having engaged in the act of piracy. However, Elizabeth was able to persuade Norrington otherwise, and Weatherby accompanied the Navy forces to Isla de Muerta.\n\nOn board the Dauntless, the Commodore ordered Elizabeth to remain in the captain's quarters and out of harm's way. But Governor Swann, while talking to his daughter, underestimated her spirit and determination and discovered that she has escaped using knotted bedsheets so she can help Will. Weatherby Swann was in the process of leaving to report Elizabeth's escape, only to be greeted by the sight of a marine being stabbed repeatedly with his own musket by a skeletal pirate: the cursed crew had sneaked aboard the Dauntless to overcome its crew by surprise. Horrified, Swann slammed the door and hid. He was soon discovered by a bloodthirsty skeletal pirate and only just escaped his grasp, though the pirate managed to grab the governor's wig. Engaging in a tug of war over the hairpiece, Swann seized a nearby candlestick and brought it down on the arm holding the wig. But Swann's ordeal wasn't over; to his horror, the arm of his cursed assailant came off and had a life all of its own. Armed with the candlestick, Weatherby was forced to fight against the skeletal arm, managing to briefly beat it into submission. However, it sprang back to life and attempted to attack him again when he picked it up, though he was able to shut it inside a dresser drawer. Even then, the arm still resisted, and the trembling Governor was forced to hold the drawer shut as the entire dresser shook with the appendage's efforts to free itself. When the dresser stopped shaking, the Governor opened the drawer to investigate, and promptly slammed it shut again in horror: the arm had turned into a very real (severed) human limb. At the same time, cries of \"huzzah!\" rang out from the decks and Swann was delighted to see why: the pirates' curse was lifted and the Dauntless was back in British hands. The Governor promptly joined in the celebrations on deck, shaking his finger at a nearby pirate in a scolding fashion. The rescue mission had been a success, and on the return voyage to Port Royal, Weatherby offered Turner clemency if he did not interfere in Jack Sparrow's fate\u2014as the pirate, in Norrington's custody, was set for execution at the fort.\n\nTurner, however, disregarded this, and staged a rescue attempt at the fort that ended in a confrontation on the battlements. Norrington was set to hang Turner as well as Sparrow, but when Elizabeth decided to stand by Will in opposition of Norrington, Weatherby ordered the marines surrounding them to stand down. Sparrow escaped, and Elizabeth professed her love for Will. Weatherby was concerned over his daughter's choice, but nevertheless accepted it.\n\nSome time after Sparrow's escape, Weatherby went on a long overseas journey. During his absence, Port Royal suffered an attack from Jolly Roger, an undead pirate captain. The attack was unsuccessful, but Weatherby offered a reward of 1,000 doubloons for Roger's head, and heads of all his undead officers and crewmembers. But that didn't stop Roger from attacking other islands and ports in his war. It was said that during this time, he was once spotted drinkin' rum and ale at the Rowdy Rooster tavern acting like Jack Sparrow.\n\nAbout a year after the battle of Isla de Muerta, Elizabeth and Will were set to be married, and, despite Norrington's disgrace some time earlier, Weatherby Swann remained Governor of Port Royal. However, the peace was upset by the arrival of Lord Cutler Beckett, with whom Swann had previous dealings with. Beckett bore arrest warrants for Elizabeth, Will and Norrington, and though Will was later released as part of a bargain with Beckett, Elizabeth remained locked up despite Weatherby's best efforts. Both he and Will visited Elizabeth in the prison to inform her of Will's deal with Beckett to recover Jack Sparrow's compass, though Swann was reluctant to follow it. When he was accosted by the soldier on watch and addressed as \"Mr. Swann\", he quickly told him that he was still the governor: \"Do you I wear this wig to keep my head warm?\". Ultimately, Weatherby felt his duty as a father took precedence over his duty as Governor, and freed Elizabeth from jail and attempted to send her back to England, having procured passage with an old friend, Captain Hawkins, to whom he gave a letter for the King. However, this action had been foreseen by Beckett, who dispatched his aide Ian Mercer to intercept Weatherby, murdering Hawkins in the process. The Governor was caught, though his daughter managed to slip away.\n\nAnimosity grew between Swann and Beckett, though the latter decided to keep Swann in his position as Governor, if only to ensure Beckett's superiors in England received good reports from the Governor's office. Beckett ultimately forced Swann to choose between his daughter and his own life when he revealed his ships were in pursuit of Elizabeth and her colleagues. Only Weatherby's loyalty to the East India Trading Company would ensure her continued survival. Weatherby, defeated, accepted.\n\nWith the capture of the heart of Davy Jones, Lord Cutler Beckett's fleet expanded upon the acquisition of the Flying Dutchman, the East India Trading Company became a far more dangerous and potent threat in the Caribbean. For months, Governor Swann had been searching for his daughter Elizabeth, ever since he helped her escape her cell in Port Royal and realized she fled into the dark night. Weatherby knew she would have gone to find Will Turner and Jack Sparrow among the pirates. But since that night, he had not seen nor heard from her. By traveling with Lord Beckett and the newly-appointed Admiral James Norrington, he had hoped to find her before she was caught and executed as a pirate.\n\nAlthough he was reaching breaking point, Weatherby Swann continued to serve Beckett, having joined him aboard the Endeavour and at least one visit aboard the Flying Dutchman after it had destroyed a fleet of pirate ships. Through unknown circumstances, he became curious about the Davy Jones' heart and soon discovered its secret. Upon learning this from Mercer, Beckett realized the Governor's loyalty was short-lived and, with Beckett's increased power, knew that his usefulness had run its course. So in order to keep their secret, Beckett and Mercer had Weatherby Swann killed through obscure means.\n\nSwann's spirit entered the realm of the dead, where it encountered Elizabeth and the rest of her crewmates, having journeyed into Davy Jones' Locker to rescue Jack Sparrow and the Black Pearl. Weatherby was concerned that Elizabeth had died, though when she assured him otherwise, stated that he believed he himself had. He told her what he had learned about the heart, thus giving the recently-rescued Jack the information for his initial plans for immortality. Elizabeth attempted to save him, though Weatherby was by now beyond rescue. As he disappeared into the mists, Weatherby promised to give Elizabeth's love to her mother, with whom the hapless Governor would soon be reunited. As Weatherby's boat sailed on into the mist, Tia Dalma assured that he was at peace.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Weatherby_Swann"}}

He became known as Gombo because he was an excellent chef. One day he lead a slave revolt in Jocard's tobacco plant, killing his master; however he was forced to flee due to the guards. He was intercepted by Captain Jack Sparrow on his way out who offered him a spot on the Black Pearl (as the chef). A few months later he was discovered by the slaves whom he had helped escape who were now pirates requesting that he be their captain. Jocard agreed and sailed off with them.\n\nFor the next few months Jocard sailed about becoming one of the most infamous pirates about, until he got word that Captain Edward Teague was hosting a Pirate Lord. Believing him to be King Samuel, Jocard attacked Libertalia, only to discover the Pirate Lord was Captain Jack Sparrow. Together they attacked King Samuel for they both wanted something from him (Shadow Gold for Captain Jack and Samuel's life for Jocard). The raid on Samuel's fort was a success and Jocard stole Samuel's Piece of Eight from him, becoming Pirate Lord of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nJocard ran afoul of Davy Jones, and, whether it was by debt, or death by Kraken, he was imprisoned in Davy Jones' Locker. Jocard was soon captured within the Locker by another trapped pirate, Black Bart, who imprisoned him on board his vessel. Jocard lost all hope of being free, until another imprisoned Pirate Lord, Jack Sparrow, tracked Jocard down and dueled Black Bart. Sparrow won the duel, and he then freed Jocard from his cell. It is unknown how Jocard escaped the Locker, as he was not onboard the Black Pearl when it escaped, and neither did he have the mysterious navigational charts of Sao Feng.\n\nJocard did escape, though, and he was reunited with his crew. He then traveled to Shipwreck Cove, to join in the fourth meeting of the Brethren Court. At the meeting, Jocard was against Hector Barbossa's idea of releasing Calypso, since he believed that if she was the Court's enemy in the past she would be the Court's enemy when released. He also suggested that the Brethren cut out Barbossa's tongue for suggesting the idea. During the vote for a new Pirate King, Jocard voted for himself, but was defeated by Elizabeth Swann, who then declared war on the East India Trading Company.\n\nThe East India Trading Company was the first to attack however, and they sent a force of Black Coats against them. Jocard was able to escape the chaos, and made it safely to his ship. He then sailed with the rest of the fleet, to meet the Company's armada in battle. Jocard and his crew became discontented when they saw that they were outnumbered ten to one. After the two fleets parleyed on a sandbar, the battle began. A large maelstrom formed in between the two fleets, and the Black Pearl, and the Flying Dutchman went forward to battle within the huge whirlpool. The Pearl won, and with the destruction of the HMS Endeavour, the rest of the Company's armada dispersed into the distance.

Despite the attempts of the British and Portuguese to subdue Angria, he remained undefeated until his death. He was also the father of Sumbhajee Angria, the Pirate Lord of the Indian Ocean."],"name":"Kanhoji Angria","description":"Born in the village Harne in Ratnagiri district of Konkan in the year of 1669, he was born into a Sankapal family, whose original name was Kadu. They were guardians of small state named 'Vir Rana Sank' and therefore became known as Sankapal. Little is known about his early life except that he was involved in daring exploits at sea. He spent much of his childhood in the fort at Suvarnadurg, of which he would later become governor.\n\nHe was originally appointed as Darya-Saranga by the chief of Satara in 1698 . Under that authority, he was master of the Western coast of India from Bombay to Vingoria, except for the property of the Muslim Siddis of Janjira who were affiliated with the powerful Mughal Empire.\n\nKanhoji initially started by attacking merchant ships of the East India Trading Company and slowly gained respect from the sovereign and notoriety with the colonial powers. When Maratha Chattrapati Shahu ascended the leadership of the Maratha kingdom, he appointed Balaji Viswanath Bhatt as his Senakarta (Commander) and negotiated an agreement with Angria around 1707. This was partly to appease Angria who supported the other ruler who claimed the Maratha throne, Tarabai. Under the agreement, Angria became head of the Maratha navy.\n\nHe also played a role in the Maratha conflicts against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who was campaigning in the Deccan.\n\nKanhoji intensified the attacks on colonial naval powers like Great Britain and Portugal on the western coast of India. On 4 November 1712, his navy even succeeded in capturing the armed yacht Algerine of the British President of Mumbai, William Aislabie, killing the chief of their Karwar factory, Thomas Chown, and making his wife a prisoner. The yacht and the lady were released on 13 February 1713 for a ransom of 30,000 Rupees. He also signed a treaty with the President Aislabie to stop harassing the Company's fleet. Mr. Aislabie departed for England during October 1715.\n\nAfter the arrival of Charles Boone as the new Governor of Bombay on 26 December 1715, Boone made several attempts to capture Angria. But instead in 1718 Angre captured three ships belonging to the British leaving them to claim that Kanhoji Angreia was a pirate. Angre blockaded the port of Bombay, and extracted a ransom of 8,750 pounds from the East India Company.\n\nThe British launched a fresh campaign in 1720, when shells from floating batteries burst in vain against the rocks of Vijaydurg fort. The attempt to land inside the fort ended in disaster, and the British squadron soon retired to Bombay.\n\nOn 29 November 1721 a joint attempt by the Portuguese (Viceroy Francisco José de Sampaio e Castro) and the British (General Robert Cowan) to humble Kanhoji also failed miserably. This fleet consisted of 6,000 soldiers in no less than four Man of war ships led by Commander Thomas Mathews. Aided by Maratha warriors Mendhaji Bhatkar and Mainak Bhandari in his navy, he continued to harass and plunder the European ships. Commander Matthews returned to Great Britain, but was accused and convicted of trading with the pirates in December 1723. Also, during 1723, Governor Boone returned to Great Britain. After Boone's departure for a few years for some unknown reasons relative calm prevailed among the British and Angria, until his death.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Kanhoji_Angria"}}

Upon learning that Jack Sparrow was allegedly recruiting a crew to undertake a voyage to the Fountain of Youth, they attempted to enlist the elusive pirate. Usually, the King and his policy makers would not strike a deal with a common pirate like Jack, but these were exceptional times. And so, after arresting him outside of St. James's Palace, the King's Royal Guards literally dragged Jack into the dining room of the palace, where he would meet with King George and his advisors. The King would be accompanied by both Lord John Carteret and Prime Minister Henry Pelham.\n\nThe meeting began with much confusion as to whether or not he was the \"real\" Jack Sparrow. Getting to the matter at hand, Pelham asked Jack if he had a map, after which Carteret immediately said that they should confiscate it and send him to the gallows. After Jack told them that he had lost the map, Pelham and Carteret asked him if he knew the route to the Fountain well enough to guide an expedition, to which Jack inquired if they were to provide a ship and crew. He was then introduced to the peg-legged captain of the expedition: Hector Barbossa. After Jack and Barbossa had a brief reunion, in which Jack would be restrained by two guards, King George then resumed the matter of Barbossa completing his mission before the Spanish succeeded.\n\nIt was at that moment that Jack Sparrow made one of his legendary escapes while surrounded by royal guards. The King was pulled back as Jack ran across the banqueting table, while Carteret cowered behind the King's seat. Jack eventually grabbed onto the chandelier above the table and swung across the room, leaving the King and all of his advisors to stare in shock and disbelief. After Jack's escape, the King sent Barbossa to continue their mission aboard the HMS Providence, but in the end, although the British didn't realize their true intentions, the Spanish were successful in their mission to destroy the Fountain of Youth.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/John_Carteret"}}

He combined his forces with the Ottoman Empire to control the region from Morocco to Turkey and sometimes beyond. He would sometimes sail into the Adriatic Sea, and would in turn earn the wrath of fellow Pirate Lord, Captain Villanueva, who presided over those waters. The Barbary Corsairs often battled Villanueva's Spanish Treasure Fleet, who patrolled the waters of the Adriatic.\n\nAmmand was wanted dead or alive by the East India Trading Company for crimes including those against the church, theft of church property, assaulting a nun, and piracy along the Barbary Coast. The reward was 4,400 guineas.\n\nAmmand responded to the summons sent out by Hector Barbossa, and convened with the other Pirate Lords at Shipwreck City. Although, once there, Ammand had a change of heart, and refused to attend the meeting of the Brethren Court. Jack Sparrow was sent by Captain Teague to find and convince him to return. Ammand was stubborn however, and duel erupted. Despite having one of his crewmen throw coconuts at Sparrow, Ammand was eventually defeated, and grudgingly attended the meeting.\n\nAt the meeting, Ammand became angry at Captain Barbossa when he suggested that the Brethren should release the sea goddess Calypso, Ammand even proposed shooting him for his suggestion. Otherwise, Ammand was very quiet during the meeting, most likely due to the fact that he had been forced to attend in the first place. When the Brethren voted for a new Pirate King, Ammand voted for himself. He was defeated in this however, and Elizabeth Swann was made King. She then declared war on the East India Trading Company, which was attempting (and succeeding) to eliminate piracy once and for all.\n\nThe East India Trading Company was ahead of them however, and a small force of Black Coats infiltrated Shipwreck Cove, with dozens of Blue Coat soldiers behind them. The task force separated the Pirate Lords from each other and attacked. Ammand and Sri Sumbhajee held out in the Tavern Square. With the assistant of their fellow pirates and Jack Sparrow, they were able to defeat the troops that came against them. Ammand and his crew then boarded the Seref and set out along with the rest of the Brethren that set out to meet the ship of the Governor of the East India Trading Company, Lord Cutler Beckett, and the Flying Dutchman.\n\nUnfortunately for the Brethren Court, the Endeavour and the Dutchman were not the only ships set against them, and Beckett's entire armada lay before them. Realizing it was too late to retreat, King Swann and two diplomats were sent to parley with Beckett. Apparently this had no impact, and the battle seemed inevitable. King Swann ordered the fleet to hoist their colours, and Ammand proudly and eagerly hoisted his flag, ready for battle. Soon after this, however, the skies darkened and a storm formed around them and a massive maelstrom formed in between the two fleets. Ammand and his crew watched as Hector Barbossa's ship, the Black Pearl, went into the maelstrom to fight the East India Trading Company's flagship, the Flying Dutchman. They then later celebrated after the defeat of the Dutchman's captain, Davy Jones, and Lord Beckett himself, Ammand doing a little dance.

The daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth played the part of the perfect governor's daughter but secretly Port Royal society bored her. She dreamed instead of a life of adventure. Even as a young woman, she never forgot the moment as a child when she glimpsed a pirate ship, the Black Pearl on her voyage from England to the Caribbean.

At some point in Elizabeth's childhood, her mother died and Weatherby Swann began raising his daughter on his own, even after he became Governor. As a child, Elizabeth gained interest in the subject of piracy, romanticizing them in her obsession, believing that it would be \"exciting to meet a pirate.\" Elizabeth still held that belief when she sang a song about pirates on-board the HMS Dauntless, en route to the Caribbean.\n\nWhile the Dauntless sailed through the Caribbean Sea, young Elizabeth Swann was singing the pirate shanty until one of the sailors, Joshamee Gibbs, warned her about the superstition of singing about pirates in an unnatural fog before Lieutenant James Norrington intervened. Although Elizabeth expressed her fascination for the subject of piracy, both Norrington and Governor Swann showed their concern, with Norrington stating that he intended to see all pirates get \"a short drop and a sudden stop\". Shortly afterwards, Elizabeth discovered a young boy, lying unconscious atop a floating piece of driftwood, the only survivor of a pirate attack on a merchant vessel.\n\nAs Norrington's men searched the burning wreckage, Governor Swann asked Elizabeth to watch over the boy, which she did dutifully. When the boy roused, Elizabeth learned his name, Will Turner, before he slipped back into unconsciousness. Elizabeth then noticed a gold medallion, with a skull, about Will's neck. Fearing he was a pirate, Elizabeth took the medallion from Will, so that the ship's crew would not suspect that he was associated with pirates. As Elizabeth stood alone on the stern of the Dauntless, taking a look at the medallion, she caught movement out of the corner of her eye. Looking up, she caught a glimpse of a pirate ship, the Black Pearl, hoisting a flag with a skull, moving silently through the thick fog. This moment would haunt Elizabeth for the next eight years, never forgetting it. Little did she know what adventures would stem from this fateful encounter, and the trouble the medallion would bring.\n\nUpon arriving to the British colony at Port Royal on the vibrant and prosperous island of Jamaica, Governor Swann set himself up in a mansion overlooking the harbor town. Elizabeth made her home there also, while Will started work at a blacksmith's forge in the town. He and Elizabeth became good friends over the next eight years, although Elizabeth's high status appeared to draw a divide between them, making Will reluctant to show his true feelings for her. Both had fallen in love, but neither were prepared to admit it. Over the years, Elizabeth blossomed into a beautiful young lady, although drove her father to distraction with her willfulness and disregard for propriety.\n\nEight years after they first met, both Elizabeth and Will had both grown up, and Elizabeth still carried the medallion with her. She attended James Norrington's promotion ceremony at Fort Charles, wearing a corset that was far too tight for her (a recent gift from her father, all the latest fashion in London), and spent much of the time trying to keep herself from fainting. After the ceremony, James asked for a moment alone with Elizabeth out on the battlements, during which he proposed to her, having realized that all he was missing in his life was marriage to a fine woman. Elizabeth was surprised, and this, coupled with the constricting corset, caused her to faint and topple over the battlements. She plunged into the water far below, narrowly missing the rocks, and sank to the sea bed. As she sank, and unknown to her, the medallion sent out a ripple, confusing Mullroy and Murtogg who were on the Interceptor.\n\nFortunately for her, Captain Jack Sparrow had arrived in Port Royal, and, witnessing Elizabeth's fall, dived into the water to save her. Bringing her up to the dock, Sparrow cut off her corset, and Elizabeth took a gulp of welcome fresh air. Sparrow also noticed her medallion, and seemed highly interested in it. Before he could say more, Norrington and his men arrived to arrest the pirate, despite Elizabeth's protests. However, Jack suddenly turned on Elizabeth, holding her hostage while his effects were returned to him, before making a spectacular escape. Shaken, Elizabeth returned to the mansion, where she reflected on the day's harrowing, yet exciting, events.\n\nThat night, at the Governor's mansion, a maid named Estrella removed a bed warmer from the fireplace and slid it between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed. Estrella and Elizabeth briefly discussed the events of that day\u2014during which Elizabeth had been rescued and subsequently threatened by Jack Sparrow, though got into the subject of Commodore Norrington's earlier proposal to her. Finally noting suggestively, Elizabeth's affection for Will Turner, rather than James Norrington, Estrella left the room. Elizabeth began reading a book, toying absently with the medallion around her neck until the flame from her lamp diminished and went out, and the room went dark.\n\nShortly afterwards, Elizabeth's cozy world was turned upside down when the Black Pearl launched an attack on Port Royal. Lured by the Gold Medallion that Elizabeth wore around her neck, detected after the ripple was sent out, the pirates storm the governor's mansion. Elizabeth was chased through the mansion by Pintel and Ragetti, and was unable to defend herself with a sword, as it was stuck in the ornamental shield. Fortunately, she was able to request parley before they could harm her. However, this seemed to please Pintel, who stated he would honor the Code of the Brethren if it meant Elizabeth would go to their captain without a fuss.\n\nWhen Elizabeth was taken aboard the Black Pearl, she was there to negotiate with Captain Hector Barbossa. While talking to Barbossa, she used the gold medallion to strike a bargain. Her threat to drop it overboard made the captain cooperate. Believing the pirates would hold her for ransom if they knew she was the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth gave her surname as \"Turner\", claiming she was a maid in the Governor's household. This seemed to greatly interest the pirates, though they appeared more taken with her medallion. She traded it in exchange for a ceasefire, resulting in the pirates leaving Port Royal with Elizabeth still on board. She protested, but Barbossa explained three flaws in her negotiations, most importantly that she failed to mention her return to shore in the negotiations, finally finishing by welcoming her aboard. With no choice, Elizabeth sailed from the port, still on board as a captive of Barbossa.\n\nLater, Elizabeth was invited to dine with Barbossa in the captain's cabin of the Pearl. Barbossa proceeded to relay the tale of Hernán Cortés and the cursed Aztec gold. Elizabeth, a pragmatic woman, firmly refused to believe the \"ghost story\" about Barbossa and his crewmen being cursed men. Although, during her attempt to escape his clutches, she stabbed him in the chest with a knife\u2014only to find it neither killed nor even hurt him. Shocked, she stumbled out of the captain's cabin and into a nightmare, as the crew were revealed by the moonlight in their true, skeletal forms. In Elizabeth's dreams of an adventurous life, she did not imagine herself being tossed in the air by a crew of skeletons. After her terrifying chase around the moonlit deck of the Black Pearl, she spent the rest of the night cowering in a corner of Barbossa's cabin.\n\nUpon arrival at Isla de Muerta, Elizabeth reluctantly sailed into the treasure-filled caves with the cursed crew. In the cave, she saw the Chest of Cortés and was forced to take part in a blood ritual. After a rousing speech, Barbossa attempted to lift the curse by returning the final cursed coin into the chest, with a portion of Elizabeth's blood\u2014believing it to be the blood of a Turner. The ritual failed, and Barbossa asked Elizabeth if her father was William Turner, and she told him \"No\". When refusing to reveal who and where Turner's real child was, Barbossa knocked Elizabeth to the ground. Fortunately for Elizabeth, while Barbossa and his crew were arguing, Will arrived in time to flee the island with her and his medallion.\n\nShe was brought aboard the HMS Interceptor and was shocked to find more pirates, though the friendly face of Joshamee Gibbs set her slightly at ease. But a challenge brought out the best in Elizabeth. The Interceptor was summarily pursued by the Black Pearl. She took command by helping the crew devise stalling tactics to aid their escape, such as trying to outrun the Pearl in some nearby shoals, and later ordered the crew to perform a clubhauling maneuver to take the fight to the Pearl. As the ship turned for attack, Elizabeth shouts \"Fire all!\" to start the battle. She even fought hand-to-hand with the marauding pirates, though was captured while trying to save Will.\n\nElizabeth and the rest of the crew were taken aboard the Black Pearl, and was later forced to walk the plank along with Jack Sparrow, while the Pearl returned to Isla de Muerta with Will. Elizabeth wound up marooned with Captain Jack on a desert island, where she was horrified to discover that this bold pirate had no idea how to escape. She taught the pirate a sea shanty and got him drunk enough to remove him as an obstacle in her attempt to escape.\n\nWhen Jack came around the next morning, he found Elizabeth burning his stock of rum to create a huge bonfire, a smoke signal that ultimately attracted the attention of the HMS Dauntless, out searching for Elizabeth, although Jack made a big fuss about it. Aboard, she accepted Commodore Norrington's proposal, though only as a persuasive method to ensure he helped rescue her true love, Will. Norrington realized this, but was pleased nonetheless. The Royal Navy set up an ambush for the pirates, though Elizabeth was locked in Norrington's cabin by Gillette for her safety. However, Elizabeth escaped and tried to persuade Jack's crew to help in the fight after freeing them, though they simply commandeered the Black Pearl and left Elizabeth to row to Isla de Muerta alone. She arrived in the treasure cave in time to aid Will in fighting Jacoby and other cursed pirates. They were an effective fighting team, though Elizabeth was almost killed when Barbossa attempted to shoot her during a tense stand-off. However, Jack and Will worked together to remove the curse at the opportune moment, killing Barbossa and saving not only Elizabeth but the crew of the Dauntless as well. Elizabeth approached Will in the aftermath, apparently to express her feelings towards him, though Will believed that they would not have a relationship as Elizabeth had agreed to marry Norrington. They left the island on uncertain terms.\n\nFollowing the return to Port Royal, Elizabeth witnessed the build up to Jack's execution at Fort Charles. While she was against his execution, her father reassured her otherwise by saying that they are all bounded by the law. It was here that Will had came up to her and professed his love for her after eight years. Elizabeth was shocked by this revelation, but when she realized that Will had a rescue attempt in progress, she knew she had to do something.\n\nAt the right moment, by pretending to faint, Elizabeth distracted Norrington and her father long enough to allow Will to save Jack. During the rescue, Will and Jack were surrounded by Norrington's men. Above all, Elizabeth followed her heart and so she stood beside Will's side, in opposition to Norrington and her father, in order to spare both Will and Jack's lives. After Jack's escape to the Black Pearl, Elizabeth and Will shared their first kiss on the battlements of Fort Charles, Elizabeth accepting Will not as a blacksmith, but a pirate. Even her father realized that he could not persuade Elizabeth to change her mind.\n\nElizabeth and Will's relationship remained strong over the next year, and Elizabeth became highly proficient at using a sword thanks to Will's training. They were set to be married at Port Royal, though the arrival of Lord Cutler Beckett interrupted proceedings. Beckett had both Elizabeth and Will arrested for their role in the escape of Jack Sparrow, though Will was offered a chance to go free by making a deal with Beckett. Elizabeth, though was forced to languish in the Port Royal prison, set to wait for Will's return, frustrated over her ruined wedding.\n\nHer father was not prepared to see Elizabeth hanged for helping Sparrow, and used his connections to free Elizabeth and book passage back to England. However, their hasty flight was intercepted by Mercer, though Elizabeth managed to evade his clutches. She confronted Lord Beckett in his office, warning him about the treasure of Isla de Muerta, but Beckett assured her otherwise, by saying that there is more than one chest of value. Then she forcing him to give her the Letters of marque that would ensure Will's freedom. With them in her possession, she fled to the harbor and stowed away aboard the Edinburgh Trader, discarding her wedding dress in favor of the guise of a cabin boy in order to go incognito.\n\nElizabeth used the crew's superstitions against them to convince them to make port at Tortuga, where she jumped ship in an attempt to find Will, starting at his last known location. In the Twelve Daggers tavern, Elizabeth encountered James Norrington, who had resigned his commission some months before, and was now embroiled in a bar fight. Elizabeth knocked him unconscious, but later tended to him, musing on his ill fortune.\n\nShe accosted Jack Sparrow as he prepared to board the Black Pearl, stating that she was searching for Will. Jack, although reluctant to let her on board at first, used this to his advantage, first explaining that Will had been press-ganged into service aboard the Flying Dutchman, then convincing her that locating the Dead Man's Chest would result in Will's rescue. Elizabeth was too preoccupied with finding her fiancé to question Jack's motives, and used his mysterious compass to locate Isla Cruces.\n\nThe crew set sail in the direction determined by Elizabeth, who revealed Beckett's deals with Will and herself. Jack took the Letters of marque from her, asking that she \"persuade\" him to give them back. Elizabeth did not rise to the bait, though became confused over her feelings when the compass, which pointed to that which its user wanted most, appeared to indicate Jack. Later on in the voyage, she professed her feeling that Jack was, deep down, a good person, and would soon have a chance to prove it. Jack denied this at first, but using curiosity, Elizabeth stated her certainty of Jack's goodness. The two almost shared a kiss, though Jack broke away when the Black Spot reappeared on his hand. Elizabeth took this to confirm her thoughts on Jack's good nature.\n\nThe crew arrived at Isla Cruces, where Norrington uncovered the Dead Man's Chest. Before Jack could open it however, Will arrived, and Elizabeth flung herself into his arms, kissing him vigorously. However, the reunion then turned into a confrontation when Will, Jack and James engaged in a swordfight over the chest. Elizabeth was forced to stand by helplessly watching as they fought for their goals (and maybe also her love), until Pintel and Ragetti made off with the chest. She pursued them, but was forced to do battle with Davy Jones' cursed crewmen in the jungles of the island, putting the pair's swords and Will's training to good use.\n\nElizabeth and the others made it back to their longboat, though Norrington departed to provide a distraction for Jones' crew. The Pearl set sail, but was confronted by the Flying Dutchman. Once again, Elizabeth aided the crew in outrunning their enemy, and together with Will formulated a plan to attack the Kraken when it was summoned to destroy the ship. During the fight, Elizabeth was stunned to see Jack rowing away, alone, to an island on the horizon. Calling him a coward, Elizabeth turned back to the fight, intent on helping Will.\n\nJack ultimately returned to save his mates, and drove the Kraken off long enough to abandon ship, proving Elizabeth right about Jack. Elizabeth, however, realized that the leviathan was not after the ship or the crew, but Jack himself. She used the pretense of admiring Jack for returning to lure him into a kiss, distracting him long enough to chain him to the mast. She reasoned that it was the only way the crew would be safe, but Jack responded by calling her a pirate, confirming his idea of her being a pirate.\n\nShaken, Elizabeth fled the ship, leaving Jack to his grisly fate in the Kraken's maw. She boarded the longboat with the crew, not knowing that Will had witnessed the kiss, and had assumed that Elizabeth had fallen in love with Jack. Their issues still remained unresolved when the crew arrived at Tia Dalma's shack on the Pantano River. There, Tia Dalma proposed a mission to World's End to rescue Jack and the Black Pearl from Davy Jones' Locker. Elizabeth accepted, mostly out of guilt over her actions, and was shocked to find Hector Barbossa alive and well, and ready to captain the crew on its voyage.\n\nElizabeth journeyed with Barbossa to Singapore, intending to procure Sao Feng's navigational charts. Elizabeth sailed through the backwaters of the city in a peapod canoe, singing a refrain from Hoist the Colours. She was confronted by Tai Huang, and met up with Barbossa before arriving at Sao Feng's bath house. Elizabeth had heard stories of Sao Feng's terrifying nature, and had come prepared with a veritable arsenal of weapons about her person, namely several pistols and one grenade. She was forced to remove these, along with her outer clothing, before entering the bath house.\n\nFeeling exposed, Elizabeth nevertheless remained strong-willed in confronting Sao Feng, but was unprepared for the revelation that Will had been captured attempting to steal Feng's charts, and was being held in the bath house. Elizabeth tried a bluff when Sao Feng asked if they knew the thief, but could not help a cry of shock when Feng made to stab Will. Following this, the negotiations turned sour, with Elizabeth calling Sao Feng a coward for hiding in Singapore, but an interruption by Mercer and the East India Trading Company created an uneasy truce between Barbossa and Feng.\n\nElizabeth fought in the battle that followed, progressing out into the Singapore harbor, where she was ultimately reunited with Will. However, she still had not yet explained the meaning behind her kiss with Jack aboard the Pearl, so their relationship remained distant. The crew boarded the Hai Peng, lent to them by Sao Feng, and set sail for World's End.\n\nBarbossa, using the bartered charts, led the group through a frozen ocean and over the World's Edge. Elizabeth was worried they would all die, but Barbossa pushed her concern aside as they plummeted over the edge. They landed in Davy Jones' Locker where they found Jack and the Black Pearl. At first, Jack didn't believe them to be more than a hallucination until he saw Elizabeth. But even afterwards, Jack refused to sail with them, stating that four among them had tried to kill him, and that Elizabeth was the one who had actually succeeded. Nevertheless, Jack eventually allowed them to sail with him, due to his compass not working in the Locker.\n\nElizabeth and Will's relationship became stronger after they learned the truth, with Elizabeth explaining her actions. Later that night, Elizabeth saw her father, Weatherby Swann, among the dead passing through the ocean of the locker; initially believing that this meant that they had returned to Earth, but was horrified to learn otherwise from Jack. After attempting to bring her father aboard, Elizabeth had to be held back by Will to prevent her from leaving the ship. Weatherby Swann refused to go back to Earth with them, and promised to give her regards to her mother, after relating some of the nature of the Dead Man's Chest, intriguing Jack and Will.\n\nAfter that night, Elizabeth was noticeably more sullen, sadly brooding on losing yet another thing in life. Yet she was still able to help the crew tip the ship to escape the Locker. A tense standoff occurred after they returned, which had Elizabeth with pistols at Barbossa and Jack, all uneasy at first. However, when Jack proclaimed he would leave the pirates to their fate against Beckett, Elizabeth turned on Jack, reminding him he was a pirate, and he owed it to his cause to help. This standoff was defused by wet powder, though during a fresh water expedition on Kraken island, Elizabeth chose to remain on board.\n\nShortly after dispatching the crew, the Black Pearl was captured by Sao Feng and given to Lord Beckett and the crew of the HMS Endeavour. Elizabeth questioned Will on his actions, yet he responded like she did previously, \"It was my burden to bear.\" After Sao Feng learned that Beckett would not be giving him the ship, Barbossa convinced Sao Feng that Elizabeth was Calypso in human form and that he could have her if he helped them escape. Sao Feng took Elizabeth aboard the Empress and fired at the Endeavour, allowing Barbossa's crew to escape. Due to being held by Sao Feng, Elizabeth would not partake in the skirmish that took place.\n\nDuring the voyage to Shipwreck Cove, Elizabeth was treated like a slave by Sao Feng, still believing her to be Calypso. Not much later though, the Flying Dutchman attacked the ship, on the orders of Beckett, who wanted Sao Feng to pay for helping Jack Sparrow escape. He was hit by a cannon ball, and was impaled by a piece of wood. In his last moments, Sao Feng, still believing Elizabeth to be Calypso, made her captain of the Empress and gave her his piece of eight, thus making her a Pirate Lord. When Tai Huang came down to see what had happened, Elizabeth told him that she had been made captain. Tai Huang did not believe her, but when Davy Jones asked for the captain he pointed to her, perhaps so as not to be punished by Jones if he was the new captain. Elizabeth and the crew of the Empress were then taken prisoner aboard the Flying Dutchman.  While on the Flying Dutchman, Elizabeth met Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's father. He was becoming more a part of the ship since he was locked in the brig and was experiencing some mental deterioration. Yet he still managed to carry on one good conversation, stating that if Will slew Jones, he would have to take his place. Elizabeth was greatly saddened by this revelation, seeing Will's dilemma more clearly now. She also met James Norrington again, who had become an admiral under the East India Trading Company. She accused him of murdering her father. Knowing Elizabeth would never accept him, Norrington freed her crew from the brig. Elizabeth was reluctant to accept his help at first, but was soon convinced otherwise in order to save her pirate crew and those at Shipwreck Cove. She tried to make Norrington to come with her, but the arrival of Bootstrap Bill forced him to shoot the escape rope. Bootstrap took advantage of the moment and stabbed Norrington. Though she was devastated about the death of one of her oldest companions, she escaped with her crew on the Empress.\n\nElizabeth arrived at the meeting of the Brethren Court late, but still timely, now in a more suitable Chinese garb. There she revealed, much to the surprise of everyone present, that Sao Feng had made her a pirate lord. She stated that they would need to battle the East India Trading Company, as her time aboard the Dutchman had revealed that Beckett knew of their location. A heated debate ensued, and with the help of Jack, the other lords were almost convinced of the need to fight. Yet Barbossa then pointed out that to attack them now would be an act of war, which only a Pirate King would be able to declare. At that point, Jack called for an election of a Pirate King and surprised everyone present by voting for Elizabeth.\n\nWith the power of the Pirate King, Elizabeth was able to declare war on Beckett, Jones, and the East India Trading Company. After a parley on the sandbar, she witnessed the release of Calypso, at the hands of Barbossa. Seeing that the wind was on their side, she then sailed on board the Black Pearl and participated in battle against the Flying Dutchman in a massive maelstrom created by Calypso. While fighting on the Black Pearl, both Will and Elizabeth realized that they may not make it out of the battle. And so, Elizabeth was married to Will Turner, with Barbossa presiding over the impromptu ceremony. To conclude the wedding, Will and Elizabeth kissed passionately in the ongoing battle.\n\nThe pirates won the battle, though the price was heavy for Elizabeth. Will Turner had to become captain of the Flying Dutchman in order to survive a fatal wound delivered by Davy Jones, meaning she would only see him once every ten years. Before he left, on the day of their honeymoon Will gave Elizabeth the Dead Man's Chest, saying that his heart had always belonged to her, and asking her to \"keep it safe\". Then they kissed passionately, after which Will told her to \"keep a weather eye on the horizon.\" Will departed on his vessel, disappearing in the green flash at sunset.\n\nShortly afterwards, Elizabeth returned to Port Royal, retiring from active piracy, though she retained her Pirate King status. About nine months later, she gave birth to a son. Young Henry Turner accompanied his mother to wait for his father's return ten years after his departure. The Flying Dutchman appeared with a green flash, signifying Will's return from the Land of the Dead. Some say that Will was freed from the service on the Dutchman because Elizabeth remained faithful to him, while others say that he must sail the Seven Seas for all eternity.\n\nDespite some people saying that Will could be released if Elizabeth remained faithful, almost two decades after his initial inheriting of the captaincy of the Flying Dutchman, Will was still imprisoned and bound by its rules. Fortunately for husband and wife, with the destruction of the Trident of Poseidon, Will was released from his curse and able to reunite with his family.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Elizabeth_Swann"}}

Knowing Jack was a card lover, Jolly invited him to a friendly game of poker. Jolly had to cheat to win so he conspired with Witch Doctor Amo Dorsi to deal the cards. Despite having won hand after hand, Jolly Roger lost to Jack. After the ill-fated poker game, Jolly flew into a rage and shot Amo Dorsi. With his dying breath, the Witch Doctor cursed Jolly Roger to walk the earth as the undead, transforming him into a skeletal beast. Jolly Roger lost his humanity but inherited the all-powerful Voodoo forces that gave him the ability to devour souls and raise them from the dead with his supernatural breath. Using his dark powers, Jolly Roger now led an army of undead skeletons that blindly follow him wherever he commands. Jolly Roger then planned to take over the Caribbean and proclaim himself a Pirate Lord, and would do anything to accomplish his goal.","Since his cursing, Jolly Roger appeared to be an undead skeleton, with a skull for a face, fixed in a permenant grin. He had empty sockets for eyes, and had at least one gold tooth, on his left incisor. He had long, black hair made into long dreadlocks which were known to be filled with poisonous snakes, and was often seen with a large, feathered bicorne, out of which protruded two playing cards, which were said to have been the cards he lost the fateful poker game with.

He also lost his right hand. However, these losses didn't prevent him from becoming a pirate captain, commanding the mighty frigate, the Harkaway.\n\nSome time after the start of Roger's captaincy, Jolly Roger and Jack Sparrow were both after a spot on the Brethren Court. After Sparrow obtained a Piece of Eight from the previous Lord of the Caribbean, he became a Pirate Lord himself. Roger became furiously jealous when Sparrow became a Pirate Lord, because he believed himself more deserving of the Piece of Eight.\n\nSoon, Jolly Roger conspired with Amo Dorsi, a voodoo witch doctor, to lure Sparrow into a Poker match, giving Roger the opportunity to steal Jack's Piece of Eight and become a Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea himself. However, the game turned in Sparrow's favor, and Roger, believing Dorsi betrayed him, shot his co-conspirator.\n\nIn his final living moments, Amo Dorsi placed upon Jolly Roger a powerful curse, possibly learned from Tia Dalma, rendering him half-man, half-beast. After Dorsi's body dissipated into dust, Jolly Roger inherited all powerful voodoo forces of his victim. Jolly Roger was now forced to live as one of the undead, feeding on the souls of the living beings for all eternity. He became a scourge of the Caribbean, attacking countless ships and ports. The British Royal Navy wasn't able to capture him, and Governor Swann was forced to put a reward of 1,000 doubloons on his head, and heads of all his undead officers and crewmembers. But that didn't help much.\n\nJolly Roger was known to accost pirates he encountered, threatening their lives unless they spread word of his power, and delivered a message to Jack Sparrow himself: that Jolly Roger was out for revenge. A number of pirates ultimately banded together to face Roger and his undead followers, with the help of Tia Dalma and her voodoo practices.\n\nNow, Roger's greatest desire was not just to become a Pirate Lord, but to rule the Caribbean and kill Jack Sparrow. He started a search that lasted for years, but without success. Then, he began to use his dark powers to raise sunken pirate and privateer ships (mostly frigates and sloops) from the sea floor to create a huge undead fleet, which he was intending to use to spread his power over all Caribbean.\n\nAlso, he has created a army of undead skeletons, raised from their watery graves with only one purpose, to serve Jolly Roger and deliver Jack Sparrow's head to him on a plate.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Isla de Muerta and Sparrow's second escape from Port Royal, Jolly Roger discovered a force that threatened to destroy his plans: the East India Trading Company, under the strong leadership of Lord Cutler Beckett, which began to expand in the Caribbean.\n\nNow, Roger realized the threat that loomed on all pirates, including him. As a preventative measure, he launched several attacks on EITC outposts in the Caribbean. Not wanting to leave Jack Sparrow to flee, Roger had hired captain Bo Beck to capture Sparrow, and to deliver him to Roger himself. When Beck had managed to catch up with Sparrow, the latter made a deal with Beck, giving him double the amount of gold that Roger gave Bo Beck. Sparrow achieved escape once again; Beck, however, was captured shortly after by Roger off the island of Rambleshack. Enraged by Sparrow's trickery, Roger killed Beck and turned him into one of his undead minions. Beck's only passenger, an unnamed pirate, was forced to walk the plank and Beck's sloop was sent by the Harkaway to the depths.\n\nAt some point during the War of Garcia and Pierre, Jolly Roger attempted to cast a spell over the Caribbean that use the power of the moon to convert any pirate caught in its rays to instantly become one of the undead. That spell, called Curse of the Muertos Moon, was unleashed on the islands, and any pirate touched by moonlight was cursed. It is not truly known how the curse was lifted, but the rumors had it that Jack Sparrow had something to do with foiling Jolly Roger's plot. Whether the curse is truly gone remains unknown.\n\nLater, Roger hired a group of pirates to trick other buccaneers into working for Roger. They destroyed the magical protection of the main Caribbean islands, and he began the invasions on Port Royal, Tortuga and Padres Del Fuego. Also, he went to search for the mythical El Patron's lost weapons, which were left in the Caribbean centuries earlier by Spanish Conquistadores. This iniciative clashed once again with Lord Beckett's plans, and both powers began to fight each other in their search, closely followed by the pirates.\n\nThe search ended in the Battle of Raven's Cove, with both sides looting their share of the weapons and slaughtering the inhabitants of Raven's Cove. However, Roger's war was far from over.\n\nA few months after the battle of Raven's Cove, Jolly Roger set a rum blockade on Tortuga, hoping to lure Jack Sparrow out by diminishing his rum supply.\n\nAs a response, Sparrow sent an unnamed pirate (probably the same he'd freed from Rambleshack some time prior) to the newly-rediscovered island of Raven's Cove to retrieve the famed blade of El Patron's, to vanquish Jolly once and for all.\n\nThe blade was eventually retrieved and ended up in Sparrow's power. Later, Jolly found a Voodoo Doll of LaSchafe, the undead Jumbee First Mate in command of the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the infamous pirate Blackbeard. Using the doll, Jolly took control of the Revenge, and sent her to attack pirate ships in the Caribbean.\n\nSome time after taking control of the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jolly Roger turned to other ways of exacting revenge on piracy. Returning to his pursuit of the weapons left behind by the Conquistadors, this search led him to Padres del Fuego, where a famed weapon was said to have been forgotten. Roger made it his goal to acquire this weapon, and to this purpose he launched the major third consecutive invasion of the volcanic island.\n\nThough resistance is fierce and well-spirited, the skeletons inch their path every day towards victory.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jolly_Roger_(pirate)"}}

At some point in his life, he was employed by the Spanish Royal Court. Over the years, he rose through the ranks, eventually becoming King Ferdinand's right-hand man and a personal advisor.\n\nIn 1750, off the coast of Spain, some Spanish fishermen discovered the body of an ancient sailor who sailed with Juan Ponce de León, and with it, the ship's log of the Santiago, Ponce de León's ship. As they showed the body and informed King Ferdinand of their discovery, Ferdinand quickly examined the logbook, which the sailor held. The Spaniard stood right behind Ferdinand as he discovered that the Fountain of Youth was real. In the eyes of the Spanish, the Fountain was the abomination of God's laws. Realizing how great damage such discovery could cause, Ferdinand immediately sent the Spaniard on a dangerous quest for the Fountain of Youth.\n\nThe next morning, the Spaniard sailed from Cádiz with three galleons. While crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the Spaniard's fleet encountered the HMS Providence, a British Royal Navy vessel, whose commander, Captain Hector Barbossa, was also sent to find the Fountain.\n\nThough the Spanish heavily outnumbered and outgunned the British, the Spaniard decided they posed not so big a threat to his mission, and his fleet passed them by without opening fire. But the British crew prepared for the battle, a battle which never began and cost them precious time.\n\nFollowing the directions from Ponce de León's logbook, the Spanish found the island that the Fountain of Youth was located. The Spaniard's men quickly discovered the wreck of Ponce de León's ship, the Santiago, stranded on the edge of the cliff. The Chalices of Cartagena, a key element for the Profane Ritual, were hidden on the ship. The Spanish was able to find the Chalices and quickly retrieved them, leaving the two stones in their chest instead.\n\nWith the Chalices in possession, the Spanish made camp at the abandoned Fort San Miguel to examine the Chalices. However, the Chalices were soon stolen from them by Hector Barbossa who allied with Jack Sparrow. Though the Spaniard's men quickly caught the thieves, they managed to escape and temporarily dispatched his men the same night. With the Chalices stolen once again, the Spanish had to find the Fountain of Youth.\n\nAt the Fountain of Youth, a group of pirates led by Blackbeard, battled against the British crew led by Hector Barbossa. From out of the fog, the Spaniard appeared, backed by soldiers carrying tall banners of the Spanish Monarchy. Heavily outnumbering both groups, the Spanish soldiers surrounded them, and the fighting stopped. The British officer Theodore Groves then attempted to proclaim the Fountain in the name of King George II. But the Spaniard simply took a pistol from one of his men and immediately shot Groves. After ordering one of his men to make a note about Groves' bravery, the Spaniard forcefully took the Chalices from Angelica.\n\nAfter proclaiming that only God could give eternal life instead of the Fountain, the Spaniard dropped the Chalices and stomped on them. He then tossed them into a deep pool and ordered his men to destroy the Fountain. His men started to destroy the temple around the Fountain, though two of Blackbeard's zombies, the Quartermaster and Gunner, tried to stop them, killing or wounding several of them in the process.\n\nThe Spaniard drew his sword and confronted Blackbeard, calling him a fool for seeking what only faith can provide. Blackbeard debunked that statement, saying that in faith there is enough to see but enough to blind. But Barbossa used the moment of Blackbeard's distraction to fatally wound him. The Spaniard turned away from the wounded Blackbeard and watched as the Fountain was destroyed and in ruins. After the Spaniard surveyed his work, by doing the cross, the Spanish departed back to their ships.His further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Spaniard"}}

Five days afterwards, as the Queen Anne's Revenge sailed through the ocean, the recently-recruited human crewmen would work with the zombies, who used ruthless discipline to force the deckhands into following orders while working aboard the Revenge. Yeoman would fight, alongside Angelica and the other zombies, against Jack Sparrow's mutiny. However, Jack's mutiny failed after Blackbeard himself appeared and used his sword to tangle the mutineers with the rigging of the Queen Anne's Revenge.\n\nAfter the Queen Anne's Revenge arrived to Whitecap Bay, Yeoman participated in Blackbeard's mermaid hunt. Shortly after the battle, Blackbeard's crew managed to capture a live mermaid, who Philip Swift named \"Syrena\". The zombies would carry their prize in a glass coffin, half-filled with water, as Blackbeard's crew trekked on an island. While carrying the coffin, Yeoman would trip and break the coffin, causing Syrena to transform into a human form. Later, arriving to the Jungle Pools where mermaids were previously harvested of their mermaid tears, Blackbeard tried to force Syrena to cry. After Philip was seemingly killed by Quartermaster, Yeoman and Master-at-Arms dragged and dumped Philip's body nearby. In reality, this was a ploy so that Blackbeard could get Syrena's tear.\n\nThe next day, Yeoman would have arrived to the Fountain of Youth, where Blackbeard's crew engaged in battle with Hector Barbossa's British crew. Yeoman fought against Gillette, who was killed shortly after by Blackbeard. In the end, Blackbeard was fatally wounded by Barbossa and the Fountain of Youth would be destroyed by the Spanish.

With her great flirtatious charm and prowess in manipulation, she was able to help her husband climb the ranks of the East India Trading Company until he eventually became chief of its branch in Hong Kong.\n\nOne breezy morning in her Hong Kong estate, Barbara walked into her husband's office and spotted him trying to hide a letter from her, but quickly snatched it up before he could stop her. After reading it for herself, Barbara came to the same conclusion as her husband that the warning was nothing more than \"ghost stories\". As Benedict began to dismiss the matter entirely, Barbara suggested that they can use the situation to their advantage, stipulating that they could utilize the information to expand Benedict's position to encompass the entire Pacific Ocean, or else make a deal with the Shadow Lord himself to rid the sea of pirates forever. As they discuss their mutual hatred of Mistress Ching, Benedict assured Barbara that before long, Ching and every other pirate would be twitching at the end of the rope somewhere in the Seven Seas.\n\nSome time later, Benedict and Barbara were contacted by Liang Dao, who had just been overthrown as Pirate Lord by his brother, Sao Feng. They set up a secret meeting so as to establish a deal in which Dao would give them the location of Sao Feng and Mistress Ching's meeting and Benedict would help Dao reclaim his throne. As they attempted to stealthily make their way through the streets of Hong Kong to Dao, Barbara expressed concern that they might encounter a pirate along the way. Benedict began bragging to her that he had trained all of his agents to detect any pirate they may encounter on the streets, and ordered them to run through all pirates they may find on their patrol. Immediately after, he and Barbara came face to face with a troop of seven individuals dressed like East India Trading Company agents, whom unbeknownst to them were really Jack Sparrow, Billy Turner, Jean Magliore, Diego de Leon, Carolina, Lian, and Park. Benedict was fooled by Jack into thinking that the reason his face was covered up was because he had leprosy, and allowed him and the rest of his \"troop\" go on their way. When Barbara noticed that some of the agents seemed oddly feminine and asked Benedict whether he'd begun allowing women to join the EITC, Benedict brushed off Barbara's concerns and urged her to hurry along so as to not to keep their \"mystery informant\" waiting.\n\nAfter her husband's attack on Mistress Ching's opium den failed, Barbara pretended to befriend Marcella Magliore, whom Jack had forced to stay behind with Alex and Catastrophe Shane. Tricking Marcella into thinking that she was desperate and had nowhere else to go, Barbara convinced the young pirate to help her stowaway aboard the Black Pearl during its voyage to India.\n\nDuring the voyage to India, Barbara contacted Benedict via her enchanted hand mirror. During their conversation her husband realized she wasn't home in their estate, and after Barbara started talking about his journey to India she got Benedict to guess that she had stowed away aboard the Black Pearl.\n\nSometime after the Black Pearl had finally reached its destination, Barbara managed to sneak off the ship and contact her husband once again, this time to inform him about all the obstacles blocking the entrance to Sri Sumbhajee's palace. Making her way through the night with only a lantern as her guide, Barbara sought shelter in a stone temple to get away from all the \"horrid mosquitoes\", where unbeknownst to her, Carolina and Diego were hiding and heard every word she said. Barbara was eventually found in Sri Sumbhajee's temple by Marcella, who informed her that the East India Trading Company had arrived at the palace and a battle has broken out between them and Sri Sumbhajee's men. Before leaving to join Benedict, Barbara gave her hand mirror to Marcella, telling the girl it was a gift to remember her by.\n\nAs her husband dueled with Carolina on the dock, Barbara guarded his back to prevent Diego de Leon from rushing to her aid. Before Benedict could kill Carolina, however, a terrified Barbara spotted the stampede of wild elephants Jack Sparrow had loosed into the harbor, and screaming for him to get her out of here, began yanking her husband towards one of the rowboats at the end of the dock. Though her husband was loath to leave the battle, Barbara insisted that they have to go, shoving the oars into his hands and making him row them back to the Peacock. As an enraged Huntington began throwing a tantrum as he watched the defeat of his men from his ship, Barbara calmly made her way to the wheel and signaled to the other sailors to resume their positions so the Peacock could retreat from the harbor with its fellow Company vessels.\n\nAfter the dust had settled and the couple were alone in Benedict's quarters, Barbara was furiously ranted at by her husband for ruining his attempt to capture Jack and Sri Sumbhajee. Barbara insisted that all hope was not lost, however, and having Benedict hand over his hand mirror, activated its power, causing Marcella Magliore to appear within the glass. As Marcella began ranting about \"the stupid Spanish princess\" (meaning Carolina), Barbara reminded her husband that they had heard about a missing Spanish princess from a Portuguese trader. When Benedict revealed his own secret to Barbara, that he'd just recently been contacted by the Shadow Lord, Barbara pointed out to her husband that the watermark on the parchment was in the shape of Lord Villanueva's crest, and that there are \"secrets within secrets\" there they could use to their advantage. Turning back to the mirror, Barbara and Benedict overheard Jack asking Barbossa how long before they reached Madagascar, and the jubilant couple prepared to meet them there.\n\nBarbara and her husband continued to spy on the Black Pearl through the hand mirror during the trip to Africa, but both found the task highly exasperating due to Marcella's many irritating habits. Through their eavesdroppings Barbara and Benedict managed to discover that Jack was traveling to Madagascar to find the Pirate Lord of the Atlantic Ocean, and that the Black Pearl was in actuality the fastest ship in the entire ocean. When her husband began complaining that the EITC tried to order him to return to his post in Hong Kong, Barbara assured him he was making the right choice in ignoring their letter, as the focus must remain on capturing Jack Sparrow.\n\nDuring the voyage to Madagascar, Benedict received another letter from the Shadow Lord, from which he and Barbara learned that Sparrow intended to break into King Samuel's fortress. After Benedict ordered first mate Roland McTavish to make sail for the fort, Barbara approached her husband and asked what he planned to tell Samuel when they arrived. Upon learning of Benedict's intent to fool Samuel into thinking he had come to discuss trade routes to the Indian Ocean, a surprised Barbara questioned his decision to not tell Samuel about the impending attack. When Benedict replied that he was not going to miss the opportunity to watch pirates tear each other apart Barbara reminded him that the Shadow Lord had requested that he keep the two Pirate Lords apart. Benedict insisted that Sparrow would be long dead before he reached King Samuel, as he intended to wait for him at the fortress and kill the pirate himself, and an enthusiastic Barbara agreed his plan would be a lot more fun.\n\nWhen Barbara and Benedict finally arrived at the fortress, they were greeted warmly by the Pirate Lord as Benedict had expected, but the couple were forced to endure Samuel's constant tales of his \"manliness and strength\" as well as a menagerie of animals that regularly wandered through the fort. When Samuel began bragging about how all pirates foolish enough to attack his fort wound up dying, Barbara was silently cued by Benedict to begin distracting Samuel with her flirting prowess. At one point, Samuel became so riveted by Barbara's charms that Benedict was able to slink away in search of the landward entrance to Samuel's fort.\n\nAfter her husband was thwarted from executing Sparrow by a loose gorilla, Barbara and Benedict departed from King Samuel's fort on the Peacock. During their escape, Barbara contacted a stunned Marcella via the hand mirror she had left in her possession, and learned that she would be journeying to France aboard the Ranger. Barbara began furiously insisting that Marcella could not leave Sparrow and the Pearl, to which Marcella informed her that they were all going to France together. When Barbara turned to tell her husband to write that down, Marcella realized that Barbara was not alone. When Barbara turned back to Marcella, she jostled the mirror on her end, causing the room behind her to spin and Marcella to catch a glimpse of the man standing beside her. Recognizing him as Benedict Huntington, a shocked Marcella cried out to Barbara that Diego had warned her about him and that he was \"totally evil\". When Benedict leaned over and told Marcella that he did whatever the Company required him to, a heartbroken Marcella realized that Barbara and he had been working together the whole time, and everything Barbara had told her had been a lie. Barbara brushed off Marcella's hurt feelings and proposed that if Marcella kept telling them where Jack was and what he was planning, they could save her from the pirate life she hated so much, and if she helped them catch him, they could guarantee her safety and probably a big reward as well. When Marcella inquired about Jean's safety and Benedict informed her that there would be no leniency for the other pirates, Barbara confirmed to her that every man aboard the crew was wanted, and that the deal would be for her alone. Barbara's efforts to suade Marcella failed however, as the girl ultimately responded to hers and Benedict's offer by snapping the mirror shut and throwing it overboard.\n\nFurious because of the loss of the second mirror, Barbara and Benedict had a verbal fight about each other's successes and failures, when they were suddenly contacted through Barbara's mirror by the Shadow Lord himself.

At some unspecified point, Toms became an officer of the British Royal Navy and later became captain of the Monarch. Toms' main task was to hunt pirates, so he enlisted a crew for his ship, which included First Officer Wade, Officer Cole and the young sailor Henry Turner, and sailed several times in search of pirates to hunt.\n\nIn 1751, Toms captained the Monarch to hunt down the Ruddy Rose, a Dutch barque captained by the fearsome Captain Bonnet, in the Caribbean Sea. However, the young Henry Turner, upon realizing that they were heading to the Devil's Triangle, ran to warn Toms, telling him that they will avoid entering the Triangle since several ships that entered there would not come out. While several of the sailors onboard reminded Toms that these stories were true, Toms denied changing the direction of the ship. Wade ordered his men to arrest Turner but the boy tried to change the course by force. He was quickly caught and Toms ripped the sleeves of his jacket as a sign of treason, ordering the Marines to lock him in a cell.\n\nHowever, once the Monarch entered the Devil's Triangle, Toms' crew discovered the remains of Bonnet's Dutch barque, concluding that Turner was right. But it was too late, because the terrible and ghostly Capitán Armando Salazar and his ghost crew appeared on the scene, annihilating the Crew of the Monarch and setting fire to the ship. Toms managed to get captured by the Crew of the Silent Mary, who kept him alive so that their Capitan may deal with him. As Salazar made his way toward Toms, he asked \"What are you?\" Salazar then grabbed Toms by the throat and responded \"Death\" before snapping the Officer's neck and throwing him into the fires below.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Toms"}}

His men pulled him out, and before the sailor died, he told them that his ship was attacked and destroyed by a pirate ship flying the red flag of no quarter. Some time later, James sailed for Portugal, where he encountered Don Rafael at Oporto. While having dinner in a tavern, James told Rafael of his tale, in which Don Rafael would later repeated it to the pirate captains assembled at Shipwreck Cove. After their discussion, James sailed off on further ventures.\n\nIt is unknown what ever happened to James.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/James_Hook"}}

Drake was the first Englishman who circumnavigated the world, constantly harassing Spanish ships and ports at the same time. His exploits were legendary, making him a hero to the English but a pirate to the Spaniards to whom he was known as El Draque."],"name":"Francis Drake","description":"Francis Drake, eldest of twelve children, was born in Crowndale, near Taverstock, in about 1540. His father, Edmund Drake (1518\u20131585), was a passionate supporter of Martin Luther and during the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1548, he was forced to flee with his family to Chatham in Kent.\n\nDrake was apprenticed to a captain trading between the Thames River and the Channel ports. In 1563 he joined his cousin, John Hawkins, on a voyage to Africa. The two men started capturing people in Sierra Leone and selling them as slaves to Spanish settlers in the Caribbean. As it was illegal for the settlers to buy from foreigners, Hawkins and Drake soon came into conflict with the Spanish authorities.\n\nDrake's first command was in 1567 when he took part in a successful attack on Spanish ships in the port of San Juan de Ulua. He returned to Plymouth with gold and silver worth over £40,000. Drake, a committed Protestant, saw himself as an instrument of God in his crusade against Philip II and the Spanish Empire. This was followed by voyages to the West Indies and in 1572 he seized gold and silver in the Americas and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAt some point during his operations against the Spanish in the Caribbean, Drake discovered Isla Cueva, a rocky island in Caribbean Sea. Drake loved that island so much that he decided to hide his treasure there. Among the treasure were two magical stones, one purple that protects from curses, and the other white that brings fortune and eternal glory. Drake's men transported the treasure to the grotto deep inside the island, and put several traps on the way to it.\n\nHowever, Drake's First Mate, Sam Johnson, greedy and thirsting for power, attempted to betray Drake so he could take his place and keep the treasure for himself. The ensuing battle resulted in the deaths of at least two members of Drake's crew. But Johnson's attempt eventually failed, and he ended up dead and beheaded. His corpse was left to rot in the treasure cavern, but Drake's men took Johnson's head with them. Because of his betrayal, Johnson's bones magically became black just like his soul.\n\nLater, in England, Drake was introduced to Sir Francis Walsingham, and this association led to a plan for Drake to take a fleet into the Pacific Ocean and raid Spanish settlements there. Investors included Walsingham, Elizabeth I, Christopher Hatton, John Wynter and John Hawkins. Drake's ship was the 150 ton Pelican, double-planked, lead-sheathed, and armed with 18 guns. Wynter contributed his own 80 ton Elizabeth, which carried 11 guns. Another 12 guns were distributed among the 50 ton Marigold, the 30 ton Swan, and the 15 ton Benedict.\n\nThe journey began in November 1577. By the end of the following month six Spanish and Portuguese ships were taken, then looted and eventually set free. Drake also abandoned the Benedict and took one of the Spanish vessels, which was renamed Christopher. The following month they captured a Portuguese merchant vessel, Santa Maria. The commander was Nuño de Silva, who knew the coast of South America. Drake took Silva to serve as pilot of his own fleet.\n\nIn June 1578 the fleet arrived at Puerto San Julián, where Drake put Thomas Doughty on trial for mutiny. He was beheaded on 2nd July 1578. Drake feared that others would rebel and so he called the captains and crew together, then announced that all the officers, who held their appointments from the owners of the ships, were relieved of command. He then reappointed them or most of them as officers responsible only to him.\n\nWhen Drake finally led his fleet through the Strait of Magellan and into the Pacific Ocean, Captain John Wynter took advantage of a storm to leave Drake and took his ship back to England. The Marigold, commanded by Doughty's friend John Thomas, also disappeared, and the Mary was abandoned at Puerto San Julián. Drake, who was left with only the Pelican, renamed it the Golden Hind. Drake now sailed up the Pacific coast. On 1st March he captured the richest ship of all, Nuestra Señora de la Concepción, carrying valuable cargo and 362,000 pesos in silver and gold. Sailing along the coast of Mexico, Drake took a few more ships and raided several more ports. However, the Golden Hind was leaking badly and needed to be careened. On 17th June 1579 Drake landed in an unknown bay and claimed the land for England, naming it Nova Albion. Turning west, the Golden Hind crossed the Pacific Ocean and reached the Moluccas.\n\nAt Java Drake and his crew loaded plenty of food before they sailed through the Indian Ocean, and around the Cape of Good Hope. The provisions lasted until 20 July 1580 when they reached Sierra Leone on the African coast. When Drake arrived in Plymouth on 26th September 1580, he became the first Englishman to circumnavigate the world. Drake return to England as a very wealthy man and he was able to purchase the Buckland Abbey estate. In 1581 Queen Elizabeth knighted Drake and later that year he was elected to the House of Commons.\n\nIn 1585, Drake sailed to the West Indies and the coast of Florida where he sacked and plundered Spanish cities. On his return voyage, he picked up the unsuccessful colonists English colonists in Virginia and returned to Portsmouth in 1586. He also led the expedition which wrecked the Spanish fleet at Cádiz in 1587.\n\nIn July 1588 131 ships in the Spanish Armada left for England. The large Spanish galleons were filled with 17,000 well-armed soldiers and 180 Catholic priests. The plan was to sail to Dunkirk in France where the Armada would pick up another 16,000 Spanish soldiers that were under the command of Alessandro Farnese, the Duke of Parma.\n\nOn July 19, 1588, the Spanish Armada was sighted off Plymouth. Sailing that night, the English fleet, led by Lord Howard of Effingham pursued the Spanish up the Channel. During the pursuit, Drake captured the galleon Rosario and led a major attack on the Armada off the Isle of Wight. On August 7, Drake aided in organizing a fireship assault on the Spanish off Calais. The next day, he played a key role in the English victory at the Battle of Gravelines, which forced the Armada to retreat north, ending the threat of invasion.\n\nAfter the Armada rounded Scotland it headed south for home. However, a strong gale drove many of the ships onto the Irish rocks. Thousands of Spaniards drowned and even those who reached land were often killed by English soldiers and settlers. Of the 25,000 men that had set out in the Armada, less than 10,000 arrived home safely.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Armada, Queen Elizabeth sent Drake to Spain as the leader of the \"English Armada.\" Tasked with supporting an uprising in Portugal and establishing a base in the Azores, the endeavor collapsed when the English failed to take Lisbon and many of their men fell ill with disease. After serving as the mayor of Plymouth (1593), Drake again sailed for the Caribbean in 1595. Early in the cruise, he attempted to sack San Juan, but was driven off by the city's defenders. On January 27, 1596, while anchored near Porto Bello, Panama, Drake died of dysentery at the age of 56. His body was placed in a lead coffin and was buried at sea.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Francis_Drake"}}

Several years after the War Against Piracy, Garheng went to the pub called the Captain's Daughter, located in Londontown. It was here that Garheng, along with a number of sailors and pirates, signed on to sail under Jack Sparrow.\n\nClimbing aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Garheng would work with the crewmen for the next five days, where he would work with a shanghaied Jack Sparrow. He later met with Jack and some of the other crewmen, who were not satisfied with sailing under Angelica and her zombie crew, and took part in Jack's mutiny aboard the Revenge. Jack's crew were soon victorious until Blackbeard himself came out of his cabin. Blackbeard, in response to being told that this was a mutiny, hung all of the crewmen, including Garheng, with the rigging of the Queen Anne's Revenge. Garheng and the rest of the crewmen were let down to witness the Cook's punishment.\n\nThe crew continued their voyage by arriving to Whitecap Bay to hunt for a mermaid, which Blackbeard needed. Despite the heavy casualties, they managed to capture a young mermaid. Later, Garheng joined the crew that accompanied Blackbeard in finding the Fountain of Youth. At the Jungle Pools, Garheng was present when Blackbeard and the crew successfully attained a tear from the mermaid, whom Philip Swift named Syrena.\n\nThe Revenge's crew soon arrived to the Fountain of Youth, but they were met by Hector Barbossa and his crew, and a battle ensued between the two crews. Garheng fought bravely against the British soldiers until the Spaniard and his men arrived to destroy the Fountain.\n\nHector Barbossa was able to fatally wound Blackbeard, and then claimed Blackbeard's ship, crew and sword as payment for his missing leg. Garheng and the rest of the surviving members of Blackbeard's crew joined him as they made their way back the Queen Anne's Revenge. He took his place as part of the crew as Barbossa had the Revenge set sail for Tortuga.

He aided Beckett in taking over Port Royal as well as helped in manipulating the Swann family, which eventually, and inadvertently, lead to his employer's control of the heart of Davy Jones. Throughout Beckett's war against piracy, Mercer had led EITC soldiers in an attack against the crew of the Black Pearl in Singapore, and made a deal with the Chinese pirate Sao Feng, which allowed Beckett's flagship, the Endeavour, to temporarily capture the Black Pearl and the infamous Jack Sparrow. Towards the end of the war, Mercer was placed in charge of Jones' supernatural ship, the Flying Dutchman.","Mercer had a tight, slightly wrinkled face, slick dark brown hair, with a small ponytail tied with a bow on the back of his head. He usually wore a hat and a variety of dark coats, always buttoned up. They ranged from dark brown, to a dark green color. He also usually wore black gloves on his hand, adding to his already sinister look.","Mercer was able to speak several languages. He spoke English, Spanish, Portuguese, and African pidgin. It is unknown if that's because he was highly educated or he just learned them on his travels around the world."],"name":"Ian Mercer","description":"Not much is known of Ian Mercer's early life, but it is known that he was born in Scotland. Over the years, he became a professional spy and a killer for hire. His dangerous life led him to Africa. At some point during the 1730s, he ended up in Calabar, the main British port on Slave Coast.\n\nAfter Cutler Beckett became the EITC Director for West Africa, he immediately hired Mercer, to replace his previous operative, Gates, who was killed on a mission in Nippon.\n\nMercer served as Beckett's personal informant and spy. One day, when the EITC merchant captain informed Beckett about the illegal activities of the EITC's portmaster, Benjamin Blount, Beckett sent Mercer with a group of EITC soldiers to arrest the greedy official. But Blount escaped to the interior of the continent, and was never seen again. Soon, through one of his informants, Mercer discovered that the EITC merchant captain Jack Sparrow sailed from Calabar with Blount's runaway slave Chamba aboard his ship, the Wicked Wench. He informed Beckett of his discovery, but that only convinced Beckett how clever and audicous Jack is and how good a agent he could be for him.\n\nFor some time, Mercer searched around Calabar for antique artifacts of the past civilizations, something which Beckett eagerly collected. One day, Mercer encountered a Portuguese who sold stolen goods. Among his merchandise, Mercer saw several pieces of gold jewelry of ancient design. Mercer brought the trader to Beckett, who recognized the bracelets and pectorals as Kerman. Beckett bought all the jewelry from the trader, but the Portuguese had to tell him how did he get it. The Portuguese told him that he bought the jewelry from the slave trader known as Ancona Wren-John. Beckett immediately sent Mercer to find the slave trader.\n\nWhen Mercer found Wren-John, Beckett questioned him about the jewelry. He told them that he found it on some slaves he captured in the interior of Africa. Beckett sent Mercer to find as many slaves from that caravan as possible, and he was able to locate the two of them, an old holy man named Piye and the seamstress named Ayisha. When Mercer began to interrogate Piye, the old man died with no apparent reason. Afraid that Ayisha could suffer a similar fate, Beckett didn't allow Mercer to interrogate her. Instead, they decided to wait for the return of Jack Sparrow, a man who could seduce her and convince her to give them the bearings of the island of Kerma, a mythical place which was, according to legends and lore, inhabited by the descendants of the Kushites who left Egypt and Kush thousands of years earlier.\n\nWhen Sparrow returned to Calabar, Beckett told him of his plan to pretend to help Ayisha escape from slavery, and then let her lead him to Kerma, from where he would return to Calabar with the exact bearings of the island. Sparrow agreed in exchange for thirty percent of Kerman treasure. Though he believed that Sparrow would return, Beckett ordered Mercer to plant a spy aboard the Wicked Wench. Mercer hired the carpenter Samuel Newton and sent him to join Sparrow's crew.\n\nA few days after the Wench departed, Mercer discovered traces of another Kerman who was sold as a slave. Mercer discovered that he was sold to the plantation of Roger Dalton, but he also discovered that the man escaped from the farm the same night when the Wench sailed from Calabar. Mercer informed Beckett of his discovery, but with the Wench gone, they could only wait for Sparrow's return.\n\nSoon, Beckett and Mercer began to organize a military force with which they intended to conquer Kerma. Beckett assembled a fleet of five ships, both the EITC defense ships and merchant vessels, while Mercer recruited two hundred mercenaries. They knew that Kermans armed with weapons of ancient Egypt couldn't defend their island against an army equipped with modern weapons.\n\nA few months later, Sparrow returned without Ayisha and without the bearings of Kerma. He told Beckett that he and his crew were magically put asleep somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, and when they awoke, Ayisha and the other two Kermans were no longer onboard. Not believing Jack's story, Beckett and Mercer interviewed Sparrow's entire crew, but even Newton confirmed Sparrow's story.\n\nBeckett and Mercer knew that Jack was lying, but they couldn't prove it. So Beckett ordered Jack to transport a cargo of slaves to the island of New Avalon in the Bahamas. Though Sparrow agreed, he sailed for Kerma where he set the slaves free, deciding to become a pirate. But Beckett's fleet followed the Wench and captured her. Sparrow and his First Mate Robert Greene were brought in chains back to Calabar, while Beckett's ships uselesly searched for Kerma, which was hidden by a magical illusion.\n\nA few months later, Sparrow and Greene were brought aboard the EITC brig Sentinel which sailed along the coast. A few miles from Calabar, the Wicked Wench was anchored, with no crew, stripped of everything of value. Beckett's men have searched Jack's captain's cabin and found several hidden sacks full of Kerman gold. Beckett wanted to brand Jack as a pirate. Though Mercer took a hot branding iron to leave an eternal mark on Jack, Beckett took it from him, wanting to do that part of the job himself.\n\nAfter that procedure, Mercer ordered the crew to open fire on the Wench, using inflammable \"carcass charges.\" The Wench immediately started to burn, but Sparrow and Greene freed themselves and jumped overboard. Greene swam for the shore, while Sparrow boarded the Wench, desperately wanting to save his ship. The Wench quickly sank, and it looked to Beckett and Mercer that Sparrow sank with his ship.\n\nFor the next thirteen years, Mercer continued to serve Beckett as his right-hand man. He was with him when he rose to the position of the Governor of the East India Trading Company and became a Lord. Eventually, Mercer and Beckett discovered that Sparrow survived the sinking of the Wicked Wench and became a notorious pirate.\n\nIn the late 1740s, Mercer arrived in Port Royal with Lord Beckett, carrying the arrest warrants needed by Beckett to arrest Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner, and James Norrington. These three had helped Jack Sparrow escape from custody.\n\nBeckett really only wanted to use these three to find Jack Sparrow's compass, so he could use it to lead him to the Dead Man's Chest, in which was the heart of Davy Jones. With this, Beckett intended to rule the Seven Seas, and command Jones to lead his armada and bring about the end of piracy. After the arrests, Mercer helped Beckett set up his operations in Port Royal, discussing various matters of importance. Mercer watched as Beckett made a deal with Will Turner. Will would find Jack Sparrow's compass, and in return, Sparrow would receive letters of Marque and become a privateer in the employ of England. Will and Elizabeth would in turn be pardoned, but if Will did not return with the compass, Elizabeth would be hanged.\n\nWhen Beckett learned that Governor Weatherby Swann was sending his daughter, Elizabeth, to London in order to escape his plans, he sent Mercer to recapture his valuable pawn. Mercer murdered Captain Hawkins, the captain of the vessel that was supposed to transport Elizabeth to England. Soldiers then surrounded Governor Swann and his carriage. Mercer became frustrated when Elizabeth was not in the carriage, and even more so when Governor Swann pretended to not know who Mercer was looking for. Mercer had the Governor arrested and thrown in Fort Charles' prison. Elizabeth had broken into Beckett's office and stolen his letters of Marque, so Beckett sent Mercer to head Elizabeth off at her most likely destination: Tortuga.\n\nIn Tortuga, Mercer found Elizabeth in the Twelve Daggers, a local tavern. A bar fight was in progress, and it was soon ended by Elizabeth herself. The instigator of the fight, Beckett's other fugitive, James Norrington, was thrown into a pool of mud, and was escorted by Elizabeth to the Black Pearl. There he found Jack Sparrow. Instead of following them further, or hindering their departure he offered Norrington a deal on behalf of Lord Beckett and then returned to Port Royal with his report. After Mercer gave Beckett his report, Governor Swann was brought into Beckett's office. Mercer told the governor that Elizabeth had left with Sparrow and other fugitives from justice. Beckett told Swann that the Pearl would be pursued by his ships, and that all those onboard would be doomed. So in return for his daughter's safety, Swann gave Beckett his loyalty. Mercer then removed the governor's cuffs, and set out to find the Pearl.\n\nDuring his search, Mercer found Norrington adrift at sea. Mercer returned to Port Royal and brought him before Beckett. Norrington had stolen Jack's letters of Marque and in return for his pardon, he gave Beckett the heart of Davy Jones, which he had acquired from Isla Cruces during a battle with Sparrow and Turner. With the heart now in his employer's hands, Mercer now had all new objectives to complete for Beckett.\n\nOnce Beckett had the heart of Davy Jones, Mercer was sent to Singapore to find the crew of the Black Pearl. Accompanied by a detachment of East India Trading Company troops, Mercer patrolled the streets and waterways of Singapore looking for the Pearls crew, as well as the secret hideout of the infamous Chinese pirate, Sao Feng. Mercer planted a spy, Steng, into Feng's organization. Steng told Mercer where Feng's bath house was, and Mercer staged an ambush. Hector Barbossa and Elizabeth Swann were meeting with Sao Feng, and it was during the middle of this meeting that Mercer broke through the doors with dozens of soldiers and opened fire on the pirates. During the battle, Mercer tried to shoot Elizabeth, but she was pushed out of the way by William Turner. The shot instead lodged itself in the forehead of Park, one of Feng's twin bodyguards and masseuses.\n\nFeng and the crew of the Pearl escaped though a secret exit of the bath house, and the battle raged into the streets of Singapore. While in a small storehouse, Park's twin sister, Lian, attempted to exact her revenge on Mercer. She drove a steel chopstick deep into his shoulder. During the struggle, Mercer threw Lian onto the ground and shot her dead. As he was leaving the scene Mercer stumbled onto a deal being made between Turner and Feng, and learned that the crew of the Pearl was on its way to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. Later, Mercer caught up with Feng and made his own deal. Feng could have the Pearl once it returned from the Locker, all he needed to do was capture Sparrow and deliver him to Beckett. Feng agreed, and Mercer went to meet with Steng. Steng informed Mercer of the meeting of the Brethren Court, comprised of several Pirate Lords, each of whom needed one of nine pieces of eight to attend. Mercer then returned to Beckett's ship, the HMS Endeavour, to deliver his report.\n\nAfter Mercer gave his report to Beckett, the Endeavour went to survey the damage done by Davy Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman. Beckett had been using Jones to destroy pirate vessels in the Caribbean, but was frustrated that Jones never left anyone alive to interrogate. Mercer remarked that Jones was a loose cannon and that he might need further persuasion to follow Beckett's orders closer to the letter. He also told Beckett that Governor Swann kept asking questions about the Dead Man's Chest. Beckett suggested to Mercer that Swann's usefulness may have run its course. Soon after this, Governor Swann was murdered, presumably by Mercer, being Beckett's personal assassin. Following Mercer's advice, Beckett stationed Admiral Norrington aboard the Dutchman, along with many East India Trading Company troops. In time Mercer would be among them.\n\nAt the appropriate time, the men who had joined Barbossa for the rescue of Jack Sparrow in Singapore turned on Barbossa and his remaining crew, showing that their true allegiances lied with Sao Feng. Feng captured the Pearl, but defaulting on his deal with William Turner, pronounced the ship to be his, and the Endeavour soon appeared on the horizon to collect their prizes. Feng handed Jack over to Beckett aboard the Endeavour. While Sparrow was being interrogated by Beckett, Mercer boarded the Black Pearl with a contingent of East India Trading Company troops to seize control of the ship. Sao Feng became angry that Mercer had lied to him, and conspired with Barbossa to attack the Endeavour, allowing the Pearl to escape. While Feng's ship, the Empress, attacked the Endeavour, Mercer and his men battled the crew of the Black Pearl. While he became embroiled in a duel with Barbossa, his men were all killed. Barbossa kicked Mercer between the legs, and just as Barbossa was about to deliver the final blow, Mercer dived off the Pearl and into the water below, and swam back to the Endeavour.\n\nSometime between the Pearl's escape and the Flying Dutchman's attack on the Empress, Mercer joined Norrington onboard the Dutchman, and took the duty of guarding the chest with several soldiers. Norrington had placed the prisoners from the Empress in the Dutchman's brig, and tied the Empress to the Dutchman, so that it could be towed back to Beckett. However, Norrington soon had a change in heart, and released the prisoners. As they escaped back onto the Empress, Norrington was killed by a delusional \"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner. Jones, believing that the Admiral was the only thing tying him to Beckett, ordered his men to murder all the Company troops onboard, but when Jones reached his organ room, mini-cannons were aimed at the chest, and Mercer held the key to the chest, taunting Jones by saying that the Dutchman was under his control.\n\nThe Dutchman eventually caught up with Beckett, and joined the rest of the armada to attack Shipwreck Island, the meeting place of the Brethren Court. Prior to the battle around Calypso's maelstrom, Mercer's soldiers were refreshed with new ones, since most of them had been killed by the crew of the Dutchman. Mercer remained onboard, near the helm with Jones. As a maelstrom began to form in between Beckett's forces and the pirates, Jones decided to steer the Dutchman into it and attack the Pearl.\n\nMercer was extremely hesitant to head into the vortex, but was unable to stop Jones. Mercer eventually accepted the circumstances and commanded the Dutchman during the early part of the battle, giving orders to the crew and his men. A stray cannon ball fired from the Black Pearl soon streamed toward the helm of the Dutchman. Jones grabbed Mercer and shielded him from the blast. Mercer's grateful mood soon passed when he and Jones realized that all the Company soldiers around the helm had been either incapacitated or killed by the blast. Jones took advantage of the moment and suffocated Mercer with his tentacles. Jones then took the key from Mercer's lifeless body and went to claim the chest, but fate would not allow to Jones to ever have it again. Mercer's body was consumed along with the Dutchman by Calypso's maelstrom.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ian_Mercer"}}

He would spend many years as a pirate of the Caribbean, particularly setting up his home in Shipwreck Cove. Like many pirates, Mungard would learn of the Pirate Code and accept it as the law. He would later be a self-appointed guardian of the Code and stooge of Captain Teague.\n\nMungard would still live in Shipwreck Cove in the mid-1740s. One night, he would join a group of pirates as the Auctioneer led an auction on two wenches, Scarlett and Giselle. Once the bidding ended with the Marquis D'avis winning the two wenches, there was an argument on whether the wenches were for sale or not. The Auctioneer then quoted what was in the Pirate Code, after which Mungard reminded the group of pirates that the Code was the law, and woe to those who showed it disrespect.\n\nAfter Giselle gave Mungard a hard slap on the face, having realized everything she did was the Auctioneer's responsibility, it caused a stir among the pirates. Mungard, vowing that the Auctioneer would pay for that, pointed his pistol at the Auctioneer, who then began a toss of the key to Scarlett and Giselle's shackles, the holder of whom Mungard would point his pistol at. The key would go from Nigel, Atencio and the Marquis D'avis, who then tossed the key to the Auctioneer, who was again threatened by Mungard.\n\nA drunk pirate named Gregor accidentally fired his pistol in the air, causing another stir as the bullet ricochets. The crowd gasped as Mungard turned around with his pistols. The Auctioneer, holding the Code on him, stated that this madness was the doing of Jack Sparrow. Hearing the name Sparrow, Mungard turned around, asking where, as his pistol fired. This fire caused the bullet to hit the Code. The Auctioneer, still holding the Code, fell backwards to the ground. Everyone, including Mungard, stared in shock of what just happened.\n\nThe pirates whisper among themselves about Mungard shooting the Code, one of them saying that Captain Teague would have his head. Mungard then ordered the Auctioneer to be taken out of here. A group of men, including the Auctioneer's assistant, helped get the Code off of a dazed Auctioneer. Mungard then ordered the Code to be locked up and strike the wenches. He then warned the crowd of pirates that if any of them speak a word of what occurred, that he would have their tongues. Every pirate stared at each other until Cotton, and his parrot assured Mungard that mum's the word. Though it is certain that Mungard cut off Cotton's tongue, it is, however, unknown if Cotton's tongue was cut before or after Cotton spilled the beans about Mungard's actions.\n\nMungard's further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mungard"}}

When she encountered Jack Sparrow there, he promised her marriage. He even gave her a ring with the red gemstone to show that he really intends to marry her. Delighted with his proposal, she went to her room to get herself dressed in a proper attire.\n\nHowever, as she was getting herself ready for the wedding, Giselle discovered that her colleague Scarlett was doing the same thing. When they discovered that they have identical engagement rings, both women realized that their grooms was the same man: Jack Sparrow.\n\nSuddenly, the curtains were opened to reveal a crowd of men cheering and shouting. A man known as the Auctioneer appeared, ready to sell them to the highest bidder. Though angry at this revelation, Giselle was even more angry when an old pirate gave a bid of only five pieces of silver. The assembled pirates started offering much more money for Scarlett.\n\nHowever, when they started fighting each other, the Auctioneer offered to sell them as a pair. Finally, a wealthy pirate Marquis D'avis offered 700 pieces of silver and two goats, winning the auction. Giselle and Scarlett were overjoyed, but suddenly, the Auctioneer shackled them, claiming that, as he bought them, he can sell them as well. He even stated that the hallowed Pirate Code says he's right, which the pirate Mungard confirmed.\n\nAngry because of this turn of events, Giselle asked the Auctioneer if he also owns anything she possesses or does. When he confirmed that, she said, Then own this!, and gave Mungard a hard slap on the face, causing a stir between the crowd of pirates.\n\nIn the ensuing confusion, Mungard accidentally shot the Pirata Codex book. Scarlett and Giselle managed to escape. Giselle vowed that the next time she sees Jack Sparrow, she'll be \"re-acquainting him\" with the palm of her hand. Scarlett then revealed that she took out four nails that went on Jack's boat in case he had cold feet on their \"wedding\".\n\nShortly after the incident on Shipwreck Island, Giselle moved to another pirate port, Tortuga. One day, upon seeing Jack Sparrow and Scarlett together, Giselle slapped Jack across the face; echoing a slap Jack had moments before received from the similarly-irate Scarlett.\n\nDespite the divide between them, Scarlett and Giselle were often seen in each others' company in Tortuga. When William Turner searched for Jack Sparrow, the two claimed they had not seen Sparrow for a month, and asked if he could give him a message from them (another slap).\n\nJack was ultimately reunited with both Scarlett and Giselle following his rescue from Davy Jones' Locker and the end of the Battle of Calypso's maelstrom, and was again greeted with a slap after admitting he loved neither of them. Giselle and Scarlett departed in the company of Joshamee Gibbs, while Jack set off on his quest for the Fountain of Youth.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Giselle"}}

Constance leapt at Louis before the pirate could punish Jean, and tore her claws across Louis' face, marking him for life. The trio were able to escape after Louis was set upon by the crew, though not before he swore to skin Constance alive upon their next meeting.\n\nThe Magliores and Tumen sailed together for almost a year following their escape from Louis, and were aboard the Seraph when it was caught in a storm conjured by Captain Torrents. The trio were the only survivors, washed up on the shore of Isla Esquelética, where they were forced to eke out an existence, and began constructing a raft to return to their home port.\n\nIt was on Isla Esquelética that the three met Jack Sparrow, Arabella Smith and Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III. Sparrow's crew was initially wary of Constance, and were dubious over Jean's claim that Constance was really his sister. Nevertheless, Jack allowed the Magliores and Tumen to join his crew, and together explored the City of the Dead, and survived a confrontation with Torrents.\n\nShortly before Jack Sparrow's quest for the Shadow Gold, Constance was turned into a human again. When the Black Pearl docked in New Orleans, she joined the ship's crew, but she started to introduce herself as Jean's cousin, Marcella, to hide her previous participation in Jack's adventures. Later, she fell in love with the Diego de Leon, although he was not attracted to her in any sense and was instead infatuated with Carolina, a rogue Spanish princess. Constance would compete fiercely for Diego's affections, even resorting to telling the Spanish, who were tracking Carolina, where she was. After the Day of the Shadow was over, Jack found out that she and Constance were, in fact, the same person.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Constance_Magliore"}}

After helping rescue Jack Sparrow in Davy Jones' Locker, Barbossa had to join up with the Brethren Court to battle against Lord Cutler Beckett, who had control over Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman. More than a decade later, Barbossa had lost his leg, and the Black Pearl, which forced him to serve as a privateer, claiming to owe his allegiance to King George II. Having been given command aboard the HMS Providence, Barbossa participated in the quest for the Fountain of Youth, where he would rendezvous with Jack Sparrow, Blackbeard and destiny.","Barbossa was a tall man speaking with a strong West Country accent and uses the pirate \"arr\". His face was covered with pockmarks or freckles and he had many scars, the most notable one is under his right eye. He wore his auburn, greying hair long and partially loose, partially tied up to a thin plait. He had a straggly beard running down to the base of his neck. Barbossa also had a braid descending from the top of his head to the back of his head.

Barbossa even bejeweled his peg leg with gold and wore a brown leather boot on his left leg with gold straps."],"name":"Hector Barbossa","description":"Like most pirates, Hector Barbossa came from England's West Country, and his mother was Irish. Nothing is known of Barbossa's father, but his last name indicates possible Portuguese or Spanish origin. Although Barbossa's history prior to engaging in piracy remains mainly shrouded in mystery, it was known that he grew up on a farm, possibly somewhere near Bristol, and he ran away to sea at the age of 13 because he came from a background of poverty. He would be on board ships where he'd seen very grand cabins and the captains living in spacious and elegant quarters. Barbossa may have had earnest desires to be a man of the sea, but realized that he could gain a lot more if he broke the rules, lied to people, and killed a few in the process. Barbossa became greedy, with horrible social pretensions. He became a horrible liar, pretending to be a gentleman of the sea, and a dirty, cunning rogue. Barbossa also had a sword on his belt and learned how to skewer people and survive by using preemptive logic to map out his plans and deceive people.\n\nNot much is known about Barbossa's early adventures, except that he became a capable pirate. In his early forties, Barbossa was the captain of a small pirate schooner named Cobra. After he plundered a French barque loaded with ivory, his ship was attacked by another pirate ship, in the waters north of Bermuda. His ship sank, and he almost drowned, but he was saved by two of his crewmembers, Pintel and Ragetti. Two months later, Barbossa and his men were picked up in Tortuga by Don Rafael, Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. Don Rafael took them to Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa told the tale of his disaster to assembled pirates. During that meeting, he met Jack Sparrow for the first time.\n\nA few months later, Jack Sparrow discovered what ship sank the Cobra. It was the Koldunya, a ship of Boris \"Borya\" Palachnik, the Russian Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea and Barbossa's old friend. Jack immediately informed Barbossa of his discovery, and the pirate captain recognized the Koldunya as the rogue ship. Captain Edward Teague, Keeper of the Code, and Don Rafael, joined them on the docks, and they agreed to search Borya's ship.\n\nLater, Teague called for an official court of inquiry, and the Pirate Lords assembled in the Great Chamber. At the court, all the witnesses told their stories, but since there was not enough evidences against Borya, Teague decided to summon Davy Jones, the Lord of the sea. Jones knew everything that happened in his watery kingdoms, and the Brethren Court spoke a magic call that brought Jones onboard the Troubadour, Teague's ship. When asked about Borya's guilt, Jones recognized him as the leader of the rogue pirates, saying that he and his men sent many souls to the sea bottom without mercy.\n\nBorya and his whole crew were imprisoned and sentenced to hang. Borya even gave them the name of one of the rogue captains under his command, Christophe-Julien de Rapièr, captain of La Vipère. The French pirate and his crew were also quickly captured. A few days later, Barbossa visited Borya in a prison, where Borya apologized for the destruction of Barbossa's ship. Borya even gave Barbossa his most precious token, a small block of wood, his Piece of eight, the sign of pirate lordship, thus making Barbossa the next Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea. However, Barbossa didn't know the meaning of the Piece of Eight at that time, and Borya didn't tell him about its importance. Borya also agreed to give the Koldunya to Barbossa as a payment for the loss of the Cobra, so he wouldn't be a captain without the vessel.\n\nA few hours later, Barbossa encountered Jack Sparrow and Don Rafael's granddaughter Esmeralda at the Drunken Lady tavern. He told them about his conversation with Borya, and showed them the block of wood which Borya gave him. Both Jack and Esmeralda recognized Borya's piece of eight, and they told Barbossa to show it to Captain Teague as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, that same night, the rogues escaped on the Koldunya and La Vipère, taking Jack with them. After that, Barbossa intended to join Captain Teague's fleet in rogue-hunting. He gave Borya's piece of wood to one of his subordinates, Ragetti, who missed an eye and ordered him to keep it safe, without learning its meaning.\n\nIn unknown circumstances, Barbossa lost contact with Ragetti and his Piece of Eight. Five years after the escape of the rogues from Shipwreck Cove, while he was in Tortuga, Barbossa joined the crew of the Black Pearl, captained by Jack Sparrow. Barbossa was made Sparrow's first mate, and the crew set out from Tortuga to the Far East, sent by Tia Dalma to collect seven pieces of powerful magical potion called the Shadow Gold, and prevent an evil alchemist, the Shadow Lord from destroying the Pirate Brethren. Sparrow and Barbossa traveled around the world, chased by the East India Trading Company and the Shadow Army, but at the end, they were able to defeat the Shadow Lord with the assistance of all Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court.\n\nTwo years after the adventure with the Shadow Gold, the Black Pearl sailed towards Isla de Muerta to find the lost treasure of Hernán Cortés. Although Barbossa didn't believe Jack Sparrow about the curse that was placed on the treasure, believing it as a \"ridiculous superstition,\" he went on the search anyway. Isla de Muerta was an island in the Caribbean that could not be found except by those who already knew where it was, but Captain Sparrow had a map as to the approximate location of the island. Three days into the voyage, Barbossa was able to coax the bearings from Jack. The then over-trusting Jack gave his bearings willingly to his \"loyal\" first mate, thinking that he could help in finding the island.\n\nThat same night Barbossa rallied the rest of the crew in a mutiny against Jack. They marooned him on an island, jokingly appointing him its \"governor\", and gave him a pistol with one shot\u2014to kill himself when the heat and thirst got too much. With the Pearl now under Barbossa's control, they then sailed towards Isla de Muerta. Prior to this however, Barbossa attained his precious pet monkey, mockingly named \"Jack\", after their old captain. Then, with Jack's bearings, the crew found the island and the treasure inside it's caves. Inside a large stone chest were 882 identical pieces of Aztec coins, once belonging to Hernán Cortés, given to him by the Aztec to stop the ambitious Spaniard from slaughtering their people. Cortés continued his conquest despite the tribute. According to legend, the heathen gods of the Aztec placed a curse on the treasure to avenge the fallen people. Supposedly, anyone who took a single piece from the chest would be cursed for eternity. The crew ignored the legends which Jack Sparrow has mentioned to them earlier, and seized the treasure for themselves. They returned to Tortuga and after a time, they traded the whole gold away on frivolous things.\n\nVery soon they realized that the legends were true, and they lost the ability to taste, digest, or feel in general. Perhaps worst of all, at night, beneath the moon, they were revealed for what they were: undead skeletons; neither living nor dead, and unable to die or succumb to bodily harm. Nevertheless, the crew set about immediately to find the lost treasure.\n\nThere was only one crewman who had been bitter and guilt-ridden ever since the marooning of Jack Sparrow: Bootstrap Bill Turner who sent a piece of the treasure to his child, telling the others that they deserved to be cursed. This angered Barbossa greatly, so he ordered his men to strap \"Bootstrap's bootstraps\" to a cannon. He then ordered them to push the cannon overboard, taking \"Bootstrap\" down to the crushing depths, unable to die, yet unable to move. Barbossa was able to figure out a way to reverse the curse: by returning the coins to the chest and offering a tribute in blood, the curse of the heathen gods would be satisfied, and the crew would be free. With this plan in mind, Barbossa and his crew set out to try and recover the treasure by using an ability to sense when a coin was near.\n\nAt some point during the quest to lift the Aztec curse, Barbossa recalled the story of Icarus before his crew came across a mysterious castaway, a young boy floating unconsious in the middle of the ocean. Somehow still alive and wearing shackles, the boy was brought on board the Black Pearl. After ordering Ragetti to fix the boy a stew, Barbossa felt that something was wrong. When Barbossa asked Pintel about his opinion on the bodies of the ship's crew, Pintel said they were eaten by the sharks, but Barbossa cleverly noted that there was no blood on the surface of the water.\n\nLater, as the boy had dinner in the captain's cabin, Barbossa expressed his curiosity on the situation about the wreck of the Delfin, the shackles on the boy's hands, and the boy himself being alive. Despite Barbossa's disbelief, the young boy insisted himself to be Juan Ponce de León and that he managed to find the Fountain of Youth. Claiming the Fountain, among other things, \"cured all my ills in an instant\", the boy offered to take Barbossa to the Fountain. Believing that the Fountain of Youth might hold the key to lifting the terrible curse that his crew was under, Barbossa ordered his men to chart a course to the Fountain's location.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Bo'sun informed Barbossa that they were arriving at the cove, causing the captain to close a book about Greek mythology. Upon reaching the dubious destination that had a statue of a boy riding a dolphin, Barbossa told \"Mr. de Leon\" a story pertaining to Greek mythology. He collectively accused the young passenger of being Melikertes, who revealed himself now to be Palaimon, a demonic Greek sea god who fed on the human souls. As Palaimon summoned an army of souls to fight against Barbossa's undead pirates, he himself engaged in a fierce duel with Barbossa. Against the odds, Barbossa defeated Palaimon by forcing him to fall into the sea, deducing that he couldn't swim due to having found him clinging to a piece of floating wood and that his altar showing him riding a dolphin. After making sail for safer waters, Pintel asked Barbossa if the Fountain was real, despite what had occurred. Barbossa responded in saying that they're un-living proof that such tales were nothing more than tales of hope and redemption, then finished by saying he didn't believe in fairy tales.\n\nTwo years after falling under the curse, the Pearl attacked a ship with a coin on board. They were not able to find the coin and left the burning wreckage behind them, narrowly avoiding a confrontation with the HMS Dauntless. In the mysterious circumstances, Barbossa learned the meaning of the piece of wood which Borya gave him years ago, and became the new Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea.\n\nOver the course of the next eight years, the crew raided and pillaged settlements throughout the New World, searching for the lost pieces of Aztec gold. At last, they returned all but one of the coins to the chest. One day, Barbossa and his crew sensed the last piece. They followed the \"call\" of the gold, and finally ended at the British colony of Port Royal. They attacked at night, blending in perfectly with the dark and cloudy night. The Pearl was followed by an eerie fog, a side-effect of the cursed crew's long-term occupation of the ship. Due to the cover, the Pearl was able to attack Port Royal unhindered. Barbossa ordered his cannonneers to fire on Fort Charles. While the ship occupied the fort's attention, Barbossa sent a raiding party to collect the coin.\n\nSome time later, the boats returned laden with swag. Two of Barbossa's crewmen, Pintel and Ragetti, came aboard with a young female hostage. When his boatswain, Bo'sun, asked them why they had brought a captive, the young woman tried to explain she had invoked the right of parley so she could negotiate a truce with the Captain, but was slapped in return. Barbossa took offence to this and reprimanded the boatswain and apologized to the woman. She audaciously demanded that Barbossa cease his attack on Port Royal, or else she would throw the Aztec coin overboard. Barbossa tried to hide the crew's need for the medallion she wore around her neck, but the young woman said that she had seen the Pearl on her crossing of the Atlantic from England eight years before. Barbossa asked for the girl's name. She responded by saying her name was Elizabeth \"Turner\", and that she was a maid in the governor's household. Barbossa was thrilled by the fact that they had very likely found \"Bootstrap's\" child, after all these years, and would finally be able to lift the curse. Barbossa agreed to leave Port Royal and ordered his crew to set sail. After giving over the medallion, \"Miss Turner\" demanded she be taken ashore. Barbossa refused, citing that her return to shore was not part of their agreement. With that, the Pearl set off towards Isla de Muerta, to lift the curse.\n\nWhile the Pearl sailed towards Isla de Muerta, Barbossa entertained Elizabeth, and held her as his guest in his cabin. Food that was always kept near, in case the curse was lifted, was now able to be cooked and brought out. Barbossa watched, utterly envious, as Elizabeth ate her food. She, however, was suspicious as to why Barbossa was not eating, but was encouraging her to eat instead. Elizabeth asked if the food was poisoned; Barbossa was amused. He told her that there was no sense in killing her. Elizabeth asked why he was still keeping her. Barbossa saw that Elizabeth did not know about the curse, and so he told her the story of the crew and its curse. He then told her that she was the last blood sacrifice needed to lift the curse. At that, Elizabeth leapt up and attempted to run out of the cabin. Barbossa ran after her, but Elizabeth turned around and stabbed him with a knife from the table; she was shocked to see that Barbossa was unharmed. Elizabeth then ran out into the moonlit sky, and ran face to face with the half-dead skeleton crew. While drinking wine from a bottle Barbossa explained the curse's effect on the crew, and, startled, Elizabeth ran back into the cabin, where she remained for the duration of the voyage. Barbossa locked the doors behind her and laughed.\n\nUpon reaching Isla de Muerta, the crew of the Pearl unloaded all of their booty into the caverns, while Barbossa prepared the ritual. After a short speech, Barbossa cut Elizabeth's palm with the ritual knife, covered the coin with her blood, and dropped it into the chest. Not feeling any different, Barbossa shot Pintel to see if the curse was lifted. Surprisingly, Pintel did not die. Barbossa confronted Elizabeth, asking her if William Turner was her father. Elizabeth admitted that she was not, but refused to tell Barbossa who William's child was. Frustrated, Barbossa slapped Elizabeth, dropping the coin as well. While the crew at first became angry at Pintel and Ragetti for bringing the wrong person, they soon turned their attention to Barbossa, claiming every decision he had made has led them from bad to worse, the curse itself being the most prominent example. But, when Barbossa brandished his sword, challenging the crew to fight him, no one dared fight against such a skilled swordsmen and stopped blaming Barbossa. The confrontation was interrupted by Jack the monkey, who pointed towards the exit of the caverns, screaming. Barbossa turned towards where Elizabeth had fell, and saw that she was no longer there.\n\nHe ordered the crew to find her. Soon the crew called for him, and he went to find, much to his amazement, Jack Sparrow. Barbossa asked him how he got off his island, and Jack said that he had forgotten a very important thing, that he was Captain Jack Sparrow. Barbossa, annoyed with Jack's self-aggrandizing attitude, ordered his crew to kill Sparrow. Sparrow, however, coolly asked if Elizabeth's blood hadn't worked. Barbossa, perceiving Jack's motives, ordered his crew to hold fire. Jack then told him that he knew who's blood they really needed. Since a compromise couldn't be made on the spot, and the medallion, on the HMS Interceptor (Barbossa learned the name courtesy of Jack) was getting farther and farther out of Barbossa's reach.\n\nSo the crew and Jack boarded the Pearl and headed out in hot pursuit of the Interceptor. Barbossa and Sparrow, meanwhile, attempted to cut a deal in Barbossa's cabin. Jack was attempting to make Barbossa give him \"his\" ship, where then he would strand Barbossa on a beach and shout the name of the person who's blood he needed to him, as he sailed away. Barbossa, however, did not feel comfortable with giving away his ship, while he trusted that the name Sparrow gave him was the one he needed. Negotiations were at a standstill when Bo'sun entered the cabin and informed them that the Interceptor was in view.\n\nBarbossa ordered Jack to be put in the brig and headed closely behind the Interceptor. The resourceful crew of the Interceptor, however, attempted to lose the Pearl over an unnamed shoal. The Interceptor, small and light, was easily able to transverse over the shoal. It then began to dump supplies and cargo overboard, to make it go even faster. Barbossa ordered the crew to bring out the oars, as well as the guns, confident that the Pearl would catch up with the Interceptor before she reached the shoals. As the Pearl slowly caught up, the Interceptor attempted one last trick. It lowered its starboard anchor into the shoal, catching one a rock and turning sharply around towards the Pearl. Barbossa quickly ordered the crew to turn the ship around, and ordered a full broadside.\n\nBarbossa gave his crew orders during the ensuing battle, overseeing the boarding of the Interceptor, and giving commands to his cannonneers. During the battle, the main mast of the Interceptor crashed onto the Pearl's deck, and Jack the monkey crept onto the mast and scurried onboard the Interceptor. The monkey soon returned, medallion in hand, with Sparrow (out of his cell) suspiciously in hot pursuit of the monkey. Barbossa's crew then captured the survivors of the crew aboard the Interceptor, and tied them up, while Barbossa, tipped off by his crew that they had set up an explosion, eagerly waited for the Interceptor's destruction, the medallion in his hand.\n\nAfter the Interceptor exploded, Barbossa was confronted by a man claiming to be Will Turner, son of \"Bootstrap Bill\". He intended to shoot himself, and fall into the sea, thus making his blood unattainable for Barbossa's plan to lift the curse. Barbossa asked Turner what his terms were; Turner said he wanted Elizabeth to be set free, a term Turner eagerly made clear previously, and he also wished for the crew of the Interceptor not to be harmed. Barbossa agreed, ordering the crew of the Interceptor to be locked in the brig.\n\nBut, instead of just leaving Elizabeth at a port, he decided to cleverly twist his bargain with Turner and \"release\" Elizabeth by marooning her on an island, the same island that Jack had been marooned on all those years prior. But, she would have company; Sparrow was also to be marooned on the island, in response to his previous escape, and for trying to manipulate Barbossa. With those two dealt with, Barbossa turned the Pearl back toward Isla de Muerta, now finally able to lift the curse. At the request of his crew, Barbossa intended to kill Will and spill all of his blood to lift the curse in order to avoid any mistakes.\n\nBarbossa's crew made for Isla de Muerta, though the Pearl sailed slower than usual due to damage sustained during the fight. By the time Barbossa began the ritual once more, this time with Will as the sacrifice, Jack Sparrow miraculously appeared yet again, leaving Barbossa in utter disbelief. Jack informed Barbossa and his crew that the HMS Dauntless was sailing just off shore, waiting for them. With the ritual successfully stalled, Jack offered Barbossa a deal: Barbossa would seize the Dauntless for himself, leaving Jack as captain of the Pearl, and would have the makings of his very own fleet, and could take the title of commodore. Enticed, Barbossa agreed to Jack's proposal in return for twenty-five percent of Jack's plunder, and Jack's promise that he would purchase Barbossa a big hat. Barbossa sent his men on a walk on the ocean floor, while he, Will and Jack waited in the caves for the battle to end.\n\nBarbossa was starting to trust Jack again and noted that Jack was a hard man to predict. This trust ended when Jack freed Will, who engaged Barbossa's men, while Jack dueled Barbossa. Ultimately, Barbossa, knowing that Jack could not kill him, threw his weapon aside. Sparrow, taking the opportunity, stabbed Barbossa in the chest. Barbossa sighed to himself, ripped out the sword, and in turn stabbed Jack with it in the gut. Jack staggered backwards, feigning mortal injury, but a seemingly accidental step into a shaft of moonlight revealed him to be under the influence of the curse: He had sneaked a piece of gold from the Chest of Cortés while talking to Barbossa.\n\nThe duel continued around the cave, quite pointlessly, until finally, Barbossa pulled a gun on Elizabeth Swann, who had come to help Will and Jack. Before Barbossa could pull the trigger, however, Jack shot him in the heart. Barbossa sneered, claiming that Jack wasted his shot. But upon defeating Barbossa's crewmen, Will had gathered the last two coins, with blood from himself and Jack, and dropped it all into the chest, lifting the curse. Unbuttoning his coat, Barbossa found that the wound from Jack's shot began to spurt blood. Now able to feel again, Barbossa then stated that he felt cold before falling to the cave floor, dead.\n\nFor an unknown amount of time, Hector Barbossa's dead body remained in the treasure caves of Isla de Muerta. Through undetermined circumstances, Barbossa was at some point resurrected from the dead by the voodoo mystic Tia Dalma, the human form of the sea goddess Calypso. During the War of Jolly Roger, Barbossa was reputedly found haunting the island known as Devil's Anvil, providing information that only a dead man could know. Several of Barbossa's possessions were spotted by Jack Sparrow's crew while visiting Tia Dalma's wooden shack seeking information about the Dead Man's Chest. The crew spotted Barbossa's boots after Tia Dalma released Jack the Monkey, who ran straight towards his boots, while Jack Sparrow himself briefly held Barbossa's old black hat.\n\nHowever, Barbossa's resurrection came at a price: Tia Dalma\/Calypso needed Barbossa, as one of the nine Pirate Lords, to assemble the Brethren Court so they could release her from her human bonds. Complications arose when Jack Sparrow and the Black Pearl was taken to Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. It wasn't until the remainder of Jack's crew came for refuge at Tia Dalma's shack did Barbossa reveal himself, much to the crew's surprise, after Tia Dalma proposed the crew set out on a voyage to World's End, waters that Barbossa had prior knowledge of. However, they needed a map that led to the Locker, so Barbossa and the crew set out for Singapore.\n\nBarbossa led Jack's former crew to Singapore, but not before having sent forth Hoist the Colours, a song meant to summon a meeting of the Brethren Court. Before Barbossa and his associates could venture to World's End to save Jack Sparrow, they needed to obtain a ship, crew, and the navigational charts that led to World's End from Sao Feng, the notorious Pirate Lord of Singapore. A meeting with Sao Feng was arranged so that Barbossa could request the ship and the crew, and Will Turner was sent to steal the charts.\n\nBarbossa and Elizabeth Swann went together to meet Sao Feng at his Singapore bath house. Barbossa sent the rest of the crew into the passages below the bath house; they hid there, alert, ready to provide support if things went wrong. Feng ultimately told Barbossa that it was an odd coincidence he would ask for a ship and a crew on the same day his navigational charts were almost stolen. Feng then revealed the captured thief to his guests\u2014 it was Will Turner. He was being kept in a vat of water. Barbossa pretended that Will was not known to him, but when Feng moved to kill Will, Elizabeth shrieked. Certain then that Barbossa and Elizabeth had lied to him, Feng asked why they were going to such lengths to acquire his charts. Barbossa attempted to change the subject by telling that the song was sung and summoning him, as one of the Pirate Lords to the Brethren Court, in order to decide what was to be done against the forces of East India Trading Company\u2013\u2013which was systematically exterminating pirates around the world.\n\nFeng was hesitant to enter into open war with the East India Trading Company and remarked that pirates were betraying each other instead of holding together. After this, Elizabeth declared him a coward. Feng was impressed by Elizabeth's assertiveness but instead of answering her, he pointed out that Barbossa had still not said why he wanted his charts. Barbossa and Elizabeth both refused to answer, but Will revealed that they needed the charts to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. Feng became angry because Sparrow had insulted him once, and declared that the only reason why he would not want Jack Sparrow to remain dead is that he wanted to kill Jack himself. Barbossa then stated that Sparrow was one of the nine Pirate Lords and could not pass on his Piece of Eight before being dragged into the Locker, and therefore they could not open the Brethren Court without him.\n\nThe meeting became much more tense, when Feng suddenly noticed an unfamiliar man with a fake tattoo among his soldiers\u2014undoubtedly another spy. Assuming that the man belonged to Barbossa\u2019s crew, Feng called on his soldiers, who came out of their hideouts. Barbossa tried to calm his opponent, but without success. Barbossa\u2019s men who were hiding under the floor, realized that this attempt has failed and that Barbossa and Elizabeth needed help, so they threw four swords through slots between the planks forming the floor of the bath house and Barbossa and Elizabeth grabbed two of them each. Feng immediately seized the spy and declared that he would kill him if Barbossa did not drop his weapons. Barbossa, however, encouraged Feng to kill the man, claiming that the spy was not his, but at that moment the beginning confrontation between Feng on one side and Barbossa, Will and Elizabeth on the other side was suddenly interrupted by the arrival of a large group East India Trading Company soldiers led by Mercer.\n\nBarbossa and Feng briefly united their forces against a common enemy and fought their way through the harbour. During the battle Will Turner made his own deal with Feng without Barbossa's knowledge; he acquired the charts himself, and provided Barbossa with a crew of Chinese pirates led by Tai Huang and a junk ship, the Hai Peng. They took the ship and left for World's End\n\nAfter escaping safely from Singapore, the crew sailed through uncharted, frozen wastes to reach the Farthest Gate, although Barbossa was unable to decipher the charts' cryptic instructions for returning from Davy Jones' Locker. Undaunted, Barbossa showed no fear neither when he led the Hai Peng into a giant ice cave, where they got lost, what he claimed to be necessary to find a place that can't be found else ways, nor when he sailed the ship over the world's edge, plunging the junk and its crew into the underworld.\n\nThe ship was wrecked, though all of the crew survived and made it to Davy Jones' Locker. Shortly after, they were all reunited with Jack Sparrow, who was still with the Pearl. Barbossa brought up their last fateful meeting in conversation, though Jack brushed this off and, leaving Barbossa out of his new crew, continued to refer to himself as the one and only captain of the Black Pearl. Barbossa contested this, knowing that Jack could not leave the Locker without the charts, which were now in Barbossa's possession. Thus, the two rivals were forced to co-operate as the Pearl set sail on the endless seas of the Locker.\n\nWhen sailing these mysterious waters, Barbossa and Jack were constantly fighting over who had the right to be captain, but finally he and Jack decided that Barbossa was to be captain of the starboard side, and Jack captained the port side. Sparrow ultimately worked out the meaning of the charts, and coerced the crew into tipping the Pearl upside down. Barbossa understood Jack\u2019s plan and ordered the crew to loose the cannons and the freight in order to make capsizing the ship easier and even hacked some ropes securing the barrels himself to accelerate the process. The capsizing happened coinciding with sunset in the Locker that resulted in a green flash and the return of the Pearl to the land of the living.  The moment Barbossa was sure he was back in the real world, he pulled his flintlock on Sparrow, forcing him to agree to meet with the Brethren Court and Shipwreck Cove. Immediately, Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner, Joshamee Gibbs and Jack the monkey, also drew their pistols and pointed them at each other, so that a few seconds later numerous barrels pointed at Barbossa who was treating Sparrow with one pistol and Joshamee Gibbs with another. The tense stand-off was diffused when Jack Sparrow attempted to shoot Barbossa and found out the crew's pistols malfunctioned due to wet powder, so they put them away and set about locating a source of water at a nearby island.\n\nHowever, Barbossa and Sparrow nearly quarreled once again because they mistrusted each other so much, that none of them could afford the risk of leading the landing party and leaving the other one aboard the Pearl, because he had to fear that the one who stays aboard might commandeer the ship in his absence and sail away leaving him behind on the island. Will Turner solved the situation when he proposed that both Jack and Barbossa should go ashore temporarily leaving him as the Pearl's acting captain.\n\nAfter the arrival on the island, Barbossa and Sparrow happened upon the corpse of the Kraken, and Barbossa remarked upon the certainty of death to counter Jack's insistence to the contrary. However, Barbossa, like Sparrow, would contemplate his own mortality in the time to come. For now, more pressing matters were at hand.\n\nAfter this short philosophical conversation between the two captains, the landing party continued exploring the island. The group could discover a spring but the dead body of Steng, the East India Trading Company spy who was killed with a fid, was lying in it. Barbossa tasted the water and found out that it was poisoned by the decaying corpse. After seeing Sao Feng's flagship, the Empress, arriving at the island and coming closer to the Black Pearl, Tai Huang and his men suddenly drew their weapons and turned on Barbossa's crew. Jack Sparrow immediately denied his captaincy and claimed that Barbossa is the captain. They were brought aboard the Black Pearl, where they met Sao Feng who had seized the Pearl immediately before their arrival. There, Turner's betrayal was revealed.\n\nSoon afterwards, the HMS Endeavour appeared. Jack Sparrow was transferred to the Endeavour and the rest of the crew including Barbossa remained aboard the Black Pearl, chained and guarded by Feng's soldiers and some Blue Coats led by Mercer. When Jack Sparrow spoke with Lord Beckett in the latter\u2019s cabin aboard the Endeavour, he declared that he was willing to deliver Barbossa and the other Pirate Lords to Beckett. Meanwhile, Barbossa was able to bargain with Feng by mentioning Calypso and making him believe that she is Elizabeth. Feng, already disappointed of the Company because Mercer broke their agreement and refused to give him the Black Pearl, was intrigued, and agreed to join Barbossa in opposition to the East India Trading Company in exchange for Elizabeth. Sao Feng's men freed the prisoners while Feng himself returned to the Empress together with Elizabeth. Barbossa's crew and the Chinese pirates turned on the East India Trading Company Marines aboard the Black Pearl and defeated them. During this skirmish Barbossa duelled briefly with Mercer, kicked him in the groin and made to finish him, but the cowardly Mercer escaped him by jumping overboard. After damaging the Endeavour with some shots, the Black Pearl made for Shipwreck Cove, once again co-captained by both Barbossa and Jack Sparrow who returned safely aboard the Pearl.\n\nBy the time the Black Pearl reached the coast of Shipwreck Island, Barbossa stood on the ship's forecastle, conversing with the Voodoo priestess, Tia Dalma, regarding their bargain. The mystic accused him of intending to betray her and therefore reminded him on that he was brought back from the dead by her power, and also, demonstrating her abilities by briefly decomposing Barbossa's right hand, cautioning him of his fate should he fail to keep his end of the bargain. Barbossa in turn reminded her that she, secretly the goddess Calypso, was the one who needed him; she resurrected Barbossa so he could help retrieve Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker and summon a meeting of the Brethren Court, since only the nine Pirate Lords had the power to free Calypso. To avoid the risk of the goddess reaching an accord with someone else, Barbossa ordered Pintel and Ragetti to lock Tia Dalma in the brig. Barbossa remained on deck, glancing at his right hand while contemplating his debt.\n\nAt Shipwreck Island, Barbossa served as the de facto leader and the Master of Ceremonies of the meeting, using a Chainshot as an improvised gavel.\n\nBarbossa declared the Fourth Brethren Court opened and ordered all the present Pirate Lords to lay their Pieces of Eight into a bowl, what all except Jack Sparrow did. He took Ragetti\u2019s eyeball and put it into the ball as well. Barbossa now had all but two Pieces of eight and waited for Sao Feng's arrival, but it was Elizabeth Swann who appeared in his place. She proclaimed that Feng is dead, killed by the Flying Dutchman, and Elizabeth has been made the Empress' new captain and the new Pirate Lord of Singapore. When asked what to do, Elizabeth proposed to face Lord Beckett's armada in an open sea battle, but Mistress Ching preferred staying at Shipwreck Cove and holding out a siege.\n\nBarbossa made a third proposal: He suggested that Calypso should be released so that the East India Trading Company would have a harder time controlling the seas. Tai Huang stated that Sao Feng supported this idea and Villanueva agreed with Barbossa as well, but the other lords opposed since they feared the sea goddess' power and vengeance. A fight broke out, but Barbossa stopped the violence by jumping on the table and firing a warning shot in the air.\n\nWhen the Pirate Lords were calm again, Jack Sparrow made a fourth proposal: He wanted to start a faint battle only in order to flee later. Barbossa reminded him that this would mean war and only a Pirate King had the right of declaring war. In order to proof this, he called on Captain Teague, the Keeper of the Code, who confirmed this. An election of the Pirate King was called out, during which Barbossa voted for himself, but since all the other Pirate Lords voted for themselves as well, excepted for Sparrow who supported Elizabeth, he lost the election to her.\n\nThe pirate fleet left Shipwreck Island and got ready to fight. Barbossa and Sparrow quarrelled as to who of them was the right captain of the Pearl, but when Cutler Beckett's armada appeared, Jack Sparrow called for a temporary parley, so the two captains Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa, along with Pirate King Elizabeth Swann, took a rowboat and went to a sandbar where they met with Lord Cutler Beckett, Captain Davy Jones and William Turner. Barbossa walked to the right of Elizabeth. On the sandbar, the six had a confrontation and during this confrontation, Jack Sparrow was traded for Will as part of the parley, and for Jack to repay his debt to Jones.\n\nElizabeth and Will walked away, while Barbossa had a deal with Sparrow: Barbossa attacked Sparrow with his sword and cut off his Piece of Eight (a coin woven into Moroccan beads) while calling Jack a \"blackguard\". Jack the monkey grabbed Sparrow's Piece of Eight, the last one to be collected, and secretly handed it to Barbossa. The three returned to the Black Pearl and prepared for the battle:\n\nBack at the Black Pearl Barbossa settled his debt with Tia Dalma and organized the ceremony of releasing Calypso from her human form. To do this, all nine Pieces of Eight were burned and Ragetti whispered the magic phrase in Tia Dalma's ear. When Calypso was released, Barbossa pleaded for her intervention, but Calypso refused to aid those who kept her imprisoned. Disappointed by this, Barbossa advised Elizabeth not to battle Lord Cutler Beckett, signifying that he was not going to die for her revenge, but Elizabeth held a speech which encouraged him as well as the rest of the crew. In the mean time Calypso showed her wrath by summoning a storm and forming a whirlpool by striking the sea with lightning.\n\nBarbossa, now undoubtedly the captain of the Black Pearl, which sailed under his colours, ordered to sail into battle with the Flying Dutchman. Elizabeth asked him, as the best steersman aboard, to man the helm, and Barbossa did it with alacrity. When the two ships entered the maelstrom, Barbossa ordered to prepare for the battle, but waited with firing the guns until the Pearl came near enough to the Dutchman and assumed the right position which allowed to use her guns most efficiently. Then he gave the order for firing a full broadside. The two ships rotated in the whirlpool and fired at each other until they finally came close enough for boarding.\n\nDuring the following battle Barbossa stayed on his position, the bridge of the Black Pearl and fought numerous East India Trading Company Marines and Fish-men, including Urchin and Jelly, in addition to Morey whom he killed by beheading and stabbing. During the battle Will and Elizabeth asked him, as the ship\u2019s captain, to join them in matrimony. Still fighting against numerous enemies, Barbossa performed a rushed wedding ceremony. When Will stabbed Jones\u2019s heart and the Dutchman began to sink in the whirlpool, Barbossa ordered Pintel and Ragetti to fire a chain shot on the mast tops of the two ships which were jammed together in order to uncouple the ship from the sinking Dutchman and when this was done he sailed the Black Pearl safely out of the dissolving swirl.\n\nDespite the Dutchman's defeat, Beckett's armada still had to be dealt with. Jack Sparrow escaped from the Dutchman and came aboard the Black Pearl to become her captain once more. He ordered to continue the attack, but Barbossa refused. During their conversation the Dutchman resurfaced again, now with Will Turner as its new captain. Delighted about this unexpected arrival of a new ally, Barbossa agreed to attack. Sparrow and Barbossa sailed the Pearl towards Beckett's flagship, the HMS Endeavour. The two galleons boxed the Endeavour in and attacked it from both sides, annihilating the ship along with its captain. The remaining ships of Beckett's fleet, seeing the destruction of their flagship, the death of their supreme commander and with the Dutchman out of their control, retreated from the battle. Barbossa and all the other pirates celebrated their victory.\n\nWhen after the end of the battle Elizabeth Turner left the Black Pearl to spend the one day her husband could spend on land with him, Barbossa was the first in the row of crewmembers who took leave from her. He smiled to her and, ironically, he had to address her as \"Turner\", which is how Elizabeth first (falsely) introduced herself to him.\n\nAfter the pirates' victory, the Black Pearl sailed back to Tortuga. While Jack was in port impressing women, Barbossa rallied the crew, left the sleeping Joshamee Gibbs on the pier and commandeered the Black Pearl once again, planning to use the charts he obtained from Sao Feng to find the Fountain of Youth. However, some time later, when Barbossa was feeding Jack the monkey on the bridge of the Black Pearl, a group of crewmen consisting of Pintel, Ragetti, Marty, Mullroy and Murtogg, who all felt unwell because they left Jack Sparrow behind, demanded him to show them the charts in order to calm them. Barbossa promised them \"Eternal life\" and agreed to show the charts, but when he furled the charts he was dismayed to find that Jack has cut the middle out of the charts.\n\nWith the map to the Fountain of Youth stolen, Barbossa and his crew resumed their pirate ways. During an attack on an Italian ship, Barbossa came in possession of the diary of Galileo Galilei, a book with the instructions how to find Poseidon's tomb and his legendary trident, but he considered the astronomer's writings nothing but worthless scribblings. Some time later, Barbossa's lover Margaret Smyth gave birth to his daughter and died, leaving him alone with a child. Barbossa named the baby Carina, after the brightest star in the North. Knowing it would be much better for the baby if she lived her life as far away from him as possible, Barbossa left her at the doorstep of an orphanage in England with nothing but her name and Galileo's diary, hoping that the ruby on the cover would one day afford her some easy life.\n\nApproximately fifteen years after the battle of Calypso's maelstrom, while the Black Pearl was sailing through the coast of Hispaniola, Barbossa's crew was suddenly attacked without warning by the Queen Anne's Revenge, the infamous vessel captained by the notorious pirate Blackbeard. The Pearl was peppered by cannonfire from the Revenge. Then the sea beneath the Pearl began to roil as the Pearl itself was pitching and yawing to where the ship itself couldn't be maneuvered. Witnessing all of this tempted Barbossa to give the order he thought he would never give\u2014\"Abandon ship\".\n\nBut it was too late, as Blackbeard used his sword to turn the Black Pearl against Barbossa and his crew. Every plank, rail and spar aboard the Pearl began to creak a hellish noise as the rigging came to life. Barbossa's men were tangled by the ropes, unable to fight as they were wrapped around like snakes. One of the ropes would wrap around Barbossa's right leg. Not wanting his fate changed or be mastered by anyone but himself, Barbossa used his sword to cut off his own leg. Barbossa was able to escape the brutal attack, but with the knowledge of having lost both the Black Pearl and his right leg to Blackbeard. Although having narrowly escaped Blackbeard's attack on the Pearl, Barbossa had no knowledge of the fate of his ship, having only believed that it was sunk in battle.\n\nFrom that night on, Barbossa abandoned his search for the Fountain of Youth; his goal now was to get his revenge on the man who took the Pearl and his leg: Blackbeard. However, because he was without a ship and crew, Barbossa needed help to achieve this plan. Having lost his leg, Barbossa would have very few options, as his standing among other pirates would be lowered. So to ensure his revenge, Barbossa approached the British and offered his services to the Crown.\n\nThrough unknown circumstances, Barbossa received a Royal Pardon and became a reformed pirate, serving as a privateer in the employ of England. At some point during this time, Barbossa would have started an investigation, with an obsessive passion, in which he gained information to help him in his pursuit of Blackbeard. It was through these investigations that Barbossa would learn at least the basics on Blackbeard, including his own obsession to find the Fountain of Youth as well as the importance of his sword. As time passed from departing from his past pirate ways and a seemingly new respect for authority, Barbossa had won the trust of the British Crown. The ex-pirate soon became a trusted advisor of King George II and was given command as captain of the HMS Providence, the pride of the British Royal Navy. By the time of his new-found captaincy, Barbossa began to wear a wooden leg, which contained a hidden rum supply, and used a wooden crutch.\n\nBarbossa would still be serving as a privateer after King George's interest in finding the Fountain of Youth before King Ferdinand and the Spanish Armada, which Barbossa humbly agreed to take part in. After Jack Sparrow was forced to meet with King George in St. James's Palace, he was offered to guide an expedition to the Fountain under Barbossa, who believed that Sparrow could be a useful ally. It was at this meeting that Barbossa and Jack had a brief reunion, in which Jack complemented Barbossa's new pirate lifestyle, though Barbossa corrected him by revealing that he was now a privateer in service to the King. Jack then asked about what became of the Black Pearl, Barbossa only revealed, without getting too far into detail, that he lost the Pearl and that his beloved vessel was sunk. Barbossa watched as Jack angrily reacted in hearing that news and the King's Royal Guards had to restrain him to stop him from attacking Barbossa. Before King George and Barbossa resumed their order of business, Jack made one of his legendary escapes. Barbossa watched as Jack, after making fun of his wig, took out some of the guards as he escaped the palace's banquet room. When the King reacted to his escape, Barbossa assured the issue was going to be handled. However, Jack was able to escape from the guards.\n\nWith the pressing issue of the Spanish outdistancing the British towards the Fountain of Youth, the King sent Barbossa to prepare the HMS Providence to sail in their quest for the Fountain. To prepare for the voyage, Barbossa rallied a large crew for the Providence, including officers Theodore Groves and Gillette. But, since Jack Sparrow escaped, Barbossa needed someone else who might know the way to the Fountain. So Barbossa carried a noose as he greeted Joshamee Gibbs in the Tower of London. Barbossa threatened to hang Gibbs unless if he would offer him anything for their voyage to the Fountain. Gibbs revealed he had Sao Feng's map in his possession and, after Barbossa asked for the map, burned it. This action forced Barbossa to have Gibbs recruited as the navigator of the Providence, after the latter revealed that he was able to study the map and had memorized every route to the Fountain of Youth.\n\nAs the journey progressed, Barbossa had Gibbs brought to him, as he needed a heading. Gibbs was sure they were on the right course, as he saw three galleons of the Spanish Armada. Realizing that this fleet was led by the Spaniard, Barbossa immediately ordered the crew to get to their battle stations. But before they could fire their cannons, the Spanish fleet simply passed by the Providence without fire. Barbossa deduced that their mission to find the Fountain was why the Spanish didn't attack, and that they weren't worth the time to attack. Knowing that they have fallen behind, Barbossa was now more determined to reach their destination.\n\nAt some point in the voyage, Barbossa was enjoying a silver plate bearing finely sliced apples, feasting with tiny bites. As he ate his meal, Groves came to him, reporting rumors about the ship's destination amongst the crew. Barbossa told Groves to continue on. But seeing that Groves hasn't moved on prompted Barbossa to reveal their immediate course in their quest, Whitecap Bay. Gibbs came in to ask if the stories of the bay were true and, after Barbossa ordered him to say it, asked if the journey to the bay could involve mermaids. Barbossa revealed that they were indeed sailing there. The crew then started to fear the worst, even leading one of its members to jump overboard, whom Barbossa believed to be a deserter. However, Barbossa managed to inspire confidence into the men by asking if they were King's men. And so the Providence set sail for Whitecap Bay.\n\nSoon the Providence would arrived to Whitecap Bay. As a storm erupted, Barbossa brought a team ashore, consisting of a handful of men, including his officers, Groves and Gillette, and Gibbs. While Barbossa's men found remains of deceased mermaids from the recent attack on the bay, Gibbs warned Barbossa to give up the madness. Barbossa stated that he couldn't, saying that \"footsteps lie before him\"; when Gillette noted that it was actually just footstep due to Barbossas's peg leg, the captain's only response was an annoyed grimace. As Groves warned Barbossa that they must hasten, the remaining crew aboard the Providence fell under attack by the enraged mermaids.\n\nKnowing that they were dead already, Barbossa ordered a heading from Gibbs. Groves, being concerned for the men aboard, urged Barbossa to help them, but Barbossa denied the idea while pointing his pistol at Groves to change his mind. As Barbossa tried getting a heading from Gibbs, the Providence soon fell to its attackers and sunk beneath the waves. With their ship ultimately destroyed, Gibbs found their next heading and the crew continued the journey through the jungle island.\n\nContinuing their journey through dark jungles, Barbossa and Gibbs complained about it being nice to have a map or a ship. Barbossa ordered everyone in the crew to stop as he carefully takes a little, but deadly poisonous dart frog from Gibbs' shoulder. He put it in a jar with the other frogs that he recently started collecting. As Gibbs stared in a bewilderment, Barbossa asks if an old man can't have his own hobby. He ordered the crew to push on in their search, telling them that they could sleep when they were dead. Looking at his collection of frogs, he said to himself that fortune continued to favor him.\n\nLater, Barbossa left his crew behind to find Chalices of Cartagena, which were hidden aboard the Santiago, the ship of Ponce de León. The Chalices were a key element of the ritual for the Fountain of Youth, and Barbossa knew that Blackbeard had to find them. He discovered the Santiagoon the edge of the cliff and entered the captain's cabin, waiting for the arrival of Blackbeard. However, Barbossa was only to discover that Blackbeard sent Jack Sparrow to get the Chalices.\n\nSeeing that they were both after the same prize, Jack wanted to fight Barbossa. But the balance of the Santiago was so unstable that when they moved, the ship dangerously leaned. As Barbossa and Jack put the ship into balance, a chest slid from under the bed. They knew that the chest held the Chalices, but before they could reach it, the ship went unbalanced again. After once again getting the ship into balance, Barbossa and Jack decided to open the chest together. However, they only discovered that there was nothing inside, except for two stones instead of the two Chalices. They both realized that the Spanish already took the Chalices. Taking a look at a map in the hands of Ponce de León's corpse, Barbossa found where the Spanish would make their camp.\n\nBarbossa and Jack later found the location of the Spanish camp where they met up with Barbossa's men. Jack and Gibbs had a brief reunion before the crew continued with their goal. As the crew made it to a stopping point near the Spanish camp, Jack stated that he would take the mission from there on account of Barbossa's condition of having one leg. Barbossa however stated that he'd accompany Jack. Barbossa ordered Groves for the men to stay back and wait for the signal.\n\nGoing through palm trees and bushes, and waded through a lake, Barbossa and Jack were able to sneak over to some bushes to investigate a tent where the Spaniard was conversing with his men. Barbossa and Jack then notice the Chalices right on the table where the tent was and crawled through bushes towards them. After Jack said that his sword smelled funny, Barbossa revealed that his sword was poisoned from the innards of poisonous frogs. As they stood up to plan the next step in their infiltration, Barbossa looked around to calculate an escape route, thinking that's how Jack's successful escape plans work. Jack however suggested to improvise. Barbossa and Jack were able to swipe the Chalices and knock out a Spanish officer. However, after attempting to just walk out and fighting off some Spanish soldiers, the two were captured by a dozen Spanish soldiers with muskets.\n\nNow prisoners of the Spanish, Barbossa and Jack were stripped of their possessions and tied around palm trees, sitting facing each other. Barbossa reached forward, hands still tied, and works to unscrew his peg leg and opens his rum supply. As Barbossa took a gulp, Jack reacts to this by his desire for one. Barbossa then hands the wooden leg over to Jack, who toasts it to revenge, revealing that he knew of Barbossa's true intentions aboard the Santiago\u2014to confront Blackbeard. Though denying it at first, Barbossa came out with it, relaying on Blackbeard's attack on the Black Pearl and how his leg was lost. Barbossa screws his leg back into place on its harness as he admitted no interest for King George or \"tavern yarns that give hope for a healed limb\", but was willing to give his left arm just for a chance to take on Blackbeard: the only reason he wouldn't give his right arm is because it was needed to kill Blackbeard with the blade of his poisoned sword. Jack assured Barbossa that he'll get the chance, finally having his hands freed.\n\nWith haste, Jack scootches up the trunk and climbs upwards a palm tree. Barbossa looks on Jack's escape attempt with admiration as Jack reached the top and was suddenly slingshoted onto another palm tree. Patrolling Spanish soldiers witnessed the escape and took out their weapons and spread out to find Jack. As Barbossa struggled to get free, Groves appeared with Jack and Barbossa's weapons, taking Jack's distraction as the signal, and sets Barbossa free. Barbossa and Groves then fled back to the rest of Barbossa's crew. Jack appeared with the Chalices in hand. With the Chalices retrieved, Jack and Barbossa quickly made way in their new joint venture, in which Jack would help Barbossa get his chance of revenge against Blackbeard.\n\nWhile Jack rejoined Blackbeard and his crew, Barbossa and his crew followed them from a distance. When the pirates found the Fountain of Youth, Barbossa and his crew made a surprising entrance, out of the Fountain's foggy environment, in which Barbossa finally confronts Blackbeard. As Barbossa pulled out his sword, he declared Blackbeard as his prisoner, for numerous crimes including the loss of his leg. Blackbeard asked Barbossa if he was to face his sword, in which Barbossa said he would, being far away from his ship. Blackbeard, believing Barbossa was the \"one-legged man\" from his prophesied death, believed Fate had come to him. However, Blackbeard didn't want to go down without a fight. And so a battle ensued as both Barbossa and Blackbeard's crew started to fight each other, with their captains in a fierce duel to the death.\n\nIn their deadlock battle, Barbossa fought Blackbeard, as he blocked the pirate's attacks with his sword and crutch. They continued slashing at each other until Gillette got in the way and was fatally stabbed by Blackbeard, briefly interrupting their duel. Gillette's body fell onto Barbossa, who immediately pushed it aside to resume fighting with Blackbeard. They fought evenly throughout their duel, until Blackbeard grabbed Barbossa's crutch and chopped it in half, leaving Barbossa slightly unbalanced. Blackbeard laughed and said that there could have been more of a fight, to which Barbossa retailated by poking Blackbeard in the face with the remaing half of his crutch. Despite being at a disadvantage, Barbossa was still able to fight, until Blackbeard tripped Barbossa to the ground, where he couldn't get back up due to his peg leg. To Blackbeard's frustration, Barbossa had a smile on his face, which infuriated him as he was about to finish him off. But Blackbeard wouldn't be given that chance, as Barbossa pointed out to him, as he gazed upon unwanted visitors\u2014the Spanish.\n\nBarbossa and Blackbeard watched as The Spaniard and his men appeared out of the fog, slowly stopping the fight at the Fountain of Youth. After killing Groves and taking the Chalices from Angelica, Blackbeard's daughter, the Spaniard declared that the Fountain was to be destroyed and smashed the two Chalices thrown them in a deep pool nearby. As the Spanish began destroying the Fountain, the Spaniard confronted Blackbeard, calling him a fool for seeking what only faith can provide. Blackbeard debunked that claim, saying that for faith there is enough to see, but enough to blind. Barbossa took this opportunity to cut Blackbeard's wrist with his poisonous sword. As the bewildered Blackbeard turned around, Barbossa ran him through with his sword, saying that his act was for the Black Pearl.\n\nSeeing that he was mortally wounded, Angelica ran to her father's side to remove the sword, but cut herself in the process. Barbossa informed them that the blade of his sword was poisoned, saying that he wouldn't have faced Blackbeard without a \"little venomous advantage\". As the Spanish continued destroying the temple around the Fountain, Barbossa walked to pick up Blackbeard's sword, claiming it along with his ship and crew as payment for his lost leg. And so Barbossa left Blackbeard to die at the Fountain, followed by Blackbeard's human crew.\n\nHaving taken the revenge he wanted from Blackbeard, Barbossa made his way across the huge barren rocks, backed by what is left of Blackbeard's pirate crew, including Ezekiel, Salaman, Garheng, Scrum, and the Cabin Boy. Anchored in the bay of the island, lied the Queen Anne's Revenge. Barbossa declared the Revenge his new ship.\n\nWhen he came aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Barbossa had changed into his full pirate regalia. As Barbossa took the ship's helm, the Cabin Boy approached him with an old wide-brimmed black hat\u2014the very hat Barbossa had lost in battle\u2014which he found belowdecks. Barbossa takes the hat and flips it as he places it on top of his head. He then draws his new sword, causing the lines to whip through the air and the sails unfurl, on their own accord. The crew looks in wonder, as Barbossa points the sword straight ahead, causing the Revenge to sail forward at full speed.\n\nAs the Revenge sailed, Barbossa sheathed his sword and yelled orders to his new crew, who approve him as their new captain. Barbossa became a notorious pirate captain once again as he reached into his coat and pulled out his Letters of Marque, saying that the Crown served him well, and ripped them up as he told the crew of their next destination. The papers flew through the air as Barbossa had the Revenge set sail for Tortuga.\n\nNow a pirate once again, and with Blackbeard's ship and sword in his possession, Barbossa was literally unstoppable. Quickly he assembled a pirate fleet of ten ships, with the Queen Anne's Revenge serving as his flagship. He became the terror of the Seven Seas, pillaging the wealthy trade ships and filling the holds of the Queen Anne's Revenge with treasures beyond most men's wildest dreams. With the power of the Sword of Triton, Barbossa finally fulfilled his old desire of living the life of a rich rogue. He surrounded himself with riches, dressing himself in finest uniforms he could steal, and even replaced his wooden peg leg with one made of gold.\n\nAt some point, Barbossa saved the witch Shansa from hanging. Even though he couldn't pay her way out of jail, she turned her prison cell in St. Martin into a sanctum sanctorum, where she would devote herself to all kinds of magic. Barbossa would regularly visit her by bribing the guards, and she returned the favor by cursing his enemies.\n\nBarbossa's reign of terror began to shatter when three of his ships were destroyed by a mysterious attacker which seemed to have no interest in riches and left only one man from each crew to tell the tales. When Mullroy and Murtogg made him understand that Capitán Armando Salazar, who had once swore to eradicate all pirates from the surface of the Earth, could be the cause of this, Barbossa went to see the witch Shansa. She confirmed him that Salazar had returned and was looking for Jack Sparrow, the pirate responsible for his demise. In order to keep his fleet from being wiped out, Barbossa chose to confront Salazar in person. The Queen Anne's Revenge was soon boarded by a ghostly crew against which the pirates were defenseless. Barbossa informed Salazar that he could lead him to Jack Sparrow in exchange for his own safety. After killing several of Barbossa's crewmen, Salazar took Barbossa and the remaining pirates aboard the Silent Mary.\n\nSalazar and Barbossa tracked down Sparrow to Hangman's Bay, with Barbossa barely escaping being killed by Salazar as he found Sparrow at the last moments of the deal he had concluded with the Spanish captain. Since Salazar and his men could not set foot on land because of their curse, Barbossa and his men went to find Sparrow as he was on the verge of forcefully marrying Beatrice Kelly. Barbossa and his men quickly got rid of Pig Kelly and his men who had captured Sparrow. When Mullroy and Murtogg asked him if they should not turn Sparrow over to Salazar, Barbossa retorted that he would instead use Sparrow in order to find the Trident of Poseidon, whose power would be used to destroy Salazar so that Barbossa would be in control of the oceans once again.\n\nSince he had lost his ship, Barbossa needed a new one to fulfill his plans and used the powers of the Sword of Triton to release the Black Pearl from its bottle. He then held Jack at gunpoint and took control of the ship, tying Jack Sparrow to the foremast and Henry Turner and Carina Smyth to the wooden stand for ship's bell on the quarterdeck. At first Barbossa tried to find the way to the Trident of Poseidon on his own, ignoring Carina's warnings that his maps were incomplete. However, when a lightning illuminated a dark shape of another ship in pursuit of the Pearl, Barbossa realized that he needed Smyth to take them to the island where they would find the Trident and thus released her, ordering his men to let her sail the ship to their destination.\n\nBarbossa noticed that Smyth was carrying the diary of Galileo Galilei, an object that he had once possessed. While discussing its origin with Smyth and how she got it from her father, a shocked Barbossa discovered that Carina Smyth was actually his own daughter and walked off. He pulled out Jack's compass and when it pointed toward Carina he realized that she was his \"lost treasure\" that Shansa talked about. When Jack Sparrow figured that as well, he confronted Barbossa on the matter, and the older pirate told him how he left Carina as an infant in the orphanage after her mother's death, hoping that the ruby from the diary would afford her some easy life. When Jack attempted to blackmail Barbossa the old pirate threatened him with cutting off his tongue, and Jack the monkey finally gagged Jack with a piece of cloth.\n\nJust a moment later the British warship Essex appeared in the dark, not far away from the starboard side of the Pearl. Barbossa ordered the crew to fight to the last, as he didn't intend to let the Pearl be taken from him again. However, before the Essex could fire a broadside the Silent Mary suddenly crashed into it, cutting the British vessel in half. The Spanish ghosts boarded the Pearl and a fierce battle ensued, during which Barbossa valiantly fought against the ghosts. However, he knew if they didn't find land soon he and all his men would die. The battle was ended when Smyth managed to take the Pearl to the island where they believed they would find the Trident of Poseidon. Barbossa said that finding the Trident was their only chance to save Turner as well since he had been captured by Salazar.\n\nBarbossa, Jack Sparrow and Carina Smyth set foot on the land and began searching for the Trident of Poseidon. Smyth quickly noticed that one of the ruby stones who were supposed to give them the location of the artifact was not shining like the others, as it lacked the fragment which decorated the Diary of Galileo Galilei. Barbossa gave Smyth the fragment that had been previously stolen by his monkey Jack, telling her to find the Trident for her father. Once Smyth put the fragment in place, the sea was torn in half and Sparrow and Smyth fell on the bottom of the ocean while Barbossa managed to remain at the surface.\n\nWith the arrival of Salazar and Sparrow and Smyth being in danger, Barbossa returned on the Black Pearl and sailed it right on the edge of the ocean's rift. There, he ordered his men to lower the anchor as he was grabbing it, getting down into the open abyss to rescue Sparrow, Smyth and Turner, whose body had been controlled by Salazar but freed of his control once the Spanish captain had seized the Trident. With the Trident broken, Salazar and his men were returned to their human form as the ocean rift was closing, threatening to drown them all.\n\nAfter the tridents destruction, the walls of water slowly began to close in around them. When all had seem lost, Captain Hector Barbossa came swinging in from the Black Pearls anchor, urging Sparrow, Henry ,and Carina to come aboard. They all successfully grabbed the anchor's chain including Salazar and two of his crew members. As Carina began to climb the anchor, she slipped, but was saved by Barbossa. By doing so, Barbossa revealed a tattoo on his arm that had the same shape of a schematics drawn in the Diary of Galileo Galilei. Upon seeing this, Smyth understood that Barbossa was her father and asked him what she meant to him, to which he responded \"treasure\". Carina looked at her father in shock as he smiled. However, Barbossa realized that Salazar was slowly getting closer and closer toward his daughter with his sword drawn, threatening his daughter's life. Sparrow took Turner's sword and shouted \"Hector!\" as he threw him the blade. After assuring Carina was safely on the anchor, Barbossa grabbed the hilt of the sword and let go of the anchor. As he fell through the air Carina and Barbossa locked eyes, before piercing the dangling Salazar through the back with his sword and the villainous Spaniard began to fall toward the depths of the ocean, letting out a scream of horror, which was soon silenced from him landing face first on to the anchor below, then disappearing through the water. Barbossa and Carina locked eyes one last time, Barbossa having a look of pleasure and peace, knowing his daughter had finally made it to safety. Carina looked at her father with sheer horror as he was then consumed by the surrounding waves out of her sight. Jack looked as if he was sent into pure shock as he watched his rival be consumed by the waters below. Captain Hector Barbossa's notorious reign of piracy, had finally come to an end, making the ultimate sacrifice to save what he held dearest to him, his \"treasure\".\n\nWhen Jack Sparrow, Henry Turner and Carina Smyth safely made it aboard Black Pearl, they both looked down toward the now calm sea. Jack sighed and looked down \"Pirate's life, Hector....\" Carina's eyes filled with tears as she was still trying to comprehend what had just happened. Murtogg and Mullroy removed their hats from their heads and placed them on their hearts, honoring their fallen Captain. Gibbs then followed in their footsteps and placed his hand on his heart, appearing to be effected dearly by it, even Jack the monkey joined in honoring the fallen Captain. The entire crew of the Black Pearl mourned the loss of Captain Hector Barbossa, who sacrificed everything to save those he held dearest to him. Although all had seemed loss, Barbossa had left something behind, a daughter to carry on his name.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hector_Barbossa"}}

Instead of being vicious and manipulative like the rest of her kind, she was reserved and compassionate. Other than being hostile when the pirates captured her at Whitecap Bay, Syrena displayed no traits of vicious behavior and does not attempt to kill any human, or even show the desire to, even though she did hiss at her captors, showing at least some hostility. It is unknown if she ever displayed behaviour like her sister mermaids in the past and it changed because of what she sensed in Philip, or if she was different all along from the other mermaids and never was vicious.

She fell in love with Phillip, who saved her life, making her the only known mermaid ever to fall in love with a human."],"name":"Syrena","description":"Not much is known about Syrena's early life in Whitecap Bay. Syrena wasn't a typical mermaid; while the other mermaids are quite dangerous, she was rather timid.\n\nDuring the quest for the Fountain of Youth, Blackbeard's crew had a mission to lure a mermaid for their tears, as a mermaid's tear was needed for the ritual of the Fountain. The mermaid hunt would lead to a fierce battle between mermaids and pirates. After the bay's remote lighthouse exploded, while the other mermaids flee, Syrena saved the missionary Philip Swift from being crushed by falling debris, pulling his legs out from under him. However, as she swam away, she became trapped under a piece of debris herself.\n\nThough dazed, Philip noticed the mermaid's tail flipping around. He pulled the debris out of the way and, reaching his sword, drove the blade through her tail. She rose out of the water and stared at Philip, their eyes meeting. Seeing the fear in her eyes, Philip pulled his sword from her tail. Something passed between them; an understanding, kindred spirits. Suddenly a net came down over the mermaid, and she was held by the Blackbeard's zombie quartermaster. Now the pirates had caught a live mermaid. Philip had guilt, as he couldn't deny his part in her capture. Syrena hissed fiercely as Blackbeard ordered his crew to make for a protected cove.\n\nBlackbeard and his crew began searching for the Fountain of Youth through a jungle-infested island. As mermaids' tears would not keep for long, she had to be brought along so that a tear could be harvested fresh; she was carried around in a large water tank carried by four members of Blackbeard's crew. Part way through the journey the tank was broken, and Syrena fell to the ground, losing her aquatic form and assuming a human shape. Not used to walking on two feet, and wounded from when Phillip stabbed her fin, she was a stumbling, vulnerable figure. Philip Swift gave her his shirt to cover her and carried her the rest of the way through the jungle.\n\nDuring the journey, Syrena fell deeply in love with Philip, who she thought was different than the other crewmen, being a protector. It was Philip who gave the mermaid her name of \"Syrena\", in order to make the pirates see her as a person and not a creature. As a man of God, he was the only crewmember who treated her with any dignity or respect.\n\nShortly after arriving into the Jungle Pools, Blackbeard tried to force Syrena to cry by showing the remains of other mermaids, telling her of how they were left to die a slow, painful death. However, Syrena would not yield, prompting Blackbeard and his crew to figure out a way to torture Syrena for the tear. Philip spoke out against Blackbeard, showing his care for Syrena. Realizing that the two fancied each other, Blackbeard threatened to have Philip killed unless Syrena brought forth a tear. As Scrum held a vial to Syrena's eye, Syrena simply stared with only sadness. As a result, Blackbeard tossed a knife to the Quartermaster, who seemingly slit Philip's throat. As Philip's body was dumped in a nearby ravine, Syrena was left at the pools.\n\nSyrena lay tied to the stakes, half immersed in the water, until a miracle happened: Philip returned to Syrena and untied her, setting her free. Amazed in wonder at Philip rescuing her, Syrena let loose a tear of joy. Philip told her she was different from the others, just as Syrena had said about him earlier. Blackbeard's crew suddenly appeared and managed to get a tear from Syrena. Finally having the tear he needed, Blackbeard ordered Syrena to be rebound back in the Jungle Pools, leaving her to die.\n\nAfter escaping from the Fountain of Youth, Philip went to save her and she was able to escape. She managed to find the two Chalices of Cartagena in the waters of the Fountain and gave them to Jack Sparrow. She told him to not let her tear go to waste. She then went to find the injured Philip and he asked for her forgiveness. Bringing him underwater, Syrena kissed Philip to heal him and give him the ability to breathe underwater. They swam off together through the pools to freedom. Her further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Syrena"}}

As the mermaids didn't come, Gunner forced Scrum to sing so he could attract them. Scrum's song, My Jolly Sailor Bold, soon attracted the attention of Tamara, who appeared at the end of the longboat.\n\nThough some of the men were afraid, including Ezekiel, who tried to kill her, Scrum tried to communicate with her. It was at that moment that Tamara continued Scrum's song. Enchanted with Tamara's beauty, Scrum came closer to her to kiss her, despite the warnings of his colleagues.

A beautiful woman of mixed race and one of the most capable pirate captains of her time, she was dangerous and competent enough to attract the attention of the notorious adventurer Captain Jack Sparrow.","Like almost all Pirate Lords, Esmeralda had a unique pirate flag. Her flag was black with the white skeleton dressed in a skirt holding a cutlass and an hourglass.","Esmeralda was highly educated and as such, she was able to speak several languages. Aside from Spanish, which was her native language, she fluently spoke English, Aztec, and French."],"name":"Esmeralda Maria Consuela Anna de Sevilla","description":"Esmeralda was born on a plantation owned by the Spanish nobleman Don Rafael, somewhere on the Spanish Main. Her father was Don Rafael's son, and her mother was Quiauhxochitl, a native girl of Aztec origin. Her parents gave her two names, one Spanish, Esmeralda, and one Aztec, Quiauhxochitl, after her mother.\n\nUnlike the neighboring dons, Don Rafael treated his native servants well. That earned him hatred from his neighbors. One day, while Don Rafael was absent, the angry dons organized a night raid on Don Rafael's land. Esmeralda's parents were killed during the raid, and she was barely saved by her Aztec nurse. She was five years old at that time.\n\nLeft with nothing but a ship, a granddaughter, and a few loyal servants, Don Rafael sent Esmeralda to a convent school in Barcelona in Spain, so she could become a fine lady. He joined the Caribbean pirates, eventually becoming the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea.\n\nEsmeralda hadn't been in school for a month before she knew that she wasn't destined for the court of His Majesty King of Spain. She applied herself to her lessons, but she went without sweets so she could pay for fencing lessons in secret. When she was fifteen, she escaped from the school and returned to her grandfather. Don Rafael brought her to Shipwreck Island, hoping that the exposure to pirate life would scare her enough to return to Spain. But she liked the pirate life, and stayed with him on his ship, the Venganza, to learn some pirating.\n\nNot long after she arrived to Shipwreck Island, Esmeralda met Jack Sparrow, a nine year old boy, son of Captain Edward Teague, Keeper of the Code. On one occasion, Jack teasingly yanked her braids, but she pounced him and gave him a thrashing that left him bruised for days.\n\nOver the next eleven years, Esmeralda was schooled in sword fighting by her grandfather, who made of her a formidable fighter. She also learned everything she needed to know about sailing.\n\nWhen the Venganza was docked in Tortuga, Don Rafael encountered Hector Barbossa, a pirate captain whose ship, the Cobra, was destroyed by the mysterious rogue pirates. The Venganza sailed to Shipwreck Island, so that Don Rafael and Barbossa could inform Teague about that act of the violation of the Code of the Pirate Brethren.\n\nDuring the meeting of the Pirate Lords, Esmeralda was reunited with Jack Sparrow, who became quite charming since the last time they met. She also met Jack's friend Christophe-Julien de Rapièr, captain of the brigantine La Vipère. A few days later, Esmeralda and Jack began to go on picnics to a small beach on the outer side of Shipwreck Cove. For two weeks, they enjoyed each other's company, spending their time in fencing, swimming, sharing their food and drinking Don Rafael's wine. Christophe soon joined them on their picnics, and he taught both young pirates fencing. However, Esmeralda didn't like Christophe's company, because he never missed a chance to touch her.\n\nOne day, after hearing from them about Marie Seymour, the wife of Steve Seymour, the owner of the Drunken Lady tavern, Esmeralda asked Jack and Christophe to take her there. Jack and Christophe took her to the tavern, and she became a good friend with Marie.\n\nHowever, a few days later, she found Jack rowing alone in the boat they used to go to their picnics. When she got into the boat, she admitted to Jack that she wanted to move it to some other inlet where Christophe couldn't find it, so they could continue to have their picnics alone. Both Esmeralda and Jack admitted that they like each other, and they shared their first kiss.\n\nDespite showing their interest for each other, Jack and Esmeralda decided to search around the Cove for the rogue pirate ship which was sighted by the pirate One Tooth Tommy a few days earlier. Jack had found Tommy's dead body two days earlier and he suspected his death wasn't accidental. They rowed around the Cove, looking at all pirate ships docked there, until they found the sloop which matched the description given by Hector Barbossa. But that sloop was the Koldunya, the ship of Boris \"Borya\" Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea.\n\nShocked with such discovery, they returned to Shipwreck City, where Esmeralda vent to the Venganza to inform her grandfather and Captain Teague, while Jack searched around the city for Captain Barbossa. Some time later, they all met at the dock, where Barbossa told Captain Teague that Borya's ship looks identical to the one which sunk the Cobra.\n\nTeague and Don Rafael decided to search the Koldunya, while Esmeralda and Jack stayed on the dock. A few minutes later, Teague and Don Rafael, accompanied by Borya, returned to the city, heading for the Pirate Hall.\n\nCaptain Teague called for an official court of inquiry, and Esmeralda and Jack joined the Pirate Lords in the Pirate Hall. They were both called as witnesses, and though they brought certain evidence against Borya, it wasn't enough to convict Borya. The Pirate Lords decided to summon Davy Jones, the lord of the sea, who could tell them if Borya was guilty or not.\n\nThe Pirate Lords and all the witnesses assembled on the Troubadour, Teague's flagship, where the Brethren Court spoke the magical incantation which brought Jones onboard. Esmeralda was terrified by Jones' monstrous appearance, but the supernatural captain of the Flying Dutchman confirmed Borya's guilt. He also said that another rogue pirate, commander of a brigantine, is also present at the Cove. Borya was immediately sentenced to hang with his whole crew.\n\nA few hours later, Esmeralda and Jack went to the Drunken Lady, where they discovered that Marie was molested by Christophe, who was apparently drunk. They also encountered Barbossa, who told them that Borya revealed Christophe as one of the rogues under his command.\n\nEsmeralda and Jack couldn't believe that Christophe was guilty, and Jack decided to help him escape. Esmeralda and Jack went to the Troubadour, where they sneaked into Teague's cabin to steal the keys to the dungeons of Shipwreck City from the Prison Dog. They were interrupted by the sudden arrival of Teague, and they had to hide in the pantry. Pressed up against each other, Jack and Esmeralda began to kiss and touch, and after Teague departed, they surrendered to their passion. A few moments later, they stole the keys and left the cabin. While Esmeralda returned to her cabin on the Venganza, Jack went to the dungeons to free Christophe.\n\nThe next morning, Esmeralda heard that Jack helped both Christophe's and Borya's crew to escape, and that he escaped from the island with them, making himself a traitor in the eyes of the Brethren. Esmeralda couldn't believe that, and, after disguising herself as the cabin boy, she took her sword and pistol and went to the Drunken Lady, hoping that he'll appear in the tavern sooner or later and clear his name. She waited for the whole day, but Jack never came. Feeling betrayed, Esmeralda decided to shoot Jack the next time she sees him.\n\nTwo years after Jack Sparrow's escape from Shipwreck Island, Don Rafael was killed by Christophe-Julien de Rapièr. Esmeralda wasn't onboard the Venganza when it happened. She was informed by her grandfather's crew about his demise, and that she is the new captain of the Venganza as well as the new Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea. Esmeralda became a successful pirate captain, and soon earned the nickname Doña Pirata.\n\nApproximately a year after Don Rafael's death, Esmeralda was in Barbados, an island controlled by the British in the Eastern Caribbean, impersonating a Spanish noblewoman. She encountered Jack, now a sailor in the employment of the East India Trading Company. They recognized each other, and though Esmeralda was angry at Jack, she gave him the chance to explain what exactly happened that night at Shipwreck Cove. He told her that he was betrayed by Christophe who freed Borya and his men and then forced him onto his ship. In return, Esmeralda told Jack about her grandfather's death and how she became the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean.\n\nTwo years after she talked with Jack in Barbados, Esmeralda and her crew attacked the Fair Wind, a brig of the East India Trading Company, in the waters east of Jamaica. When she boarded the Fair Wind, the merchant crew offered no resistance, but she was viciously attacked by the ship's captain, Nathaniel Bainbridge, who couldn't stand the idea of a woman commanding a ship, even a pirate vessel.\n\nTo her surprise, she also saw Jack Sparrow among the sailors, who begged her to spare the captain's life, though she could easily kill him. Esmeralda toyed with Bainbridge, easily evading his attacks, until one of Bainbridge's lucky thrusts cut off one expensive feather on her hat. Furious, Esmeralda made a small cut on Bainbridge's right hand, but the captain fell on deck as if he was stabbed in the heart. It was Sparrow who realized that Bainbridge had died from an apoplexy.\n\nImmediately after Bainbridge's death, Esmeralda and Jack parlayed about the fate of the Wind's crew and cargo. Esmeralda agreed to take only one third of the ship's cargo of rum, because her own crew loved alcohol too much. She also invited Jack to a dinner in her cabin on the Venganza. A few hours later, Esmeralda and Jack enjoyed the delicious meal, and after the dinner, they made love for almost an entire night. Before the dawn, Jack returned to the Fair Wind, with a warm goodbye to Esmeralda.\n\nA few months later, the Venganza was sailing through the Bahamas. Esmeralda, still wanting to avenge her grandfather's death, searched for Borya. She figured out that, if she captured him, she could force him to reveal anything he knew about Christophe's whereabouts. When the Venganza docked in Kemps Bay on Andros to sell the captured booty, Esmeralda contacted her informant Giles.\n\nGiles told her that he sold Borya the information about a certain Captain Jack Sparrow and his most probable route. He also told her that he spotted the Koldunya in the Northwest Providence Channel a few days ago. After hearing this news, Esmeralda sailed the Venganza north, searching for Borya's ship. She didn't find the Koldunya, but the Venganza captured a schooner bound for Charleston, loaded with fabric, and a flute loaded with tea and spices. She gave up the search and sailed south. She was sailing near Great Abaco when her crew spotted smoke on the horizon. Thinking that Borya had captured and burned another unfortunate ship, she ordered the crew to change the course, and they sailed toward the smoke. It wasn't until nightfall that the Venganza approached the spot where the smoke was sighted. But instead of the burning ship, the pirates found the damaged EITC merchant ship Wicked Wench, captained by Jack Sparrow himself.\n\nApparently, the Wicked Wench was attacked by the Koldunya, and during the battle, Borya's sloop was destroyed in the explosion. Esmeralda urged her crew to help Jack's sailors repair their ship, and the buccaneers agreed. A day after the battle, Esmeralda invited Jack and his First Mate Robert Greene to a dinner on the Venganza. During the dinner, Jack told her that the Koldunya was destroyed by the magical powers of his passenger, Ayisha, the princess of the previously unknown \"Kermalayan tribe\" from Africa. Esmeralda was intrigued by the story of the mysterious princess, and she decided to meet her. Jack also revealed that Ayisha isn't an old, ugly woman, but a beautiful woman who uses magic to hide her real appearance. Esmeralda told Jack to introduce them so she could invite her to a dinner. After the dinner, Esmeralda showed Jack and Robby her ship, of which she was very proud. She proposed to Jack to steal his ship from the EITC and join her as a pirate partner. However, he refused. Though she was a little dissapointed with Jack's decision, she was glad that she could spend more than a few hours with him. When they returned to the Wicked Wench, Esmeralda joined Jack in his cabin to spend the night with him.\n\nA day later, Jack introduced Ayisha to Esmeralda. That night, Ayisha came to the Venganza where she was welcomed by Esmeralda. Knowing that Ayisha was an expert seamstress, Esmeralda took her to the Venganza's cargo hold, where she gave her as much fabric as she wanted. Later, they dined in Esmeralda's cabin, and Ayisha took her magical shawl off, revealing her true appearance. During the dinner, they talked much about Jack Sparrow. Esmeralda told Ayisha how good a lover Jack is, but she then realized that Ayisha hasn't yet slept with a man. She then told her that she would make the right decision or, rather, the decision that was right for her, and that she'll know if\u2014or when\u2014was the right time to make the final step.\n\nA few hours later, they both returned to the Wicked Wench. The next day, Esmeralda and Jack practiced fencing for a while. After they finished, Esmeralda returned to her ship. The Venganza escorted the Wicked Wench for the next two days, until Esmeralda was sure that the temporary repairs on the Wench were holding. After that, Esmeralda sailed into new adventures. Her further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Esmeralda_Maria_Consuela_Anna_de_Sevilla"}}

During his painful mutation, his left eye migrated from its socket over to the left side of his extended hammerhead.

When Jones ordered his crew to summon the Kraken to destroy the Black Pearl, Maccus gave the command with an evil, leering smile. He was also an expert swordsman, as evidenced during the fight for the Dead Man's Chest on Isla Cruces. Here, Maccus battled the trio of Elizabeth Swann, Pintel and Ragetti, fighting them into a corner before they were rescued by Will Turner and James Norrington, who incidentally ran him over with the large wheel they where on, along with a few other members of the Dutchman crew.

He regularly observed the Sabbath and even had a chaplain on board to perform Sunday services. He nearly always returned the looted ship to her rightfull captain and never forced anyone to join his crew against his will. However, he could be as ruthless as any of his pirate peers.","Roberts owed his success to many factors, including his personal charisma and leadership, his daring and ruthlessness and his ability to co-ordinate small fleets to maximum effect. Wherever he was, commerce came to a halt, as fear of him and his men made merchants stay in port."],"name":"Bartholomew Roberts","description":"The son of George Roberts of Little Newcastle, Wales, John Roberts was born May 17, 1682. Going to sea at 13, Roberts appears to have worked in the merchant service until 1719. For some reason during this time Roberts changed his name from John to Bartholomew. In 1718, Roberts served as a mate of a sloop trading around Barbados. The following year he signed on as third mate of the London-owed slave ship Princess. Serving under Captain Abraham Plumb, Roberts traveled to Anomabu, Ghana in 1719. While off the coast of Africa, the Princess was captured by the pirate vessels Royal Rover and Royal James led by Howell Davis.\n\nComing aboard the Princess, Davis forced several of Plumb's men, including Roberts to join his crew. A reluctant recruit, Roberts soon found favor when Davis learned that he was a skilled navigator. A fellow Welshman, Davis frequently conversed with Roberts in Welsh which allowed them to speak without the rest of the crew comprehending their discussion. After several weeks of cruising, the Royal James had to be abandoned due to worm damage. Steering for Isle of Princes, Davis entered the harbor flying British colors. While repairing the ship, Davis began planning to capture the Portuguese governor.\n\nInviting the governor to dine aboard the Royal Rover, Davis was in turn asked to the fort for a drink prior to the meal. Having discovered Davis' true identity, the Portuguese planned an ambush. As Davis' boat neared, they opened fire killing the pirate captain. Fleeing the harbor, the crew of the Royal Rover was forced to elect a new captain. Though he had only been aboard for six weeks, Roberts was selected by the men to take command. Returning to the Isle of Princes after dark, Roberts and his men looted the town and killed the majority of the male population.\n\nThough he had initially been an unwilling pirate, Roberts took to his new role as captain feeling that it was \"Better being a commander than a common man.\" After capturing two ships, the Royal Rover put into Anamboe for provisions. While in port, Roberts had his crew vote on the destination of their next voyage. Selecting Brazil, they crossed the Atlantic Ocean and anchored at Ferdinando to refit the ship. With this work completed, they spent nine fruitless weeks searching for shipping. Shortly before abandoning the hunt and moving north to the West Indies, Roberts located a fleet of 42 Portuguese merchant ships.\n\nEntering Todos os Santos' Bay, Roberts captured one of the ships. Confronting its captain, he forced the man to point out the richest ship in the merchant fleet. The captain pointed to the Sagrada Familia, a 40-gun warship. Moving swiftly, Roberts' men swarmed aboard the Sagrada Familia and seized over 40,000 gold moidors as well as jewelry and other valuables. Departing the bay, they sailed north to Devil's Island to enjoy their loot. Several weeks later, Robert captured a sloop off the River Surinam. Shortly thereafter a brig was sighted. Eager for more plunder, Roberts and 40 men took the sloop to pursue it.\n\nWhile they were gone, Roberts' subordinate, Walter Kennedy, and the rest of the crew sailed away with the Rover, the Sagrada Familia, and the entire treasure taken off Brazil. Irate, Roberts' drew up new, strict articles to govern his crew and made the men swear to them on a Bible. Renaming the sloop Fortune they proceeded to attack shipping around Barbados. In response to his actions, the merchants on the island fitted out two ships to seek and capture the pirates. On February 26, 1720, they found and engaged Roberts and a pirate sloop captained by Montigny la Palisse. While Roberts turned to fight, la Palisse fled.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, the Fortune was badly damaged and 20 of Roberts' men were killed. Able to escape, he sailed for Dominica for repairs, evading pirate hunters from Martinique en route. Swearing vengeance on both islands, Roberts turned north and sailed to Newfoundland. After raiding the port of Ferryland, he entered the harbor of Trepassey and captured 22 ships. Commandeering a brig to replace his sloop, Roberts armed it with 16 guns and renamed it the Fortune. Departing in June 1720, he quickly captured ten French ships and took one of them for his fleet. Naming it the Good Fortune he armed it with 26 guns.\n\nReturning to the Caribbean, Roberts put into Carriacou to careen the Good Fortune. When this was completed he renamed the ship Royal Fortune and moved to attack St. Kitts. Entering Basse Terra Roads, he quickly captured all of the shipping in the harbor. After a brief stay on St. Bartholomew, Roberts' fleet began attacking shipping off St. Lucia and took 15 ships in three days. Among the prisoners was James Skyrme who became one of Roberts' captains. Through the spring of 1721, Roberts' and his men effectively stopped trade in the Windward Islands.\n\nAfter capturing and hanging the governor of Martinique in April 1721, Roberts set course for West Africa. On April 20, Thomas Anstis, the captain of the Good Fortune, left Roberts during the night and returned to the West Indies. Pressing on, Roberts arrived at the Cape Verde Islands where he was forced to abandon the Royal Fortune due to heavy leaking. Transferring to the sloop Sea King, he renamed the vessel Royal Fortune. Making landfall off Guinea in early June, Roberts quickly captured two French ships which he added to his fleet as Ranger and Little Ranger.\n\nOperating off Sierra Leone later that summer, Roberts captured the British Royal Navy frigate HMS Onslow. Taking possession, he made it his flagship with the name Royal Fortune. Following several months of successful plundering, Roberts attacked and occupied the port of Ouidah taking ten ships in the process. Moving to Cape Lopez, Roberts took time to careen and repair his ships. While there, the pirates were spotted by the HMS Swallow, commanded by Captain Chaloner Ogle. Believing the Swallow to be a merchant ship, Roberts sent James Skyrme and the Ranger in pursuit. Leading the pirate vessel out of sight of Cape Lopez, Ogle turned and opened fire. Quickly defeating Skyrme, Ogle turned and set course for Cape Lopez.\n\nSeeing the Swallow approach on February 10, Roberts believed it to be the Ranger returning from the hunt. Rallying his men, many of whom were drunk after capturing a ship the day before, Roberts sailed out in the Royal Fortune to meet Ogle. Roberts plan was to pass the Swallow and then fight in open water where escape would be easier. As the ships passed, the Swallow opened fire. The Royal Fortune's helmsman then erred allowing the British ship to unleash a second broadside. At that moment, Roberts was struck in the neck by grapeshot and killed. His crew threw his body overboard to avoid the corpse being captured.\n\nJack Sparrow later encountered Black Bart in Davy Jones' Locker, after the former was taken there by the Kraken. Black Bart had imprisoned the Pirate Lord of the Atlantic Ocean, Gentlemen Jocard, who Jack Sparrow wanted at the Conclave at Shipwreck Cove. The two subsequently fought, and Roberts was defeated by Sparrow. After being stabbed by Sparrow, Roberts gave a maniacal laugh and then, simply disappeared, leaving only his boots and sword behind.\n\nAs an interesting coda to Roberts' exploits, Jack Sparrow was known to have encountered Black Bart, along with Scarlett and Giselle, following the death of Lord Cutler Beckett, presumably during his search for the Fountain of Youth. Bart seemed less hostile to him than he had been whilst inside the Locker, and let him climb aboard his ship.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bartholomew_Roberts"}}

On several occasions, Gibbs served under Jack's nemesis and rival, Hector Barbossa, but was never truly loyal to him compared to his true loyalty to Jack. Gibbs had an endless capacity to forgive, necessary when he sailed with Jack Sparrow, but lived a pirate's life and followed the Pirate's Code.","Joshamee Gibbs was immediately recognizable from his ruddy complexion from life on deck, his portly build, and his distinctive \"muttonchops\" facial hair.

At some point in Jack Sparrow's teenage years, Jack and his father Edward Teague were captured by the Royal Navy. Gibbs, being friends with Teague, secretly helped them to escape their cells, being able to do this only because he was a sailor in the Royal Navy. However, he was very lenient to pirates as he wanted to keep the rum supply he was getting from them going.\n\nServing as a sailor of the Royal Navy, Gibbs was stationed aboard the HMS Dauntless some time later during its voyage from England to the Caribbean, carrying Weatherby Swann and his twelve year old daughter, Elizabeth, to Port Royal. Along the way, they encountered a wrecked vessel, and Gibbs voiced the opinion that it was the result of a pirate attack. Elizabeth became acquainted enough with Gibbs to recognize him on sight many years later. Ironically, while serving on the Dauntless, Gibbs was superstitious of pirates, even going as far to tell Elizabeth to stop singing a pirate song because it will supposedly invoke pirates upon them.\n\nGibbs remained with the Royal Navy for a while, though at some point over the next eight years, Gibbs turned to piracy once more. How he left the Navy is unknown, though it could have been either Gibbs deserted his post or that it was Jack Sparrow who persuaded Gibbs to turn pirate. By this point, Gibbs had known Jack well enough to be able to relate much of the man's life story and misadventures prior to his going after the treasure of the Isla de Muerta aboard the Black Pearl. He also became aware of the curse that afflicted those who removed the Aztec gold, and was aware of Sparrow's attempts to retake the Pearl following a mutiny led by Hector Barbossa.\n\nFollowing Barbossa's mutiny, Jack wound up on Port Royal, where he met a local beggar named Sightless Sam who offered to join Jack's crew as a boatswain. Little did Jack know that Gibbs, who had recently deserted the Royal Navy, was Sam's assistant. By this time, they began a close friendship. After Jack's exploits with the crew of the Mourning Star, he sailed back to Tortuga where he dismissed most of his crew, Gibbs included and together they spent a year or so on Tortuga before Jack commandeered the Jolly Mon.\n\nWhen Jack and Joshamee next met, Gibbs was down on his luck, and started sleeping with pigs outside the Faithful Bride in Tortuga. Accompanied by Will Turner, Jack joined Gibbs for a drink, where he agreed to help round up a crew after learning of Jack's plan to recapture the Black Pearl from Barbossa. The crew, with Gibbs as first mate, manned the commandeered navy vessel HMS Interceptor, and set out for Isla de Muerta. Upon arriving to the island, Will Turner asked how Jack Sparrow got his compass in the first place. Gibbs replied that no one knew much about Jack Sparrow before he searched for the dreaded Isla de Muerta, having said that was before he met Jack, back when he was captain of the Black Pearl. Gibbs then told Will of how he was mutinied by Barbossa and of Jack having escaped a desert island by roping a couple of sea turtles. Before Jack and Will left to the caves of Isla de Muerta, Gibbs asked Jack what if the worst should happen, to which Jack gave Gibbs the instruction: \"Keep to the Code.\"\n\nWhile at Isla de Muerta, Jack fell behind in his attempt to aid Will Turner in rescuing Elizabeth Swann, and Gibbs was forced to keep to the Code and depart without his captain. However, Barbossa caught up with and destroyed the Interceptor, holding Gibbs and the crew captive aboard the Pearl. While docked at Isla de Muerta during Barbossa's second attempt to lift his curse, Elizabeth freed the crew, who took control of the Pearl and immediately departed\u2014Jack having previously promised them a ship of their own.\n\nDespite Gibbs' apparent treachery, he and the rest of the crewmen had not given up on his former captain. Jack survived the battle at Isla de Muerta, but was sentenced to hang at Port Royal. Will Turner staged a rescue at the gallows, and the Black Pearl revealed itself, on the other side of the island, as Jack fell from the battlements of Fort Charles. Jack then swam to rejoin his crew. The Pearl set sail, under the command of Jack Sparrow once again, with Gibbs serving as first mate.\n\nThe pirate crew had numerous exploits over the next year, though their most dangerous came when Davy Jones unleashed the Kraken to settle a debt owed by Jack. Jack ordered Gibbs and the crew to set out for land to avoid the beast, and ended up on Pelegosto, where they were captured by the cannibalistic natives. Gibbs and his companions were held in bone cages while Jack was mistaken for a god they worshipped and made the chief, set to be roasted and eaten by the cannibals. With Will Turner's help, Gibbs and the crew managed to escape, and Jack rendezvoused with them at the Pearl.\n\nGibbs later joined Jack's quest to find the Dead Man's Chest, which took them to Tia Dalma's shack, a run-in with Davy Jones. Jack then had Gibbs sail the Pearl to Tortuga, where they had to gather 99 souls to pay off Jack's debt with Jones, which lead to a confrontation with James Norrington who joined his crew for the quest.\n\nAfter the journey to Isla Cruces, Gibbs participated in the fierce battle against the Kraken after Jack failed to obtain the chest. After the second battle to the seemingly unbeatable beast, Jack gave the order to abandon ship when the Pearl took damage, to which Gibbs agreed with. Unknown to him and the rest of the crew, Jack was tricked into remaining onboard by Elizabeth. Gibbs lamented the loss of both ship and captain, though set sail nevertheless.\n\nThere, at Tia Dalma's shack, as everyone was mourning the loss of the Pearl along with its captain, he raised a toast to his fallen captain. Gibbs was the first to answer Tia Dalma when she asked if any of the crewmen would be willing to sail to the ends of the Earth and beyond to bring Jack back from death. Gibbs and the crew met the resurrected Hector Barbossa, and made an uneasy alliance with him to sail a perilous journey to World's End, and from there into Davy Jones' Locker to rescue Jack.\n\nGibbs led the infiltration of Sao Feng's bath house in Singapore while Barbossa and Elizabeth confronted the Pirate Lord himself. Gibbs fought in the subsequent battle against Mercer's marines, and manned the Hai Peng as it set off for the Farthest Gate. During the voyage, Gibbs relayed his experience of the green flash to Will Turner, stating that he had seen his fair share of the phenomenon. He and the rest of the crew survived the fall from World's End into Davy Jones' Locker, where he was finally reunited with his old friend.\n\nJack, believing his friends to be another of the hallucinations experienced in the Locker, initially berated Gibbs for not keeping order aboard the Black Pearl, though ultimately relented and allowed Gibbs to join his crew aboard the Pearl as it set sail on the endless waters of the Locker. Gibbs was particularly unhappy to find all the rum gone during the voyage, and joined his captain in rocking the ship to escape the Locker. Back in the real world, Gibbs was involved in a tense stand-off with Jack, Barbossa, Will and Elizabeth, and covered Barbossa with his pistol while the former captain threatened Jack.\n\nThe stand-off was diffused, and the crew stopped off at a nearby island to gather fresh water. Gibbs remained aboard the Pearl, and apparently fought against Sao Feng's men as they stormed the ship as part of a deal made with Lord Cutler Beckett. Gibbs received a wound to his forehead during the struggle, and later joined in the attack against the HMS Endeavour when Feng agreed to a truce with Barbossa.\n\nThe crew set sail for Shipwreck Island, with which Gibbs was somewhat familiar, warning the crew of the dangerous passage into Shipwreck Cove. He was present during the fourth meeting of the Brethren Court, and was aware of the origins of the Pirate Lords' pieces of eight. He later crewed the Black Pearl alongside his companions during the battle around Calypso's maelstrom, which he ultimately survived, remaining aboard the ship throughout.\n\nWith the battle won, and Lord Beckett killed, the pirates were free to continue their freedom-loving ways. As they cheered, Jack Sparrow gave Gibbs permission to throw his hat, and Gibbs did so cheerfully. After the hat landed somewhere on the Pearl, Jack ordered Gibbs to go and get it. Gibbs returned to Tortuga with Jack, who intended to take Scarlett and Giselle for a ride on his ship. Gibbs took a nap at the docks, thus failing to stop Barbossa from commandeering the Black Pearl a second time. Jack berated Gibbs, but appeared content to sail without his precious ship, for now. He and Gibbs exchanged their customary farewell, and Jack set sail to find the Fountain of Youth. Gibbs headed into Tortuga with Scarlett and Giselle, while starting the discussion of sea turtles.\n\nFor the next few years after the War Against Piracy, Gibbs would try and be up on news listening for news of the whereabouts of the Black Pearl. But no such news came on the Pearl, not even where she docked or next make port. However, Gibbs would catch some news of Jack Sparrow's quest for the Fountain of Youth came through, including a rumor that Jack himself was in London recruiting a crew in a pub called the Captain's Daughter. At first, Gibbs found it odd, but then thought that Jack's never been the most predictable man he's met. And so Gibbs sailed to London to find his longtime comrade.\n\nAfter arriving in London, Gibbs started making inquiries as to the whereabouts of Jack, only to find himself arrested. Being mistaken for Jack Sparrow, Gibbs was to be brought on trial in the Old Bailey. Gibbs was forcibly taken by a Jailor into the courtroom, which was filled with an angry mob that wanted him hanged. A mysterious Judge Smith, actually Jack Sparrow himself in disguise, took over the case. Though Gibbs recognized him, he didn't want to give away his identity and get them both into more trouble. At the end of the trial, much to the surprise of Gibbs and the crowd, he condemned Gibbs to life in prison, rather than a hanging. Gibbs was then ordered to be transferred to the Tower of London under minimum security.\n\nJack joined Gibbs in a prison carriage, whose driver he bribed to transport them to shore. Gibbs informed Jack about the rumors of him recruiting a crew, which Jack renounced as completely false, and quite insulting. Seeing the Mao Kun Map in Jack's coat, Gibbs then asked Jack of his search for the Fountain of Youth, in which he responded that it was temporarily postponed and vowed that he would taste the waters of the Fountain.\n\nThe carriage then abruptly stopped, making Jack believe they've made their stop. But instead to the shore, the carriage brought Jack and Gibbs to the St. James's Palace, where they were surrounded by the British Royal Guards, who have also bribed the driver. Gibbs asked if this was part of the plan, and Jack simply told Gibbs \"No\", as he got hit by one of the guards. While Jack was forcibly taken into the palace to meet with King George II, Gibbs was put into prison as was planned.\n\nAfter Sparrow's escape from the palace, Hector Barbossa, who has managed to become a privateer and a trusted advisor of the King's Court, visited Gibbs in the execution courtyard inside the prison. He threatened to hang Gibbs if he doesn't he give him some useful information about Jack's whereabouts and plans. Gibbs suggested that he go with them, as he was a loyal crewmen, but Barbossa refused otherwise and commenced preparation of Gibbs' hanging. Worried about his life, Gibbs revealed to be in possession of the Mao Kun Map, which he secretly stole from Jack before they were captured. Though Barbossa asked for the map, Gibbs took a lantern and burned it before the eyes of Barbossa and his men. Fortunately, Gibbs stated that he had enough time to memorize the map, including every route to the Fountain of Youth, which forced Barbossa to recruit him as his navigator aboard the HMS Providence.\n\nAs the navigator aboard the Providence, Gibbs was at Barbossa's mercy. As the journey progressed, one of Barbossa's officers, Theodore Groves, brought Gibbs before Barbossa to provide a heading. Before Gibbs took a look at the ship's charts, he turned to Groves and asked for a gulper. Barbossa himself denied that request, saying that as privateers, they should behave as such. Gibbs begrudgingly agreed to that as he looked at the charts. After a few seconds with the map, Barbossa impatiently asked Gibbs if they were on the right course, in which Gibbs said he was sure they were. As proof, he pointed to three galleons of the Spaniard's fleet.\n\nRealizing the fleet was in command of the Spaniard, Barbossa immediately ordered the crew of the Providence to get into battle stations. But before they could fire their cannons, the fleet simply passed by the Providence without fire. Gibbs commented about the Spaniard not even turning his head. Barbossa deduced that their mission to find the Fountain was why the Spanish didn't attack, and that they weren't worth the time to attack. Gibbs watched as Barbossa ordered to make more sail, determined to reach their destination.\n\nAt some point in the voyage, the crew became wary of their destination. Barbossa revealed their immediate course, Whitecap Bay. Gibbs came in to ask if the stories of the bay were true and, after Barbossa ordered him to say it, asked if the journey to the bay could involve mermaids. Barbossa revealed that they were indeed sailing there. The crew then started to fear the worst, even leading one of its members to jump overboard. However, Barbossa managed to inspire confidence into the men by asking if they were King's men, and had the Providence set sail for Whitecap Bay.\n\nAs a storm erupted, Gibbs accompanied Barbossa's landing party into Whitecap Bay, consisting of a handful of men, including his officers, Groves and Gillette. After the crew landed ashore, Gibbs looked around, shocked by the chaos that littered the bay. While Barbossa's men found mermaid corpses, Gibbs warned Barbossa to give up the madness. Barbossa stated that he couldn't, saying that 'footsteps lie before him'. The Providence was then under attack by living mermaids. Barbossa ordered Gibbs to provide a heading, while Groves strongly urged Barbossa to help the crew aboard, but Barbossa denied the idea while pointing his pistol at Groves. As Barbossa ordered Gibbs for a heading, Gibbs and the rest of the crew watched the Providence fell to its attackers and sunk beneath the waves. Barbossa pointed his pistol at Gibbs, saying he'll have his head or his heading. Gibbs hesitates before moving on, leading the crew through their next heading through an island.\n\nWhile journeying through dark jungles, Gibbs and Barbossa complained about it being nice to have a map or a ship. Barbossa then saved Gibbs from a poisonous frog, which was about to touch his skin. A bewildered Gibbs stared as Barbossa added the frog to his jar-full of frogs. Sometime during Barbossa's travels to the Santiago by himself, he reunited with Jack Sparrow. Gibbs later met with Barbossa and Jack, who found the Spanish camp, where the Chalices of Cartagena were held. Gibbs and Jack had a brief reunion, where Jack flicked Gibbs for stealing his map.\n\nAs the crew journeyed to the Spanish camp, Jack and Gibbs discussed Jack's problem of rescuing Angelica, a damsel that he had feelings for long ago and left. Once the group was close to the camp, Barbossa ordered his men to stay back and wait for the signal. Both Jack and Barbossa managed to infiltrate the camp and stealthily steal the Chalices. However, after attempting to just walk out and fighting off some Spanish soldiers, the two are captured. After Jack and Barbossa successfully escaped from the Spanish, the crew went towards finding the Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth.\n\nIn the middle of the jungle, Jack presented the Chalices, tied onto a wild boar held on a leash by Gibbs, to Blackbeard and Angelica. But he wasn't willing to give them away without a few conditions. Jack's conditions included the return of Jack's compass and the freedom of Gibbs. Blackbeard considered it done as Gibbs released the boar. Gibbs offered to tag along with them as he handed the Chalices to Blackbeard, who gave him no mind. As the others left to find the Fountain of Youth, Jack tossed his compass to Gibbs, telling him it would lead him to freedom.\n\nWhile Barbossa and his crew followed Jack and Blackbeard to the Fountain, Gibbs used the compass to find Blackbeard's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge. There, he to retrieve the Black Pearl, which was put into a bottle. To get past Blackbeard's men who remained guarding the Revenge, Gibbs did a maneuver he and Jack perfected in New Guinea. With the help of Jack's compass, Gibbs was able to find the Pearl in a cabinet full of ships in a bottle and took them all and put them in a gunny sack. He was able to get away by the time Barbossa arrived to assume command as captain over the Queen Anne's Revenge.\n\nBeached on a sandy shore, Jack rejoins Joshamee Gibbs, who was lying on a piece of driftwood. Jack asked Gibbs about the profit in their cooperation, in which Gibbs revealed the Pearl in their possession, as well as all the other ships that Blackbeard had magically shrunk and bottled. Gibbs asked Jack if he had any idea to get her out, which Jack said that they needed a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats, and that one of them must play the trumpet while the other wiggles his fingers. Gibbs said that he knew someone with a goat, which made Jack immediately think he could be the one to wiggle his fingers.\n\nAs they walked on the beach during a sunset, Gibbs asked Jack why he didn't choose to use the Fountain of Youth, even though he had all the items, saying that he could've lived forever. Jack told Gibbs that the Fountain tests you, and that it's better to not know your last moment. He also said that he would live forever being named as the discoverer of the Fountain. Jack and Gibbs were both determined to continue a pirate's life.His further fate is unknown.\n\nAt some point in his life, presumably after his many adventures with Jack Sparrow, Gibbs authored a book called The Pirates' Code Guidelines: A Booke for Those Who Desire to Keep to the Code and Live a Pirate's Life. This tome included letters addressed to Gibbs from Jack, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, as well as Gibbs' own notes and drawings. The book was found many years later, perfectly preserved in the wreckage of the RMS Titanic.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Joshamee_Gibbs"}}

At some point in his life, Teague engaged in piracy, where he became an outlaw, but with an aristocratic bearing; a fearsome figure, but with unmistakable touches of sweetness and vulnerability; a feral pirate who can also break hearts with a lovely ballad from his guitar. A legendary pirate in his own right, Teague eventually commanded the awe and fearful respect of all Pirate Lords in the Brethren Court, and was once a very feared pirate in the world; said to have done many things. In the Age of Piracy, Teague was Pirate Lord of Madagascar and Keeper of the Code.\n\nAt some point in the early 18th century, Teague and an  unknown female had a son, Jack Sparrow. Throughout his son's childhood, Teague was always there when his boy needed him most, such as knocking out the pirate Rusty Knickers when he threatened to cut off Jack's hand or saving Jack from being sold into slavery by Captain Lucille Graven. In later years, Teague occasionally re-appeared in his son's life, who would follow in his buccaneering footsteps.\n\nAfter Jack escaped from Shipwreck Cove, Teague went to search for him on his old ship, the Misty Lady. During the search, he even visited the notorious voodoo priestess Tia Dalma, though he didn't find Jack in her shack. However, he was able to find him a few months later in a boat called the Barnacle in the middle of the Caribbean Sea, accompanied by another youngster, the English nobleman Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III. Jack and Fitzwilliam were brought onboard the Lady, but the ship was suddenly attacked by the British Royal Navy fleet led by Admiral Lawrence Norrington.\n\nThe pirates were all captured and brought onboard Lawrence Norrington's ship. Thanks to Teague's old friend Joshamee Gibbs, pirates managed to escape from the brig, and a huge battle ensued on deck. During the battle, Teague used his magical ring to force Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III to help them. In the midst of a battle, Norrington's son James was knocked into the sea and rescued by Teague. After a massive cannon fight between the Lady and Norrington's vessel, Teague's crew managed to batter Norrington's ship, rendering it defenseless. With Norrington's crew defeated, Teague and Jack made their way back to the Misty Lady, and Teague sailed his son to an extremely beautiful island near Poseidon's Peak so he could procure himself a new boat.\n\nTeague returned to Shipwreck Cove, where he was soon rejoined by his son Jack. At some point, Jack joined a crew on a pirate ship called the Wicked Wench and started traveling with them. Some time later, a new, very powerful, enemy appeared. A captain coming from the Spanish Royal Navy called Armando Salazar who despised pirates with a passion and made his goal in life to get rid of every single one of them, killing thousands of people on his path. A group of pirates decided to join and make a final attack against him. Teague joined the Wicked Wench's crew on this attack presumably to look out for Sparrow who also remained on the crew to fight. During the battle, all ships were destroyed except the Wench. Many pirates died, including Morgan, the Wench's captain who trusted Jack with his compass before dying. Teague, seeing this as an act of inheritance not only of the compass but the ship itself, put himself at orders of Sparrow who quickly worked towards a plan to defeat the Silent Mary. Teague worked hard with the rest of the crew in order to execute Jack's plan which succeded in fooling Salazar, dooming him to the Devil's Triangle. With Salazar gone, Jack was offered tribute. Teague looked from behind his son as he was crowned with his new belongings. A smile on his face could be seen.\n\nTwo years later, the mysterious rogue pirates begun to violate the Code of the Pirate Brethren by slaughtering the crews of the merchant ships they captured. Teague's responsibility as the Keeper of the Code was to investigate the case. Six months later, a meeting of the Pirate Lords was held in Great Chamber. Among the gathered pirates were Don Rafael, Dona Esmeralda, Boris Palachnik, Mistress Ching, Eduardo Villanueva, and Jack Sparrow. The pirate captains at the meeting expressed their dismay over the rogue attacks on peaceful merchant ships, for the fear of war on piracy being declared by the colonial powers of Europe. Another pirate captain at the meeting, Hector Barbossa, witnessed that his pirate ship, the Cobra was destroyed by the rogues, which gave the Brethren another reason to destroy the rogues.\n\nAt that time, Jack begun to date Esmeralda, the granddaughter of Don Rafael, the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea, but Teague warned Jack to stay away from her. But Jack's friendship with Esmeralda continued, and they discovered the ship that destroyed the Cobra docked in Shipwreck Cove. It was the Koldunya, the sloop of Boris \"Borya\" Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea.\n\nAfter Teague and Don Rafael heard the news, Teague called for an official court of inquiry. In the Great Chamber, all the witnesses told their stories, but there was not enough evidences against Borya, and Teague decided to summon Davy Jones, the Lord of the sea. Jones knew everything that happened in his watery kingdoms, and the Brethren Court spoke a magic call that brought Jones onboard the Troubadour, Teague's ship. When asked about Borya's guilt, Jones recognized him as the leader of the rogue pirates, saying that he and his men sent many souls to the sea bottom without mercy.\n\nBorya and his whole crew were quickly imprisoned in the dungeons of Shipwreck City and sentenced to death by Teague. For unknown reasons, Borya gave his jailers the names of all rogue captains under his command. Thanks to those informations, the French pirate captain Christophe-Julien de Rapièr and his crew were captured while they were trying to flee from the island. They were also sentenced to death. Christophe's friend Jack Sparrow believed him to be innocent.\n\nTeague began to make plans on taking a fleet to find and destroy the rest of the rogues on their meeting place. But a night before Borya's hanging, Jack Sparrow broke into the dungeons and freed Christophe and his crew. But Christophe's guilt was proved a moment later, when he freed Borya and his crew too. The rogues stormed the armory, and the huge battle begun at the docks. One of the rogues aimed his musket at Teague, but Jack knocked the barrel of the musket aside, causing the rogue pirate to miss his target. In the chaos of the battle, the rogues managed to escape to their ships, taking Jack with them.\n\nJack's escape with the rogues made him an outlaw in the eyes of the Brethren for the next five years. Though Jack managed to escape from Christophe's ship, he didn't return to Shipwreck Cove, for fear that Teague would want to hang him. Five years later, Jack was a captain of the EITC merchant vessel Wicked Wench. During his adventures, he killed Borya, and was reunited with Esmeralda who told him that he can redeem himself in Teague's eyes by dispatching the rogues he freed. A few months later, Jack killed Christophe, and after he returned to piracy, he sailed his ship to Shipwreck Island.\n\nAfter Jack's redemption, Teague abandoned his position of Pirate Lord, giving his seat to his son, who became the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea. Soon, Teague relocated with his whole family (except Jack) to Libertalia. One day, Jack's ship, the Black Pearl, arrived to Libertalia, and Teague took Jack and his friends to his mansion. During the dinner, they were attacked by pirates led by Gentleman Jocard, who thought that they were hosting King Samuel, Jocard's former owner who sold him into slavery. Jocard's and Jack's crews combined their forces, and they stormed Samuel's fort, obtaining the vial of Shadow Gold. They returned to Libertalia, and departed for Europe. Before Jack departed, Teague then gave him some advises on the choices he'll make in his life.\n\nSome time after Jack's departure, Teague returned to Shipwreck Cove, where he reclaimed his position as the Keeper of the Code. However, the Pirata Codex book was stolen by the Indian Akshay, and Teague had to follow him and retake the book before Askhay could sell it to the East India Trading Company. Teague sailed for the Indian Ocean, and followed Askhay to his hideout, the island of Velha Goa, but he was captured by Askhay's warriors, who threw Teague into the dark, nearly bottomless pit full of skeletons of previous captives.\n\nSome time later, Teague's son Jack Sparrow was also thrown into the pit, because he tried to steal the precious tears of the Indian goddess Kali from Askhay. Jack managed to find the secret passage and they both returned to Akshay's palace where they attacked and overpowered three guards and stole their weapons.\n\nTague started searching for the Pirata Codex book, but Jack went to the harbor to escape from the island. Though Teague managed to find and take the book, he was quickly surrounded by Akshay and his warriors. However, Jack changed his mind and returnd to help Teague. Teague then fired his pistol at one candle, knocking it on the floor and starting a fire in the palace, which Jack and Teague used to escape together. Some time later, on the coast of Madagascar, Teague secretly stole the tears of Kali from Jack, boarded Jack's boat and sailed away, leaving Jack stranded and proclaiming himself as the greatest pirate in the world. Following this adventure, Teague returned with the Pirata Codex book to Shipwreck Island.\n\nShortly before attack on Port Royal, a pirate named Mungard resided in Shipwreck City as Teague's stooge. Having taken the Pirate's Code almost as seriously as Teague did, Mungard made himself a self-appointed guardian of the Code. However, Teague would be kept in the dark of Mungard's heinous act of having shot the Code during an auction led by the Auctioneer. Teague would soon continue enforcing the Code's laws by himself.\n\nSome time after the battle of the Isla de Muerta, Teague hired the pirate Bronze John to transport him to Driftwood Island, a place where he burried a stash of rum some time earlier. Unfortunately for Teague, the members of the British Royal Navy were on the island at the same time, and Teague was capured after a short fight. Teague was taken aboard the Navy ship, which sailed for the closest British colony to hand him over to the authorities. Fortunately for Teague, one pirate captain attacked and sunk the Navy ship, thus saving him from an appointment with the gallows.\n\nAlmost a year later, through unknown circumstances, Teague would again reunite with his son during Jack's search for the Dead Man's Chest, in which Jack entered the Turkish Prison to procure a piece of cloth with a drawing of the key to the Dead Man's Chest. While in the prison's dungeons, Teague inspired Jack to escape the prison before his captors could hang him. Knowing that his son was safe, for the time being, Teague returned to Shipwreck Cove where he would continue his duties as Keeper of the Code.\n\nDuring the meeting of the Fourth Brethren Court, presided over by Hector Barbossa and Jack Sparrow, Captain Teague was called upon by Barbossa to cite from the Pirata Codex after Jack was able to persuaded the Pirate Lords to an act of war, much to Jack's dismay. Teague entered the meeting while standing in a doorway, gunsling smoke rising from his pistol after having shot Sri Sumbhajee's aide Askay for demeaning the Code's importance, saying: \"Code is the law.\" Teague intimidated those in the chamber with fear, particularly his son Jack. After the carriers brought the Pirata Codex to the Court, Teague whistled for the Prison Dog, who had the keys to unlock the padlocked book. After he citing a section from the Code, the Pirate Lords decided to vote for the new Pirate King. While the Lords were voting, Teague sat down and played \"Only Found Out Yesterday\" on his guitar. The Pirate Lords then began to argue after Elizabeth Swann was voted as the new King, but stopped after Jack questioned them about not keeping to the Code, in which Teague broke one of his guitar strings and gave the Lords a fierce glare.\n\nAfter the meeting, Teague offered Jack advice concerning the latter's search for immortality as well as reuniting Jack with his mother\u2014whose shrunken head Teague carried around with him. Giving the head to his son, Jack would later hang the head on his own belt. The Brethren then exited the chamber anxiously, but were confronted by soldiers of the East India Trading Company, led by Black Coats who had infiltrated the city. Teague was trapped on the South Docks, and he was able to defeat his enemies with the assistance of his son.\n\nThe next day, Teague climbed aboard his ship, the Troubadour, where he and his crew joined with the other ships in the Brethren's fleet. Teague's crew would witness the battle around Calypso's maelstrom, which saw the deaths of Davy Jones and Lord Cutler Beckett. Upon seeing the other ships of the EITC Armada retreating, Teague's crew celebrated with the other pirates. Instead of cheering and dancing, which many others did, Teague merely took his hat and tossed it into the air and smiled over the Brethren's victory.\n\nSeveral years later, Teague would cross paths with Jack Sparrow once again; this time in London, after his son escaped from King George's palace. After Jack was confronted by a soldier of the King's Royal Guard, Teague shot the soldier in the back, saving Jack once again. Teague and Jack continued their brief reunion inside the Captain's Daughter tavern. While talking in the tavern, they discussed about Jack's new trinket which had one of Jack's own teeth on it. Teague then went to the matter at hand: Jack's search for the Fountain of Youth. He gave Jack information about the Profane Ritual, as well as one of the items needed for it, two silver Chalices from Ponce de León's ship. As Jack became interested in finding the items, Teague advised his son against the search until he knew every detail.\n\nHaving pointed Jack to the group who were recruiting a crew, Teague gave Jack a word of advice, warning him that the Fountain would \"test\" him. Teague and Jack then drank their drinks before Jack glanced towards the group. When Jack looked back, Teague had already gone. His further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Edward_Teague"}}

Half woman, half fish, these lethally-minded sisters of the sea rise up from the waves to lure men into their arms. Beautiful, conniving and dangerous, mermaids would do anything to protect their homes."],"name":"Mermaid","description":"Sailors have speculated for centuries about these magical creatures. Half woman, half fish, they rise up from the waves to lure men into their arms. As creatures of legend and lore, mermaids, while beautiful, were also feared creatures, being referred to as \"sea ghouls, devilfish\" and known for their dreadful hunger for flesh of man.\n\nMermaids were also associated with legends regarding the Fountain of Youth, which was said to be discovered by Ponce de León in 1523. Those seeking the Fountain, who had knowledge of the Profane Ritual, had to find and capture a mermaid at Whitecap Bay. Only a mermaid's tear, placed in one of the Chalices of Cartagena, would set the rejuvenating forces of the Fountain to work. On many journeys to the Fountain, the Jungle Pools have been used to harvest mermaid tears. Tying mermaids within reach of water, yet leaving their bodies to slowly dry out. When the creatures die, they leave behind the remains of their marine form. Some time after Ponce de León's discovery, a mermaid would be drawn onto the Mao Kun Map, one of the few guides to the Fountain of Youth.\n\nCaptain Jack Sparrow first encountered the mermaids in Isla Sirena, following the escape from Isla Esquelética, during his quest for the Sword of Cortés. His shipmates, the crew of the Barnacle, were affected by the song of the Sirens, though Jack himself remained immune to its influence. Unable to sway him, the mermaids instead transported Jack to Isla Sirena itself, where they attempted to enslave him by robbing him of his freedom. Jack was tricked into handing over a prized possession\u2014the eye of Stone-Eyed Sam\u2014in exchange for the lives of his crew. Further, his freedom would be forfeit the next time he visited Isla Sirena.\n\nDespite realizing this stipulation, Jack was forced to return to the mermaids' lair in order to recover the eye to defeat the spirit of Hernán Cortés. He negotiated his enslavement with the blue-tailed mermaid leaders, and defeated two predatory beasts in order to avoid eternal imprisonment. He was allowed to leave the island, and later reclaimed the eye from Tia Dalma.\n\nDuring the 1740s, the undead pirate captain Jolly Roger planned to take over the entire Caribbean and make himself a Pirate Lord. As he intended to unleash his terrible curse on the islands of the Caribbean, the mermaids somehow learned about his dreadful plan and warned the buccaneers about his evil intentions. Thanks to this warning, Jolly's plan wasn't successful.\n\nDuring the War against Piracy, the Mermaids were attacked and killed by pirate alliances because of their bodies resources were obtained for multiple things, many monsters were attacked for the same reasons as the Cursed Wanderer, Ancient Octopus, Banshee, Spectral Sawfish, Mutated Whale, Giant Lobster and the Sea serpent.\n\nDuring the quest for the Fountain of Youth, Blackbeard and his crew journeyed to Whitecap Bay to capture a mermaid for the Profane Ritual. Blackbeard used his crew as living bait, as well as using man-made light from the lighthouse to lure the mermaids. Scrum was forced to sing My Jolly Sailor Bold to attract the mermaids, and successfully attracted the attention of Tamara. As Tamara continued singing Scrum's song, other mermaids appeared to the longboat. Their beauty fascinated the sailors, but Tamara revealed her true form. The mermaids began a lethal attack on Blackbeard's crewmen. Jack Sparrow managed to set an explosion on the lighthouse to scare them away, even meeting an old flame, Marina, in the process. A young mermaid later named Syrena, who proved to be very different from her vicious kind, was left behind to be captured by Blackbeard's men. The day after, the mermaids returned to attack the HMS Providence, dragging it and the crew onboard to the depths.\n\nThe mermaids were amphibious beings, a hybrid of human and fish. The average mermaid had the appearance of a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair, and skin flecked with scales. From the waist down, however, a mermaid was comprised of a long, shimmering scaly fish-like tail. Further undermining their conventional beauty, mermaids hid sharp, fang-like teeth in their mouths.\n\nThe true form of mermaids however was very different to their beautiful guise; The mermaids of Isla Sirena had hair the colour of the sea and pearly skin covered in scales but if viewed peripherally, they lost their outward beauty and seemed to transform into creatures with clawed tentacles, fangs, and barnacles and boils covering their scales. They often spoke in harmony, singing a melody commonly attributed to the Sirens. However the mermaids of Whitecap Bay appeared as very beautiful human women of different nationalities above the water, but once under water their skin became covered in scales, fangs grew in their mouths and their eyes changed to unnatural colours and would appear at times to glow fiercely.\n\nMermaids were incredibly beautiful and incredibly seductive and they lured seamen to their deaths. Their greatest weapon was their radiant appearance. The light of the moon illuminated their skin, their long locks fell seductively, and their deep-as-the-ocean eyes possessed the power to entrap any adventurer.\n\nMermaids possessed superhuman strength and were strong enough to break through solid wood with their bare hands. In large numbers, they have even been known to topple great ships: they were able to pull a fully crewed and masted frigate, the HMS Providence, underwater with very little effort. The mermaids of Whitecap Bay were known to have fed on men, seeing them as something that sustained them. They may look lovely, but they can shred a human limb from limb in seconds. These mermaids have been known to use long strands of seaweed as a form of lasso to pull sailors off ships or cliffs out of reach.\n\nTheir long and powerful tails made them very fast swimmers, adapt at hunting prey, and gave the mermaids the capability of leaping out of the water to take any unfortunate sailor in midair off of the decks of boats, before diving back in. Their tails were covered in a scaly translucent membrane which floats around them like tendrils in the water and was shed when they gained legs. They can survive long enough on land to drag a sailor back into the sea, where they can entangle them in a powerful grip. The mermaids of Whitecap Bay also have the ability to go on land in human form, beneath the skin of their tails was the suggestion of the legs they gain on land. However if they were partially in the water, trapped in mermaid form but not enough in the water to live, they can dry out and die. They also appeared to have red blood as shown when Philip Swift stabbed Syrena's fin.\n\nMermaids were known to have special abilities. It was common knowledge that a kiss from a mermaid would protect a sailor from drowning. In legends concerning the Fountain of Youth, particularly the Profane Ritual, a mermaid's tear was one of the required items needed in order to make the Fountain work. But as proud and ferocious as the seas in which they live, mermaids do not weep lightly. It was said that tears of joy were the more potent.\n\nMermaids also appeared to have some degree of psychic ability. Syrena seemed to show these abilities when she saved Philip Swift because she sensed he was \"different\" and that he \"protects\" compared to other men she and her kind encounter. Syrena also appeared to have sensed that the Chalices of Cartagena had fallen into the waters of the Fountain, and that Angelica needed saving as she told Jack Sparrow to not waste her tear.\n\nStories and legends of mermaids commonly depicted sweet and innocent creatures, though more sinister versions told of corrupted merfolk who aligned themselves with the Sirens. In reality, there were thousands of the latter type in Isla Sirena alone, and this legion was known to congregate to drag sailors down to the depths, a trait also shared with the mermaids of Whitecap Bay.\n\nThe mermaids of Isla Sirena were part of the merfolk that did the bidding of the Sirens, who were in turn ruled by Davy Jones. They resided in chambers within Isla Sirena, and had control over various creatures that inhabited Davy Jones' Locker, including iguana monsters and sea beasts. The merfolk also had contact with Tia Dalma, and were aware of legendary artifacts such as the Sword of Cortés.\n\nThere were at least three separate sub-species of merfolk in Isla Sirena, distinguished by the color of the scales on their fish-like tails. Those with green tails were analogous to soldiers, and operated as the military arm of the society. They confronted sailors lured to Isla Sirena and dragged them down to the island itself. Red-tailed merfolk were the servants of mermaid society, and were commonly found wading around waiting for orders. They acted as guards and workers in Isla Sirena. Finally, blue-tails served as the leaders of the mermaids. The three blue-tails encountered by Jack Sparrow, Morveren, Aquala and Aquila, were named as \"chairwomen\" by the green-tails.\n\nDoom awaits any misguided mariner who sought out the perilous waters of Whitecap Bay. Myths tell of mermaids lurking beneath the pale, foaming breakers, but few knew that these briny beauties were actually flesh-eating creatures. When Blackbeard located these denizens of the deep, he and his crew found themselves surrounded by vengeful foes. Legend had it that man-made light and song attracted the sirens of the sea, so the longboat full of Blackbeard's crewmen\u2014sent as the bait\u2014is lit by the beam of the lighthouse and Scrum sings a swaying sea shanty.\n\nThe mermaids in Whitecap Bay seemed to be more independent from Sirens, and they also appeared to be far more aggressive and bloodthirsty. Beautiful, conniving and dangerous, these mermaids would do anything to protect their home in Whitecap Bay. Drawn to the surface by a man-made light and singing sailors, they entrance their prey into coming close before dragging them to the depths of the Bay to devour them. However, if the men caught on, which would presumably be right after the first one was taken, the mermaids would abandon their gentle disguise, and attack viciously, acting in a similar manner to sharks in a feeding frenzy. They were apparently very driven to catch their prey, so much that they clawed and punched through wood in attempts to snare their targets. The mermaids appeared to be very territorial, which was noted during the battle with Blackbeard's crew, as well as the sinking of the HMS Providence shortly after its arrival to the Bay.\n\nThe attraction to man-made light and song was often used as a way to capture mermaids. However, they were naturally afraid of fire, though this could be interpreted as a fear of any forms of general warmth, which can cause them to dry out. This can be noted by mermaids fleeing Blackbeard's Greek fire as well as legends of the Jungle Pools.\n\nA mermaid's bond with her sisters was hard to tell, but appears to be rather cold, as when Syrena was captured, the other mermaids retreated without any visible concern. Also, when Syrena was forced to look at the many mermaid corpses, and Blackbeard's taunting of the death of her fellow mermaids, she didn't seem to be particularly affected. However, she did apparently show a slight trace of emotion, perhaps anger at the men for their actions. Mermaids have been described by Blackbeard as being tough, and strong willed, making it rare for them to genuinely shed tears. Their tears of joy were said to be the most potent type of tear. The mermaid people believed that \"the One pours death into life, and life into death, without a drop spilt.\"\n\nHowever, not all mermaids were vicious. Some were capable of having a compassionate and loving side, most notably from Syrena. Syrena appeared to be unique among her kind as she was the only known mermaid to actually develop feelings for a human. Though it wasn't the same case with Marina, who had a relationship with Jack Sparrow at some point in her life.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mermaid"}}

After losing the wooden eye, Ragetti replaced it with an eyepatch."],"name":"Ragetti","description":"Ragetti and Pintel were both press-ganged into service by the British Royal Navy, but they did not take well to this life. After a year of beatings, bad food and boredom, both jumped ship and set themselves up as pirates in the Caribbean.\n\nBoth Ragetti and Pintel joined the pirate crew of the Cobra, a small pirate schooner captained by Hector Barbossa. They served under Barbossa faithfully, participating in many pirate raids and battles at sea. At some point in his early pirate career, Ragetti lost his right eye in battle, and he covered his empty eye socket with an eyepatch. As a compensation for his lost eye, Ragetti received 300 pieces of eight.\n\nAt the end of the 1720s, the Cobra was attacked by another pirate ship, which was the clear violation of the Code of the Pirate Brethren. The Cobra sank to the bottom of the ocean, and Pintel and Ragetti saved their captain, who almost drowned in a futile attempt to save his pet monkey, Polly. A few days later, Ragetti and the surviving crewmebers found a deserted island, from which they were picked by the passing pirate ship. Ragetti and his mates were taken to Tortuga, where they encountered Don Rafael, the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. After hearing Barbossa's story, Don Rafael took them all on his ship, the Venganza, and transported them to Shipwreck Island, where Barbossa repeated his story to the assembled Pirate Lords.\n\nDuring the next few months, Barbossa and his men stayed on the island. During that time, Ragetti was a regular visitor in the Drunken Lady tavern. When the young pirate Jack Sparrow accused Boris \"Borya\" Palachnik, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea, of being one of the rogue pirates that sank the Cobra, Ragetti was called as a witness at the Pirate Hall.\n\nWith the help of Davy Jones, the lord of the underwater realms, the Pirate Lords proved Borya's guilt. Borya and his whole crew were sentenced to hang. A few days later, Barbossa gave Ragetti a wooden eye, Borya's piece of eight, the sign of Pirate Lordship, for safekeeping. Ragetti used it to replace his lost eye.\n\nThrough unknown circumstances, both Ragetti and Pintel lost contact with their captain. Barbossa's Piece of Eight remained in Ragetti's possesion. Seven years after the destruction of the Cobra, both Ragetti and Pintel were at Tortuga, the same night Captain Jack Sparrow arrived there with the Black Pearl, looking for a crew to sail to Isla de Muerta and claim the lost treasure of Hernán Cortés. Ragetti and Pintel both joined Sparrow's crew, along with other pirates. On the Black Pearl, they were reunited with Barbossa, who at that time served as the First Mate on the Pearl.\n\nThree days into the voyage, Ragetti joined in a mutiny staged by Barbossa that left Jack marooned on Rumrunner's Isle, while the crew of the Black Pearl completed its journey. At Isla de Muerta, the treasure was found, and soon frittered away. It was only after having lost all 882 gold coins that the pirates came to believe the legend of the treasure's terrible curse: as punishment for their transgression, they had become undead, becoming skeletal-like beings in moonlight, but always unable to feel or taste anything. Only by returning all 882 pieces into the stone chest on Isla de Muerta, and giving the chest blood for every coin a pirate took, would the curse be lifted. Ragetti was forced to remain with the crew until such a time as the curse was lifted. When that time came, Ragetti wished to buy a glass replacement for his wooden eye, perhaps indicating he would forsake his vow to keep safe Barbossa's piece of eight.\n\nFor the next ten years, the crew of the Black Pearl raided settlements across the Seven Seas, tracking down all the pieces of treasure taken from the chest, with an odd ability to sense when a coin was near. If a coin hit water, a beacon would be sent out, and the pirates would be drawn to the spot. In the tenth year, Ragetti and Pintel joined the attack on Port Royal that would secure them the final piece.\n\nThe Black Pearl slipped quietly into the bay and opened fire on the city's fortress, Fort Charles. Ragetti and Pintel went ashore in one of the Pearl's boats and lead the attack on the Governor's mansion. The pirates swarmed into the house, and Ragetti spotted Elizabeth Swann, the girl who possessed the coin. Ragetti and Pintel raced up the staircase and broke down the girl's bedroom door and tried to grab her, but she simply hit Pintel in the head with a bed warmer, and released the hot coals on Ragetti's head. The pursuit continued back down the stairs and into the dining room. Ragetti wanted to head out the open window, but Pintel knew she was still inside the room. They found her in a closet and were about to harm her when she invoked the right of parley, demanding to be taken before their captain. Though Ragetti was not happy with this, Pintel knew this would greatly help their mission, and did as requested.\n\nOnboard the Black Pearl, Elizabeth told the crew that she was Elizabeth Turner, leading the crew to believe she was the daughter of \"Bootstrap Bill\", and thus her blood would help lift the curse. During the voyage back to Isla de Muerta, Pintel and Ragetti were ordered to present Elizabeth with a dress and Barbossa's request for her to dine with him. When given the choice between a clothed dinner with Barbossa, and a dinner nude amongst the crew, she quickly accepted Barbossa's proposal, much to Pintel and Ragetti's disappointment. While Elizabeth was getting dressed, the pirates spied on her through a small hole in the wall, but Elizabeth noticed and poked out Ragetti's wooden eye.\n\nAt Isla de Muerta, it was revealed that Elizabeth was not of the Turner bloodline, and Bo'sun blamed the mistake on Ragetti and his partner. They defended themselves, and set out with the rest of the crew to track down the escaping Elizabeth. On the way, Ragetti spotted Jack Sparrow, believed to be dead. Sparrow informed Barbossa's crew whose blood they really needed, and the pirates set off in pursuit of the HMS Interceptor. The Pearl swiftly caught up with the Interceptor, which clubhauled to deliver a full broadside attack on the Pearl. Ragetti and Pintel manned a cannon during the battle, firing a chain shot that brought down the Interceptor's main mast.\n\nThe battle was soon over, the medallion recaptured by Jack the monkey, and the surviving members of the Interceptor's crew were taken prisoner, including William Turner, whom Pintel and Ragetti escorted to the treasure cave at the island. Before the sacrifice could be completed, however, Jack Sparrow arrived once again, much to the amazement and disbelief of the crew. He told them that the Dauntless was waiting offshore to ambush the pirates. Ragetti and Pintel were chosen to distract the marines while the rest of the crew infiltrated the ship; a ruse that Ragetti likened to the siege of Troy. Their cover was blown, however, when Ragetti commented on Pintel's look while wearing the dress that comprised their disguise. Pintel attempted to choke Ragetti, leaping out from under his umbrella and revealing their skeletal forms to the marines. By then, however, the cursed pirates had already sprung their assault, which Ragetti and Pintel soon joined.\n\nPintel and Ragetti rowed over to the Dauntless and climbed through a port hole. When the soldiers in the boats realized their ship was under attack, they rowed back toward the ship. Pintel and Ragetti manned one of the Dauntless' cannons and began to fire at the boats. Once the soldiers made it to the ship however, things began to go badly for the pirates. With the combined efforts of Will Turner and Jack Sparrow, the curse was lifted at the most inopportune moment. The Pearl was commandeered by the crew of the Interceptor, Barbossa was killed by Sparrow, and the pirates onboard the Dauntless became flesh again. Ragetti had lost his eye during the battle, and as soon as he put it back into his head, he and Pintel were surrounded by Norrington's soldiers and placed under arrest along with the rest of the crew of the Pearl.\n\nPintel and Ragetti were taken back to Port Royal and tried for their crimes. They were able to escape, however, after Pintel coerced the Prison Dog into helping them. They acquired a longboat and set out to find the Black Pearl once more.\n\nBy this time, Ragetti had begun to come to terms with his newly-regained mortality. He apparently found religion, and attempted to read the Bible, despite being illiterate. Nevertheless, he felt it was the effort that counted, and strove to protect his immortal soul as much as possible.\n\nRagetti and Pintel ultimately happened upon the Black Pearl around a year after their arrest, lying moored on the coast of Isla de Pelegosto. They set about readying the ship for departure, hoping to commandeer it for themselves. However, its current crew soon returned after escaping from a tribe of Pelegostos warriors, and set sail with the would-be thieves. Captain Sparrow, who had taken control of the vessel soon after the Isla de Muerta incident, did not appear to mind their presence aboard, and accepted them as members of the crew\u2014though privately considered them, later along with James Norrington, as his most expendable crewmen.\n\nThey accompanied Jack Sparrow to a meeting with Tia Dalma in her shack, where Ragetti became transfixed by dozens of staring eyeballs in an iron-bound jar hanging from a rafter. The grisly sight would have been sickening for some, though Ragetti found the eyes beautiful to behold, and hoped that his chance of replacing his wooden eye was closer than ever. He also expressed his opinion that the dichotomy of good and evil was something that vexed all men, perhaps offering an insight into his mindset following the incident at Isla de Muerta.\n\nRagetti and Pintel journeyed with Sparrow to a uninhabited shoal, where they were confronted by Davy Jones and the crew of the Flying Dutchman. Sparrow was able to make a deal with Jones: to deliver one hundred souls to him in return for the saftey of his own. The crew was saved, but their peril was far from over. The Pearl sailed to Tortuga, where Pintel and Ragetti gathered supplies for the ship, while their new captain gathered fresh crewmen to deliver to Jones. Elizabeth Swann joined the crew, and was rather surprised to see her two old antagonists aboard the Pearl again.\n\nFrom Tortuga, the crew set out to find the Dead Man's Chest, finally locating it on Isla Cruces. Sparrow told them to mind the boat when they came ashore, and while Pintel complained, Ragetti mused on joining the circus, balancing a shovel on his hand. Upon seeing the sinking image of the Flying Dutchman, Pintel and Ragetti abandoned the boat and ran in fear to rejoin their comrades. By this point, Ragetti had accumulated a great deal of knowledge pertaining to the wants and desires of his colleagues, and was able to accurately explain the motivations of Sparrow, Turner and Norrington to Pintel, during the trio's fight for the chest. He and Pintel decided that the chest was too great a temptation for the three, and so they stole the chest and ran off into the jungle, followed closely by Elizabeth, who eventually caught up to and confronted them. They were forced to fight a common enemy when Davy Jones' crewmen attacked, and the three improvised a surprising degree of teamwork with only two swords between them.\n\nRagetti, Pintel and Elizabeth made it back to the Black Pearl, which was soon targeted by the Kraken. Ragetti joined the battle, injuring one of the beast's tentacles with a cannonball. He later saved Elizabeth from being dragged into the sea, and both he and Pintel fled the ship while the Kraken dragged it and its captain to Davy Jones' Locker.\n\nRagetti joined his new crew in lamenting the loss of Captain Jack Sparrow in Tia Dalma's shack. Tia Dalma suggested going to World's End, to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. Ragetti agreed to embark on the quest along with all the other surviving crew. It transpired that this journey would be led by none other than Hector Barbossa, resurrected by Tia Dalma herself. Once more under the command of his former captain, Ragetti and his fellow crew members traveled to Singapore, to convince the Pirate Lord Sao Feng to loan them a ship and crew, as well as steal the navigational charts to Davy Jones' Locker.\n\nWhile Barbossa and Elizabeth met with Feng, and Will searched for the charts, Ragetti and the other crewmen swam underwater to a sewer opening. While Tia Dalma distracted the locals, the crew cut through the bars of the sewer opening, and broke into Sao Feng's bath house. The crew secured the steam room, right below Feng's meeting with Barbossa. Ragetti took advantage of the situation by looking up Elizabeth's skirt. Ragetti tried to let Pintel have a look, but when Pintel looked through the cracks of the floor, a large man with a huge belly had moved into Elizabeth's place, earning Pintel's disgust.\n\nAs it happened, the meeting began to go sour\u2013\u2013Will had been captured\u2013\u2013so the crew popped weapons though the floor boards to Barbossa and Elizabeth. Before anything could happen, however, the East India Trading Company attacked the bath house. The crew destroyed a portion of the floor, killing several soldiers in the process. Ragetti and the others then popped up and joined the battle. The battle raged out onto the streets, where the crew managed to receive the Hai Peng and the navigational charts. The crew then set off to World's End and Davy Jones' Locker.\n\nAfter sailing through a frozen landscape, which Ragetti tried to remain optimistic about, the Hai Peng became lost, and Barbossa sailed the ship off the edge of the world. Ragetti and the others washed up on a beach, but before they could begin their search for Sparrow, Tia Dalma assured them that he was closer than they thought, and the Black Pearl appeared over a dune, and glided down into the sea, much to the crew's amazement. Jack Sparrow jumped off the ship to greet what he thought were hallucinations. When he realized that they were real, he recruited Tia Dalma, Gibbs, Cotton, Marty, and Sao Feng's men for his crew, leaving the others on the beach. Jack rejected Ragetti on the grounds that he was frightened by him. Barbossa was able to get them on the Pearl anyway, by denying Sparrow the navigational charts needed to get out of the Locker.\n\nThe crew sailed through an endless sea, and encountered the souls of all those that die at sea. Some were floating in the water, and Ragetti suggested dropping a cannon ball on them. Before Ragetti or Pintel could do this however, Tia Dalma confronted them. She told them that the souls should be in the care of Davy Jones. She also told them that Davy Jones was once a man, not a monster, much to the surprise of Ragetti. Later, Sparrow was finally able to figure out the clues in Sao Feng's charts, and began rocking the ship so that it would capsize, and when the sun set, the Pearl would be propelled back into the living world. Ragetti tied himself and Pintel to the mast so that they would be right side up when the ship turned over. This seemed like a good plan at the time, but when the ship rose up into the living world, and a conflict broke out between Barbossa and Sparrow, Pintel became angry with Ragetti, since they were unable to participate. By the time they had become untied, however, the crew realized that they had wet powder in their pistols, and the conflict subsided.\n\nThe Pearl sailed to an island to gather fresh water. Ragetti and Pintel discovered the dead Kraken on the beach, and began prodding it with a stick. Everyone else took this as an ominous sign. While examining the island's water supply, Sao Feng's men turned on them, and gave them to Sao Feng himself, who had come to capture the Pearl in his ship, the Empress. Will had apparently made a deal with Feng so he could get the Pearl to rescue his father. When Jack asked if anyone had come to save him from the Locker just because they missed him, Ragetti was one of the ones who raised his hand, much to Sparrow's surprise. Feng betrayed Will however, and not only took the Pearl for himself, but handed Jack over to Beckett, who had come in his ship, the HMS Endeavour. The Company seized the Pearl from Feng, who had been promised ownership, however, and Barbossa made a deal with the frustrated Feng, and gave him Elizabeth in return for aiding them in their escape. The Empress attacked the Endeavour, and the Pearl was able to escape with Jack. The crew then sailed to Shipwreck Cove, the meeting place of the Brethren Court.\n\nAt Shipwreck Cove, Ragetti collected all of the pieces of eight from the Pirate Lords in a small bowl, including his own wooden eye which was revealed to be Barbossa's piece of eight, which Ragetti had been looking after for him. After his eye was taken, Ragetti replaced it with an eye patch. He stood in awe when the Code, kept within the Pirata Codex, was brought forth by Captain Teague. Ragetti had little other part in the meeting, except at the end, when Barbossa signaled for Ragetti to steal the pieces of eight, so that he could release Calypso, against the wishes of the Brethren.\n\nDuring Calypso's release, Ragetti's wooden eye was burnt along with the other pieces of eight. He himself aided in freeing Calypso from her human form by saying to her, \"Calypso, I release you from your human bonds,\" as a lover would. This set her free, and Ragetti watched as Calypso grew to an enormous height, and then exploded into thousands of crabs.\n\nHe later participated in the decisive battle against Lord Beckett and the East India Trading Company around Calypso's maelstrom, and as always, he fought alongside Pintel. They fired cannons throughout the battle and witnessed the wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann preceded over Barbossa.\n\nThe two saved Will Turner by firing Jack the Monkey into the face of Maccus who had Will cornered and later saved the Pearl from sinking by using a chain-shot to free the mast from where it jammed against the Flying Dutchman's. He survived the battle, and manned the cannons during the attack on the Endeavour, helping to destroy Beckett's ship.\n\nRagetti remained onboard the Pearl when Barbossa commandeered it, leaving Jack Sparrow behind at Tortuga. By this time, Ragetti had begun carving himself a new wooden eye. Ragetti and some other crewmen, however, felt guilty about leaving Jack Sparrow behind, and tried to get Barbossa's bearings to the Fountain of Youth. However, Sparrow had cut out a hole in Barbossa's map. His further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ragetti"}}

When he was a young boy, one of Jack Sparrow's duties was to feed the dog. Unlike other dogs, this one had a taste for rum.\n\nA few years later, Jack's friend Christophe-Julien de Rapièr was accused of being one of the infamous rogue pirates who broke the Code of the Pirate Brethren. He and his whole crew were imprisoned in the dungeons of Shipwreck City and sentenced to hang. To help Christophe to escape, Jack and his friend Esmeralda sneaked into Teague's cabin on the Troubadour, and stole the keys from the dog.\n\nThrough unknown circumstances, the dog ended up in the British colony of Port Royal, Jamaica. The dog served at Fort Charles prison around the time of Jack Sparrow's incarceration. Jack took one look at his doggy jailer and decided that he was no more likely to hand over the keys than a human guard. Desperate to avoid the hangman, the seedy prisoners try to coax the Prison Dog, who held a ring of keys in his mouth, to their cell. One prisoner holds a loop of rope and another waggles a bone, while the dog just sits and cocks his head. \"The dog is never going to move.\" Jack told his fellow prisoners as they try and lure the hound within reach with a bone. Jack's criminal companions were desperate to avoid the hangman. Though they can't tempt the Prison Dog, a cannonball sets them free.\n\nAs the Prison Dog cowered under a long bench, with the key ring still in his mouth. Jack then picks up the bone from the other cell, and tried coax the dog to him. The dog crawled out from under the bench as Jack continued to coax him closer. The key ring was nearly within Jack's reach, until the dog's attention went to the door into the cell block and dashed away as the door burst open. Two pirates, Koehler and Twigg, step in looking for the armory.\n\nGovernor Weatherby Swann later inquires as to the whereabouts of the Prison Dog (and the keys he carries) when seeking an interview with his daughter during her imprisonment in a cell at the Fort Charles prison.\n\nWhen Pintel and Ragetti were held in the prisons following the battle at Isla de Muerta, Pintel used a trick that allowed him to gain possession of both the keys and the dog, who accompanied them to Pelegosto Island. There, the dog was left behind by the crew of the Black Pearl, though the Pelegostos made him their new chief. It was customary for the Pelegostos to consume the flesh of their chiefs, in the belief that it would release their divine spirit from its fleshy prison.\n\nThe Prison Dog somehow managed to avoid this grisly fate, and joined the Brethren Court at Shipwreck Cove, where he provided Captain Teague with the key to the Pirata Codex. Pintel and Ragetti were baffled as to how the dog could have escaped the island, though Teague's only explanation was that it escaped with the help of \"sea turtles\"\u2014an excuse commonly favored by his son.

They were also employed to act as bodyguards, able to keep out any unwanted visitors. They were highly proficient in martial arts and sword-fighting, and would sometimes use the steel chopsticks in their hair as weapons.\n\nLian was aboard the Empress when Sao Feng brought Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Carolina aboard after interrupting their voyage to Shanghai during the time of the Shadow Lord's threat. Along with her sister, Lian shamelessly flirted with Jack Sparrow behind her master's back, and he returned the same in kind. When Sparrow agreed to procure the Deep Sea Opal for Sao Feng, her master ordered her to accompany Jack to ensure there were no tricks.\n\nLian guided Jack, Billy Turner, and Diego de Leon down through the depths of the sea all the way to an air-filled cavern at the bottom of the ocean, continuing to blatantly flirt with Jack along the way. Making their way across the cave, Lian and the other pirates came across a tunnel with a strange multicolor light glowing at the end of it. As they passed through, the tunnel opened up into an enormous cave, where the quartet discovered the source of the strange rainbow light: a sleeping giant snake with bright, swirling colors shifting through its irredescent scales. After getting over their initial awe of the magnificent creature, Lian and the others realized that it was guarding yet another cave, the only exit from the room. The pirates managed to tiptoe past the unconscious Rainbow Serpent and duck into the next cavern, where they found a pool of clear water lit by a glow from within its depths. Drawing closer, Lian realized that the mystical light was coming from the giant Deep Sea Opal shimmering within the center of the water. Jack attempted to get Lian to grab the opal for him when Billy and Diego turned him down, but she flatly refused. As Jack went to touch the opal, Lian saw the surface of the water start to bubble, and then a female creature emerge from its depths, which turned out to be the mermaid Morveren. Startled, Lian and the others turned to the exit of a cave in hopes of escape, only to find that it was blocked by the head of the now very awake Rainbow Serpent. After Sparrow traded his mystical miniature stone head to Morveren for the opal, Lian and the other pirates made their way out of the cave and back to the surface through a waterspout portal, and a delighted Sao Feng took them all to Liang Dao's palace.\n\nWhen the group arrived at the palace and Sao Feng used the Deep Sea Opal to claim Liang Dao's throne, Lian and Park threw themselves into the fray when a massive battle broke out between Dao and Feng's men. Slicing and slashing Liang Dao's men with their steel-tipped fans, Lian and Park's efforts helped Feng's side emerge victorious, and he became the new Pirate Lord of the South China Sea. With the battle over, Lian and her sister resumed their suggestive flirtations with Jack, prompting him to trick Sao Feng into ordering them to accompany him aboard the Black Pearl during their journey to Hong Kong. During the voyage she and Park gave Jack a massage before being interrupted by the zombie, Alex.\n\nUpon their arrival in Hong Kong, Lian and her sister disguised themselves as EITC agents along with Jack, Billy, Carolina, Diego, and Jean so they could travel through the streets without detection. The group was stopped by Benedict Huntington however, who wanted a report of their patrol to impress his wife, Barbara. Barbara came close to discovering Lian's rouse, as she noticed how feminine her, Park, and Carolina looked under their EITC uniforms, but her concerns were brushed off by her husband, who was fooled into letting the pirates go when Jack feigned having leprosy. Continuing to follow the route drawn for them by Sao Feng, Lian and the others were eventually stopped by a gang of Mistress Ching's men, who believed them to be genuine EITC agents. When Ching began recalling Jack's mannerisms and Sao Feng showed up in a nearby ally, Lian and the others were guided by Ching to the Pirate Lord's opium den to commence the meeting.\n\nWhen Benedict Huntington and Liang Dao launched their surprise attack on the opium den during the meeting, Lian and her twin saved their master's life by throwing themselves forward and knocking Sao Feng out of the way when Huntington fired a bullet at him. She and Park fought bravely against Huntington's EITC agents in the den as well as in the square in front of the shack when the fighting moved to the streets following Jack's setting of the shanty on fire. With Lian's help, the Pirate Lords' side were able to drive the EITC agents back across the square, forcing them to retreat. After Sao Feng and Mistress Ching officially forged an alliance, Lian and Park accompanied their master back to the Empress.\n\nLian still served Sao Feng during the time of Hector Barbossa's meeting with the Pirate Lord at his bath house. Both twins remembered their time with Sparrow aboard the Black Pearl, as they recognized the name with a slight giggle only to be silenced by their captain. The meeting went from bad to worse, but was interrupted when troops of the East India Trading Company burst into the bath house. Lian and Park fought the soldiers alongside their master, but when the soldiers' leader, Ian Mercer, walked into the bath house, he shot at Elizabeth Swann. Unfortunately, Will Turner pushed Elizabeth out of the way, and Mercer's shot hit Park instead, killing her instantly.\n\nSao Feng and his men escaped the bath house, and continued the fight on the streets of Singapore. Lian, seeking revenge, ambushed Mercer in a small storehouse. A brief struggle ensued, and Lian was able to stab Mercer with one of the steel chopsticks from her hair. Mercer then shoved Lian to the ground and although she struggled, shot the woman killing her immediately.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lian"}}

Will Parker's crucial role in the raid on Cádiz, Spain, led by Sir Francis Drake himself, made Parker a pirate among pirates. He sailed away a rich man, and hadn't much need for pirating after that. Will Parker lived like a King and did as he pleased which is what most pirates want, being the lazy folks they are. Finding the location of Parker's final resting place is what motivates Gil. Some says it was in Java, others say it's a remote island off the coast of Africa.

Mary Brennan, her mother was the daughter of a servant woman who had an affair with her employer, lawyer William Cormac. His wife soon discovered the affair and William Cormac, Mary Brennan, and a young Anne crossed the Atlantic to flee the scandal. They settled in Charleston, Carolina.\n\nAnne was soon bored with life on her father's plantation, and was drawn to a life of adventure. Before Anne was out of her teens she married James Bonny, a renegade seaman and sometimes pirate. At this time pirates frequented Charleston. James planned to steal William Cormac's land through the marriage but Anne's father disowned her before this could be done. Legend has it that in retaliation, Anne burned the plantation to the ground.\n\nThey fled to the Bahamas and settled on the island of New Providence back then. James proved a coward and a traitor, became a paid snitch for the governor. Anne preferred the company of the island's notorious pirates and women and soon distanced herself from James.\n\nAfter meeting the pirate Calico Jack Rackham (nicknamed for his loud striped pants) she became romantically involved with him. He had just commandeered a ship full of liquor from his former boss, pirate captain Charles Vane. When James Bonny objected to the affair, he abducted Anne, brought her naked before Governor Woodes Rogers and charged her with the felony of deserting him. Calico Jack suggested instead putting Anne up for sale to the highest bidder because Anne was considered to be stolen property (a 'kinder' legal practice for divorce at the time). James got a court order forbidding Jack and Anne to see each other. Despite Jack's rather less-than-romantic proposal, Anne ran away with Calico Jack and joined his ship's crew, apparently disguised as a man.\n\nAfter Rackham and his men captured a British vessel, Anne saw a young strapping sailor among the newly-captured prize and decided that she would have her way with him. To Anne's surprise, when she got the man alone, he opened his blouse and he exposed to Anne that he too was a woman, Mary Reade. Mary also joined Rackham's crew.\n\nIn 1720, a former pirate turned pirate-hunter, Captain Barnet, attacked Calico Jack's ship. Barnet caught Rackham and his crew. Attacking with cannon fire so thick the men hid below decks. Anne is said to have shouted, \"If there's a man among ye, ye'll come out and fight like the men ye are to be.\" When this got no response, they were outraged by the men's cowardice. Anne and Mary shot the male pirates, killing one and wounding several including Jack Rackham. Only Anne Bonny and Mary Reade stood their ground, fighting furiously. But despite Anne and Mary's ferocity, the pirates were captured and taken to Jamaica.\n\nAt this time women had few rights, however it was illegal to execute a pregnant woman so Anne and Mary, \"plead their bellies,\" claiming to be pregnant.All were hanged, except for Anne and Mary.

He captained a number of ships, usually maintaining a small fleet of three or four. Low captured at least a hundred ships during his short career, burning most of them. Although he was active for only three years, Low remains notorious as one of the most cruel pirates of his time, with a reputation for violently torturing his victims before killing them."],"name":"Edward Low","description":"Edward Low was born in London, England, around 1690. As a young man, he was said to be a pickpocket and gambler. As he grew older, Low tired of pickpocketing and thievery, and turned to burglary. Eventually, he left England, and traveled alone to the New World around 1710. He spent three to four years in various locations, before settling in Boston. On 12 August 1714, he married Eliza Marble. They had a son, who died when he was an infant, and then a daughter named Elizabeth, born in the winter of 1719. Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low with his daughter.\n\nAt first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston. Low was employed as a patron, supervising the loading and carrying of the logs. One day, he returned to the ship when hungry, but was told by the captain he would have to wait to eat, and that he and his men would have to be satisfied with a ration of rum. At this, Low \"took up a loaded musket and fired at the captain but missed him, [and] shot another poor fellow through the throat\". Following this failed mutiny, Low and his friends were forced to leave the boat. A day later, Low led the twelve-man gang in taking over a small sloop off the coast of Rhode Island. Killing one man during the theft, Low and his crew turned pirate, determined \"to go in her, make a black Flag and declare War against all the World.\"\n\nLow, using his newly captured ship, lay in wait on the popular shipping route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island, and plundered it. His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm. He then captured a number of unarmed merchantmen near Port Rosemary.\n\nLow headed south and began operating in the waters of the Grand Caymans, with a period as lieutenant to the established pirate George Lowther, who captained the Happy Delivery, a 100-ton Rhode Island sloop with eight cannons and ten swivel guns. When she was \"destroyed by Indians\", Lowther and his crew transferred to a sloop named the Ranger. Lowther's crew was constantly expanded by desperate sailors willing to join him.\n\nFollowing a number of successful raids, Lowther eventually captured a large 6-gun brigantine named Rebecca on 28 May 1722. He gave it to Low to captain. With a crew of 44, Low amicably dissolved his partnership with Lowther.\n\nIn one notable raid in June 1722, Low and his crew attacked thirteen New England fishing vessels sheltering at anchor in Port Roseway in Nova Scotia. Although outnumbered, Low hoisted his pirate flag and declared that no mercy would be given to the fishermen if any resisted. The fleet submitted and Low's men robbed every vessel. Low chose the largest, an 80-ton schooner which he renamed the Fancy and armed with 10 guns, to become his flagship. He sank the other ships of the fleet, and abandoned the Rebecca. A number of the fishermen were forced to join Low's crew.\n\nOf the coast of St. John's in Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man of war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean to the Azores. There, he captured a French pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He moved on to the Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.\n\nLow abandoned his plans for plundering the rich shipping trade off the coast of Brazil, and moved on to the Caribbean. George Roberts, a mate on the British ship King Sagamore, recounted a meeting with Low aboard the Pink. Roberts' ship was captured by Low's fleet, of which he was now styling himself \"Commodore\".\n\nForty leagues to the east of Surinam, Low and his fleet of two ships dropped anchor to remove growth such as seaweed and barnacles from the outside of the boats, necessary because no dry dock was available to pirates. Still relatively inexperienced, Low ordered too many men to the outside of the boat to work on the buildup, and the Rose Pink tipped over too far. The portholes had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The Pink had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low\u2014by now captaining a captured schooner, the Squirrel\u2014and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint per man, per day.\n\nFailing to reach their initial destination of Tobago due to light winds and strong currents, Low's depleted fleet made it to Grenada, a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed the Ranger), gave the schooner Squirrel to his quartermaster, Francis Spriggs, who renamed it the Delight before sailing away in the middle of the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.\n\nThe new fleet captured many more sloops, including one Low kept, naming it the Fortune. Following this, Low's fleet captured a Portuguese ship called the Nostra Signiora de Victoria on 25 January 1723. The Victoria's Portuguese captain allowed a bag containing approximately 11,000 gold moidores to fall into the sea rather than see it captured. One of Low's most noted episodes of cruelty followed: in his rage, he slashed off the Portuguese captain's lips with a cutlass, broiled them, and forced the victim to eat them while still hot. He then murdered the remaining crew.\n\nA snow called the Unity was added to the fleet, and used as a tender, but was abandoned during an encounter with a man of war named the Mermaid. As Low's success increased in the Caribbean, so did his notoriety. Eventually, a bounty was placed on his head, and Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up with Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Edward Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.\n\nLow, Harris and their ships left the Azores for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they suffered a resounding defeat in a battle with HMS Greyhound, a heavily armed man of war. The Greyhound had been dispatched under the command of Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the Fancy with a minimum crew and £150,000 on board and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the Ranger behind.\n\nLow sailed north. He captured a whaling vessel 80 miles (130 km) out at sea, and in a foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound and the loss of his right hand man, Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. Remaining off the coast of North America, his crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.\n\nHeading south again, Low captured a 22-gun French ship and a large Virginian merchant vessel, the Merry Christmas, in late June 1723. Following the defeat by the Greyhound, Low became \"peculiarly cruel\" to his English victims. His fleet of three ships rejoined forces with George Lowther in July. In late 1723, Low and Lowther's fleet captured the Delight off the coast of Guinea, mounting fourteen guns on her, with command being given to Spriggs. Two days later, Spriggs and Lowther both abandoned Low, leaving him the Merry Christmas, by now mounted with 34 guns, as his sole ship.\n\nIt is unknown what happened with Low after that. He disappeared from the sea, leaving many rumors behind him. Some say that the Low's ship was last sighted near the Canaries and Guinea, another rumor says that Low was sailing for Brazil and another that Low's ship sank in a storm with the loss of all hands.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Edward_Low"}}

He works in a three-story office building just in front of Alan Milds' store."],"name":"Diarmuid Sargent","description":"Sometime before 1630, Diarmuid established a three-story building within Oxbay as his main office. He has since been in charge of a loaning business, carefully watching over clients whenever they loaned money from him. Through this enterprise, Diarmuid seemingly gained large sums of money from it, being able to store some jewels in his office's chest, as well as purchasing elegant-looking clothing.\n\nWhen Nathaniel Hawk arrived in Oxbay after a storm heavily damaged his ship, his boatswain Malcolm Hatcher suggested that Nathaniel borrow some money from Oxbay's loan shark (Diarmuid, of course), then purchase goods from Alan Milds' store nearby to import to Redmond.\n\nA highly frugal man, as any loan shark was in the archipelago, Diarmuid would not be too eager to loan large sums of gold to his clients. For him, the lesser, the better. Whenever a client would request for a large sum of money to be loaned from him, Diarmuid got slightly nervous, calling it a \"risky\" process.\n\nDiarmuid was always quite happy to accept an investment from his client, calling such an individual \"intelligent\" for deciding to do so. Used to, and seemingly enjoying the presence of money around him, he would be a little disappointed when his client would ask for the money back.\n\nVery particular about the trustworthiness of his client, Diarmuid would regularly warn him not to \"pocket\" his money - as a \"friendly reminder\", claiming to have longtime experience in his field. Indeed it would be unwise for the client to \"pocket\" the money - in other words, not pay back the loan within the alloted time period - as Diarmuid may have been prone to spread unpleasant rumors about the client's transgression, lowering the client's reputation in the eyes of the archipelago's inhabitants.\n\nSeeming to indicate that he was a well-moneyed man, Diarmuid wore elegant clothing, consisting of a fine-looking green undershirt, over which he wore a sleek blue coat with frills. He had long, black hair, and a top hat. Visibly plump, it is possible that Diarmuid would enjoy good meals with the large amounts of gold his clients probably invested to him.\n\nInterestingly, the player can actually treat Diarmuid the loan shark like some kind of infinite money supply; ask for a sum of money, and then before talking to him again, hide all his gold in the chest just behind him, within Diarmuid's office. Then, if the player speaks to him again, he will not ask for the money back; in fact, the player can ask for another loan! This process can be repeated for as long as the player wants. However, watch out - for if you cannot pay all that money back, your reputation will decrease terribly!\n\nOne way to easily mend this problem is to donate large sums of money to the Church, to raise back one's reputation in case it has plummeted due to not repaying the money on time. It is important to have one's reputation up, as having an extremely low reputation normally leads to store owners, loan sharks, and perhaps even key figures in the game's storyline to avoid your presence.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Diarmuid_Sargent"}}

At this time he was captain of the small trading vessel Victory. Upon his arrival at Oxbay his ship mate, Malcom Hatcher, retired to spend a quiet life on land. Nathaniel hires crew, fixes his ship, buys a new spyglass, and sells chocolate and leather. Having hired a new crew Nathaniel set sail, however shortly after his departure a French squadron attacked and conquered the city of Oxbay. As captain of the only vessel to escape Oxbay, Nathaniel was obligated to report to Silehard; Governor of Redmond Island, the nearest British colony.\n\nNathaniel explained the invasion to the Governor, who then insisted on commandeering the Victory for military service in the approaching conflict with the French. However he managed to talk the Governor out of it and was instead employed as the Governors right-hand man. As his first assignment Nathaniel was ordered to sneak into the occupied city of Oxbay in order to gather information about the French military's future plans.\n\nHe moored his ship on a beach far from the city of Oxbay and made his way through the jungle before reaching the outskirts. Nathaniel entered Oxbay tavern and spoke with its keeper, Everard Gordon. Gordon told him that local citizens were ready to assist him in anyway to free Oxbay. Due to the outrageous behaviour of the French the locals feared and hated them.\n\nNathaniel approached one of the senior French soldiers, Massoni, and began to speak with him, affecting to offer his service to the French military. Nathaniel's plan was to get Massoni as drunk as possible and thereby extract information from him. Nathaniel lured the drunken soldier out into the jungle and, under threat of death, Massoni told him of the barque Oiseau that was docked at Falaise de Fleur, a French colony. The Oiseau was to deliver ammunition to the French squadron, but could not put to sea without an escort ship.\n\nNathaniel then sailed to Falaise de Fleur and met with harbor master, Amiel Berangere. Amiel then gave him The Honor to escort the Oiseu barque to Oxbay island by giving him a letter of identification. Nathaniel was then introduced to the captain of the barque, Virgile Boon. However once the ship was out in open water the Victory opened fire and sank the Oiseau, leaving the French military without ammunition.\n\nOnce he returned to Redmond Governor Silehard hired Nathaniel to escort the sloop Albion to Oxbay. The Albion contained a regiment of English troops who were going to attack the French occupiers.\n\nNathaniel then met with a man called Wilfred in Greenford who recommended that they land soldiers at night on a small deserted beach so the French wouldn't sniff out their operation.\n\nHowever in the area in which Nathaniel agreed to meet with Wilfred a French patrol appeared. Luckily, not a single French soldier managed to escape and give the alarm. Then Wilfred took the English soldiers to a cave where they were to conceal themselves until they were needed. Nathaniel then accompanied captain of the Albion, Ewan Glover, to Greenford where they parted ways.\n\nNathaniel then traveled to Oxbay tavern to meet with Tobias, an operative who had managed to bribe one of the captains of the French squadron.\n\nUnfortunately, while they were talking, several French guards rushed into the tavern and Nathaniel was forced to fight to avoid capture. Tobias and Nathaniel were forced to flee the tavern whilst avoiding French soldiers patrolling the streets. Oweyn Mc Dorey, a shipwright who was sympathetic to their cause, hid them from the French soldiers. Oweyn was questioned but managed to steer the soilders away. Afterwards Oweyn asked Nathaniel to return a chest to the owner of the Redmond tavern.\n\nThe next morning Tobias met with captain Rabel Yverneau just outside the tavern, in a concealed back-lot. Tobias, Rabel and Nathaniel attempted to leave in Rabels ship but once they were noticed by French guards they were chased. Rabels ship was fired upon by several French crafts, though they eventually outran them.\n\nUpon meeting with him Governor Silehard ordered Nathaniel to take part in the liberation of Oxbay.

Ponce de León received an education in fighting skills, manners, and religion while serving a knight named Pedro Nunez de Guzman, and later helped in the ten-year conquest of the Muslim kingdom of Granada in southern Spain.\n\nJuan Ponce de León accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the New World, later he helped conquering eastern Hispaniola and was appointed governor of the province of Higuey. He conquered Puerto Rico and was appointed it's first governor. In 1512 he removed from office and started an expedition to the lands north of Cuba.\n\nIn 1513, Ponce de León, a Spanish explorer and conquistador, discovered Florida during his search for the Fountain of Youth, but legends say that he never found it. He returned to Spain, later he tried to conquer Guadeloupe and was re-appointed Governor of Puerto Rico. In 1521 he organized another expedition to Florida, during which he was supposedly wounded with a poisoned arrow. He aborted the expedition and returned to Havanna.\n\nTwo years later, Ponce de León led another expedition to discover the marvels of the New World. But his ship, the Santiago, was caught in a storm, and ended up on the edge of a cliff on an unchartered island. Through mysterious circumstances, almost all of the crew members, including Ponce de León himself, were soon dead. Holding a personal map of San Miguel in his hand, Ponce de León's corpse remained in a bed found in the captain's quarters aboard the Santiago. Only one Spanish sailor survived, ending up lost at sea for two centuries, carrying the logbook that chronicled every detail of Ponce de León's journey to the Fountain. Sometime after 1523, the route taken by Ponce de León was depicted on Mao Kun Map, the navigational charts that led to otherworldly realms. Ever since rumors floated of Ponce de León's search, many men had sought the Fountain for the next two centuries.\n\nIn 1750, the quest for the Fountain of Youth began after the ancient sailor brought the ship's log to the Spanish King Ferdinand VI. By that time, Ponce de León's now-skeletal corpse would still be in the bed in the captain's quarters of the Santiago.

But when he put his hands on it, Ponce's head turned towards him. Barbossa silently told Jack to not touch the map, which Jack did, making Ponce's head turn back to the map.

Thinking he was an imposter, Scrum made fun of Jack after the latter asked \"Do you have any idea who I am, mate?\", saying that he forgot his own name, in which the crew laughed at Jack.\n\nSoon afterwards, the Royal Guards arrived to the Captain's Daughter and alerted their presence to Angelica, who was confronted by Jack. Scrum attempted to barricade the door to avoid dealing with the Guards, but ran right before they bursted in. As Jack and Angelica fought the guards, Scrum escaped the building. He would later meet with Angelica, who was able to get Jack unconscious, and made their way to Angelica's ship.\n\nAbout five days into the voyage, Scrum woke Jack Sparrow up to work aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, which brought surprised Jack in realizing he was aboard the ship of Blackbeard. While doing their duties, mopping and scrubbing the deck, Scrum befriended Jack aboard while showing him the ropes around the Revenge. He told Jack of Blackbeard's zombie officers as well as Philip Swift's imprisonment aboard. Scrum later met with Jack and some of the other crewmen, who were not satisfied with sailing under Angelica and her zombie crew, and took part in Jack's mutiny aboard the Revenge. He and the other crewmen were convinced by Jack to mutiny as they were heading for certain death at the Fountain of Youth.\n\nKnowing that they faced certain death unless they took the ship, Scrum told the crew to take the ship, though the crew didn't do so until Jack himself said it. In the fight, Scrum dueled with many of the zombie crewmen. Jack's crew were soon victorious until Blackbeard himself came out of his cabin. Blackbeard, in response to being told that this was a mutiny, hung all of the crewmen, including Scrum, with the rigging of the Queen Anne's Revenge. Scrum and the rest of the crewmen were let down to witness the Cook's punishment.\n\nAs the search continued, the pirates were led to Whitecap Bay, in search of a mermaid's tear for the Profane Ritual. Scrum was put in one of the various longboats, and the spotlight from the tower was cast on his boat. He, with Philip, Purser, Ezekiel, Cabin Boy, Derrick, and a few other pirates, were ordered to sing by Gunner, in order to lure the mermaids.\n\nAs the first mermaid, named Tamara, arrived, she asked if Scrum was the one who was singing. He said yes, and wanted a kiss. The others tried to hold him back, but Scrum insisted he would have a kiss from a proper mermaid. Tamara then started to sing, making other mermaids show up, and then lured Scrum underwater, where he saw her true form. Scrum screamed as Tamara tried to attack, only to be warded off by Ezekiel, who hit her with an oar. The mermaids then attacked. Scrum's boat was destroyed and he was caught in the net by the rest of the crew, mistaken for a mermaid. When they unraveled the net, all they saw was a lovestruck Scrum.\n\nWith a mermaid captured, the crew proceeded to the fountain. Once there, Hector Barbossa and his own crew came to kill Blackbeard. As the fight commenced, Angelica had Scrum follow her to the Fountain. With the Chalices, and the tear, Angelica and Scrum had to face Jack, who wanted the items. An interesting switch occured and Scrum was left to continue fighting others.\n\nWhen Barbossa fatally wounded Blackbeard, he claimed his sword, ship, and crew for himself. Scrum and the other surviving members of Blackbeard's crew followed him back to the Queen Anne's Revenge, where Scrum witnessed Barbossa's usage of Blackbeard's sword to make the ship sail at a fast speed to Tortuga.\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time serving aboard the Revenge, Scrum joined Jack Sparrow and his crew on the Dying Gull, participating in multiple failed crimes, the most notable of which was the robbery of the bank of Saint Martin, in which they procured a single coin. After Jack informed the crew that they had to pay him for the failure, his entire crew, including Scrum, lost all faith in their Captain and abandoned him.\n\nShortly after their separation a young man named Henry Turner, the son of William Turner, paid them to save their ex-captain from the guillotine, as well as a young woman named Carina Smyth from being hanged. This led to a battle between soldiers and pirates, with Scrum going in search of the woman. He restrained and defeated a soldier with the help of Carina, who was still standing on the gallows, but accidentally activated the trap door meant to result in her death. Luckily, she was caught by Henry.\n\nAfter the escape, the crew went in search of the Trident of Poseidon, not knowing why their re-appointed captain was interested in doing so. The Trident could be found with Diary of Galileo Galilei, which was in possession of Carina Smyth and despite initially denied Help, they managed to help, However in less than a day of travel the crew when the crew discovered that they were being persecuted by the death, they immediately aim their guns at Jack in frustration, which Jack then decides to call upon mutiny, having Henry Turner and Carina Smyth join him on a rowboat. The mutiny ended up putting Joshamee Gibbs as the captain.\n\nShortly afterwards, Gibbs discovered that the Essex were following with the intent to arrest them. Wanting to avoid severe punishment, Gibbs stated that Jack had named Scrum as captain, and so the soldiers gave the unwitting Scrum a beating and locked the crew in the brig. However, the crew managed to pick the lock and escape using a nail torn from Scrum's foot, despite his protests.\n\nThe crew fled in a boat, as they discovered how The Black Pearl had been returned to the ocean and joined the crew, accepting Jack again as their captain.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Scrum"}}

Powerful to the end, Mistress Ching was one of the few pirate captains to retire proper, setting herself up in Canton, a wealthy lady.","Mistress Ching was an elegant woman, with long black hair tied up into a tight bun and clasped with an elaborate headdress. Her face was covered in makeup, with a powdered white face, blushed cheeks, and reddened lips. She wore a light brown blouse and a crimson-and-gold coat embroided with dragons over a dark green skirt, clasped with a jade broach. She also wore three rings, each enclasping a large jewel."],"name":"Ching","description":"Mistress Ching commanded an armada of junks that terrorized the Chinese coasts ever since she took control of the Pirate Confederation of China following her husband's death. She was a profiteer of smuggled trade goods between Japan and China, and her pirates were known to victimize their opponents, with beheadings being their preferred form of execution. She also owned a large chain of brothels and whore houses.\n\nMistress Ching was wanted dead or alive by the East India Trading Company for crimes including sacking and pillaging countless villages, cutting off ears for souvenirs, running a brothel and gambling house, and collaborating with secret societies to systematically extort local merchants. The bounty was worth 3,400 guineas.\n\nDuring the late 1720s, when the rogue pirates began terrorising merchant ships on the high seas, Ching was present at the informal meeting of Pirate Lords at the Great Chamber in Shipwreck City. All Pirate Lords at the meeting agreed to take actions against the rogues, to prevent the navies of Europe from declaring war on piracy. During the meeting, she introduced the young pirate Jack Sparrow to the Pirate Lord Don Rafael and his granddaughter Esmeralda.\n\nA few days later, when Jack Sparrow accused the Pirate Lord Borya Palachnik of being one of the rogues, Captain Edward Teague called for an official court of inquiry. Ching, along with all other Pirate Lords at Shipwreck Cove, was present at the court. She was among those who agreed with the idea of summoning Davy Jones, the supernatural lord of the underwater realms, who could confirm or deny Borya's guilt.\n\nAround the time of the search for the Dead Man's Chest, Mistress Ching was running a brothel in Tortuga, along with her apparent friend, fellow Pirate Lord Eduardo Villanueva. She resisted the summons sent out by Hector Barbossa to attend the fourth meeting of the Brethren Court at Shipwreck City. Soon after this, she was confronted by Jack Sparrow, in Tortuga collecting crewmen to look for the heart of Davy Jones. He was intent on getting both Pirate Lords to attend the conclave. After chasing Eduardo Villanueva through the streets of Tortuga and engaging him in a duel, he cornered Ching, who was more than willing to duel Sparrow. During the heated duel, Sparrow was able to knock Ching's head against a gong, knocking her out cold and defeating her. Once she recovered, Ching and Villanueva agreed to join the Brethren and sailed to Shipwreck Island.\n\nDuring the meeting, Mistress Ching opposed Captain Elizabeth Swann's idea of fighting the armada of the East India Trading Company's Governor, Lord Cutler Beckett, believing the Brethren to be secure within the fortress-like Shipwreck Cove, but decided against this when Jack pointed out they would all kill each other off. But she only supported the idea of fighting completely once Swann was voted Pirate King. The East India Trading Company sent a force of Black Coats against the Brethren, and they separated the Pirate Lords from one another and attacked. Mistress Ching and Villanueva were trapped in the Market Area. They fought off the Black Coats and Blue Coats soldiers. With the assistance of Jack Sparrow, they were able to defeat the soldiers and Black Coats, and made it to their ships. She and her crew later witnessed the battle of Calypso's maelstrom, and celebrated with her crew after the deaths of Lord Beckett and Davy Jones. Soon after the battle, Mistress Ching returned to China, and retired to Canton, incredibly wealthy.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ching"}}

He was given a ticket aboard the Sea Star to North Carolina as his hometown was in a dire situation after all the fish died. Billy was arrested after the Sea Star's captain, David Donovan, called him a stowaway when his ticket was classed as counterfeit (a fact unbeknownst to Uncle Seamus who gave Billy the ticket) by the Royal Navy.\n\nBilly was subsequently jailed, and taken aboard a naval ship to Port Royal to be hanged. But along the way, was freed by Arabella Smith and Jean Magliore, who had infiltrated the ship trying to get the records of the Fleur De La Mort, aboard which Jean and Arabella were crewmembers under Arabella's mother, Laura. Billy successfully managed to convince them to free him, and stole the records to gain their trust, whilst the naval crew were preoccupied with an attacking sea monster.\n\nBilly was furious to learn that the Sea Star was responsible for the sea monster's attacks and for placing the Isle of Man in its poor state. Killing the sea monster, Billy stranded Donovan and the First Mate aboard a desert island. He joined the Fleur's crew, under Captain Laura, and helped Jack Sparrow defeat Captain Torrents.\n\nYears later, Billy joined Jack Sparrow's crew aboard the Black Pearl, recently risen from the seas by Davy Jones. Billy helped Jack find several vials of Shadow Gold to be found around the world, often providing a brooding sense to the crew. He revealed that he had eventually made it to North Carolina, and had married a girl who had given birth to a son there.\n\nAfter the quest for the Shadow Gold ended, Bootstrap Bill would remain aboard the Black Pearl, taking part in Jack Sparrow's quest for the treasure of Cortés. Three days out into the voyage, Jack's first mate Hector Barbossa rallied the crew in a mutiny against Jack. While it is possible Bootstrap Bill probably didn't participate in the mutiny, there was a version of events where Bootstrap stood up for Jack, then doesn't participate in the mutiny, stepping aside but doesn't take action to stop it. A man of the Code, Bootstrap did what's right by him and stuck by the Code by staying with the crew. When the mutiny took place, Bootstrap was the only crewmember who did not side with Barbossa completely. However, Bootstrap was unable to nor prevent Jack being marooned on a desert island. Days afterwards, using the bearings acquired from Jack himself, Captain Barbossa was able to find Isla de Muerta. Bootstrap continued to serve on board long enough to take his share of the treasure of 882 pieces of Aztec gold. But Barbossa's crew would soon regret their taking the treasure.\n\nAt some point after spending and trading their pieces of the Aztec gold, every member of Barbossa's crew would learn that they had become cursed. Believing that their torment came from the treasure, the now-cursed crew attempted to lift the curse by reclaiming all 882 pieces of the Aztec gold. However, while Barbossa's crew wanted to lift their curse, Bootstrap Bill still felt guilty of betraying Jack Sparrow by taking part in Barbossa's mutiny, knowing that it wasn't right with the Code. And so Bootstrap sent a piece of the treasure to his son, Will Turner, avowing that the crew deserved to remain cursed for what happened to Jack. Barbossa would eventually learn of this action and became angry with Bootstrap Bill.\n\nIn response of Bootstrap Bill's treachery, Barbossa had a cannon strapped to \"Bootstrap's bootstraps,\" and thrown overboard. The last the crew saw of Bill Turner, he was sinking to the \"crushing, black oblivion of Davy Jones' Locker,\" and was left to suffer a life at the bottom of the ocean. Although he was eternally drowning, Bootstrap Bill was unable to die because of the Aztec curse. It wasn't until after Bootstrap was thrown overboard did Barbossa's crew learn of an additional requirement to lift the curse: all who stole but a single coin from the chest had to repay the heathen gods in blood, including Bootstrap's. And so with the curse having an unlikely chance of lifting, Bootstrap Bill was left to suffer at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nDespite Bootstrap Bill Turner's intention to have Barbossa's crew remaining cursed, the crew still found their hope restored. When Will Turner reversed the curse by returning the last Aztec coins to the stone chest, he technically killed his father because at that moment, somewhere at the bottom of the ocean, Bootstrap Bill became mortal. However, instead of dying at sea, fate had a different plan.\n\nPrior to Will Turner's lifting of the Aztec curse, which technically returned Bootstrap's mortality, the cursed Bootstrap Bill was still trapped at the bottom of the ocean, with the weight of the water crushing down on him, unable to move or die. All he could do was to think, mostly the thought if he had any hope of escaping this fate, he would take it and trade anything for it. This attracted the attention of Davy Jones, captain of the Flying Dutchman, who had a love for a good bargain. Davy Jones came and offered Bootstrap Bill to serve aboard the Dutchman one hundred years before the mast. Cursed by the Aztec Gold and doomed to be trapped there forever, he had been more than willing to bargain with Jones when he had been found by the tentacled man. Convinced that a life of servitude would be better than his current state, Bootstrap sold his soul to Davy Jones to alleviate his eternal suffering. Having made the deal with Jones, Bootstrap Bill Turner joined Jones' crew, where he would become yet another lost soul to serve aboard the Dutchman.\n\nIt is unknown how long Bootstrap Bill served aboard the Flying Dutchman, but it is known that he was aboard for at least one year. During his time aboard, Bootstrap would begin his transformation that every member of the Dutchman had to undergo. He also grew to forget Barbossa, beginning to lapse into total dementia. The longer he was aboard, the more Bootstrap would learn about how life on the Dutchman played out; a man thought he'd cheated death, but he'd lose himself in becoming part of the Dutchman itself. Wyvern was a prime example, Bootstrap's in particular, of what would happen if a man served aboard the Dutchman long enough.\n\nThirteen years after having made a deal with Davy Jones, Jack Sparrow's time ran out. So Davy Jones sent Bootstrap Bill Turner as an emissary to warn Jack that his debt was due to be paid. Bootstrap would find Jack Sparrow aboard the Black Pearl, having already taken it back from Barbossa one year prior. To Bootstrap's dismay, he learned from Jack himself that he retrieved the Pearl with the help of his son, William, who ended up becoming a pirate. During his brief visit, Bootstrap and Jack were catching up, in which time Bootstrap relayed his tale of ending up on the bottom of the ocean before taking Jones' offer, though Jack originally thought he was shanghaied. Bill Turner soon left the Pearl, but not before giving Jack Sparrow the Black Spot, thereby having Jack marked for death at the hands of Jones' leviathan, the Kraken. Having given his old friend Jones' warning, Bootstrap Bill returned to his duties aboard the Dutchman.\n\nDays later, during a stormy night, Bootstrap Bill was working with his fellow crewmen until he finds his son Will Turner aboard the Dutchman. Seeing that Will had ended up on the same wretched vessel as himself, Bootstrap lets go of a rope that was holding up a cannon, thereby causing a disturbance which Will was blamed for. Before the bo'sun, Jimmy Legs, could give Will the punishment of five lashes, Bootstrap stopped him. With the familial connection between Bootstrap Bill and Will revealed, Bootstrap was forced to give Will the five lashes, by means of protecting him, in front of Jones and his crew. After the lashing, Bootstrap explained why he had to do what he did, which Will understood. Bootstrap then talked to Will about life aboard the Dutchman, warning him that he must get away upon learning that Will gave no oath. But Will confided to his father that he wasn't planning on leaving until having found the key, in which Wyvern popped from his place where he became part of the Dutchman to tell the two Turners the secrets of the Dead Man's Chest before going back to being part of the ship.\n\nBootstrap Bill later joined his son as he watched a game of Liar's Dice was played between the Dutchman's crew. To Bootstrap's surprise, Will challenged Davy Jones to a game, in which he was likely to lose. To save his son, Bootstrap Bill entered the game and purposely lost to save Will from losing. As a result, Bootstrap was sentenced to spend an eternity on the Flying Dutchman. Though Will was mad at his father's foolishness, he had gotten what he wanted: the key's location. With Bootstrap's help, Will was able to take the key from Jones in his sleep and escape the Dutchman. Before leaving, Bootstrap gave Will a black knife. Will took the knife with a promise that he'd find a way to free Bootstrap from Jones' servitude, saying \"I will not abandon you. I promise.\"\n\nThe next day, Davy Jones would learn of Will's escape, which enraged him. And as punishment for his part in it, Bootstrap Bill Turner was forced to watch the Kraken attack the Edinburgh Trader, the ship on which Will was on board. As Jones' crew summoned the leviathan, Bootstrap watched in agony and with a heavy heart as his son was seemingly killed in this attack. Davy Jones, telling Bootstrap that he needed time alone with his thoughts, ordered Bootstrap Bill to be locked in the brig.\n\nA few months later, by the time Lord Cutler Beckett assumed control of the Flying Dutchman following his acquisition of the heart of Davy Jones, Bootstrap Bill would still remain in the brig. The apparent death of his son Will Turner caused Bootstrap Bill Turner to sink into a state of madness, so much so that the process of assimilation into the Flying Dutchman accelerated, and Bootstrap's humanity began to wane. When Elizabeth Swann was thrown in the Dutchman's brig, she was able to coax Bootstrap into a conversation, though it was clear that he remembered little of his life. He still recognized the name of his son, however, and held on to the hope that William had promised to rescue him. When he realized who Elizabeth was, he lost hope for his own redemption. Bootstrap told her that Will would have to choose one of them and jokingly stated, \"I wouldn't pick me.\" Elizabeth tried to wake him after he had merged with the ship again, but he appeared to have completely forgotten their prior conversation.\n\nBootstrap Bill remained in the Dutchman's brig, until he heard the bars open in the middle of the night. Admiral James Norrington had helped free Elizabeth and the crew of the Empress to escape to their ship. In his maddened state, Bootstrap followed them to see what was going on. Having not realize Norrington's good intentions, he instead believed that Norrington was leading a prisoner escape and stabbed him in a killing blow. As Elizabeth escaped to the Empress, Bootstrap simply stood by while Norrington passed away. The mad-stricken Bootstrap Bill continued serving aboard the Dutchman on their way to Shipwreck Cove.\n\nBootstrap Bill Turner was still aboard the Flying Dutchman when it was battling with the Black Pearl around Calypso's maelstrom. During the later portion of the battle, Bootstrap found his son on deck, and engaged him in a duel. Will quickly disabled his father, but held back from killing him. The sight of his black knife, in addition to witnessing Davy Jones mortally wound Will in front of Elizabeth and Jack Sparrow, finally snapped Bootstrap out of his delirium. Realizing what happen, Bootstrap attacked Jones in a frenzy, but was quickly defeated. But before Jones could finish him off, however, Jack helped Will stab Jones' heart. Soon afterwards, knowing that the Dutchman must have a captain, Bootstrap cut out his son's heart to allow him to take Davy Jones' place after Jones fell into the maelstrom.\n\nAfter Will became captain of the Flying Dutchman, the Dutchman resurfaced with the ship returning to its normal form. Bootstrap Bill and the other crewmen returned to their original human form. Like the rest of the crew, Bootstrap followed Will's orders and aided the Black Pearl in destroying the Endeavour. Afterwards, Bootstrap asked Will for orders, but Will only told him that he was now free. Though it was what they both longed for, Bootstrap decided to serve under Will, as he feels he owes Will for leaving him and for Will's rescue. With a smile, Will ordered his father to take the helm. Bootstrap then commented that there was a steep price for Will taking captaincy aboard the Dutchman: while the ship now had a purpose again, Elizabeth could not go on the voyages they're able to go on. Bootstrap Bill Turner would continue serving under Captain Will Turner's command.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/William_Turner_Sr."}}

His surviving works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems."],"name":"William Shakespeare","description":"Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.\n\nShakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613 . His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608 , including Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.\n\nMany of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, two of his former theatrical colleagues published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.\n\nIn the 1730s, Captain Jack Sparrow had read books that he would take on voyages, including some of William Shakespeare's plays and most of his poetry. Shakespeare would be a matter of discussion in Jack's young adult life, during his first meeting with Cutler Beckett. Sparrow's First Mate Robert Greene also liked to read some of Shakespeare's books.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/William_Shakespeare"}}

The Guard was one of the cavalry unit that led a chase through the streets of London, where Jack was jumping on top of a carriage and jumping to another carriage until he ended up driving a coal wagon.\n\nAlthough the Royal Guards lost Jack in the chase, this Guard confronted Jack by calling him a \"filthy pirate\" and was about to shoot him before being shot in the back and killed by Jack's father, Captain Teague.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Guard_(Royal_Guard)"}}

Believing Jack had a debt to repay, she joined the line of sailors and accused him of stealing her boat, adding a couple of slaps for emphasis. In turn, Jack offered the Interceptor, knowing Anamaria was a good sailor and that he needed her onboard. Anamaria sailed the Interceptor to Isla de Muerta during Will Turner's attempt to rescue Elizabeth Swann from Hector Barbossa's cursed crew, but was soon imprisoned with the other crewmen in the brig of the Black Pearl. After taking the Black Pearl, Anamaria served under Jack Sparrow's command, embarking on several misadventures before leaving the crew."],"name":"Anamaria","description":"Anamaria was the youngest of five daughters. Her mother, they ran a smuggling business with five boats and a warehouse in Port Royal. The street that the warehouse was located on was under the \"protection\" of a gang calling itself the \"Stingrays\". For her first solo smuggling mission, Anamaria was sent out in one of her family's boats, the Jolly Mon.\n\nUnfortunatly, Anamaria's smuggling trip ended in disaster when she had an encounter with pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Jack wound up stealing the Jolly Mon from her -- or, as the pirate himself put it, \"borrowed without permission, but with every intention of bringing it back\". But he never did, as the Jolly Mon ultimately sank to the bottom of Port Royal harbor.\n\nAnamaria's family was not able to afford a replacement for the Jolly Mon. Believing Jack had a debt to repay for the theft, Anamaria got her chance while in Tortuga.\n\nWith the help of Joshamee Gibbs, Jack was recruiting a motley crew to sail aboard the Interceptor. Concealing her gender, identity, and face under a wide-brimmed hat, she stood near the end of the line of sailors Jack was considering to hire. She shouted a question to the captain, \"What is the benefit for us?\" When Jack came over taking her hat off, she slapped him across the face for emphasis, which Jack admitted that he deserved. Unfortunately, Jack knew Anamaria was a good sailor, and that he needed her onboard. In an attempt to placate her, Jack promised to give her another vessel, which due to the intervention of Will Turner, was the Interceptor. Nevertheless, Anamaria was convinced to join his crew and sail for Isla de Muerta and the Black Pearl.\n\nIndeed, Anamaria steered the ship after Turner rescued Elizabeth, since Jack had fallen behind during the rescue on Isla de Muerta. She was able to outrun the Black Pearl for a time, and engaged its cursed pirates in combat when Barbossa's ship caught up. The crew were ultimately captured and the Interceptor destroyed, and soon after Anamaria and the others found themselves locked in the brig of the Black Pearl.\n\nWhen the ship returned to Isla de Muerta, Elizabeth infiltrated the Pearl and rescued Jack's crew, hoping they would help her rescue Will. However, the pirates, recalling Jack owed them a ship, decided to take the Black Pearl instead. Sometime later, during the planned hanging of Jack Sparrow, Anamaria steered the Black Pearl to Port Royal, where it awaited Jack's escape. With the help of Will Turner, Jack evaded the noose, and fell over the fort. The Pearl rounded the cove, and Jack was brought on board. Anamaria handed over command of the ship to Jack, content to serve simply as one of his crew.\n\nHowever, the wind was not sufficient to allow the Pearl to leave Jamaica, and thus escape Norrington. Three days after rescuing Jack from the gallows, Anamaria joined Jack, Gibbs, and Marty on a trek through the Jamaican jungles to Windward Cove, a place said to be haunted and protected by island magic for years. Despite voicing her concerns over traveling to the Cove, Jack insisted that they continue on, expressing annoyance that they would give in to groundless superstitions.\n\nFinally arriving at the cove, the pirates found it to covered with skeletons that seemed to come to life. When Jack figured out that the skeletons were being manipulated with ropes, the real inhabitants of Windward Cove showed themselves; a community of ex-slaves lead by a woman named Mutti.\n\nAnamaria and the other pirates were lead by Mutti to the settlement. Jack wanted a map that Mutti had in her possession. After Jack helped protect the settlement from a raid by one Mackie Shackles and his crew, Mutti gave the pirates the map Jack wanted for his plans to leave Port Royal and sent them on their way.\n\nDespite having the map, the wind was still not with the Pearl's crew. Still trapped in Port Royal, Anamaria took Jack, Gibbs, and Marty to her family's smuggling headquarters in the town for shelter, with the idea of borrowing another one of her family's boats for transportation in the quest to get the Pearl free. While her sisters were unhappy with hiding Jack after he had stolen from them, much less wanting to use another boat, their mother agreed with Anamaria that they needed Jack free and alive in order to get a replacement boat.\n\nDuring Anamaria and the other's stay, her family got caught up in a gang war. The Stingray gang that had been leveraging protection money from them had split into two gangs when members \"Big Sandy\" and \"Slippery Jim\" had a falling out. Jim's faction, the \"Bowsprit Boys\" insisted that Anamaria's family owed them for the week, despite the money having been already paid. Jack intervened, fighting them off.\n\nWhile Anamaria and the other pirates began getting their borrowed boat ready to leave the port, Jack, hoping to make profit for resupplying the Pearl, pitting the Stingrays and Bowspit Boys against each other in a gang war. With the fight between the gangs, the soldiers that came to arrest them, and an rum-induced dock explosion to provide distraction, Anamaria and the others rowed out in their boat catch the trade winds and follow Mutti's map to its destination.\n\nShe remained aboard during the battle for St. Piran's Blade, and tracked Jack down when he apparently abandoned the crew for a month. She located him in Tortuga, where he was being pursued by James Norrington and his men. Jack used Anamaria as a handy diversion, and fled the scene, though returned to pick her up and escape back to the Black Pearl. She proved highly resourceful during a battle against Jack's former, twice-cursed crew after they hijacked a merchant vessel to ambush Sparrow. Anamaria fired chain-shots at the crew, knocking them overboard, and saved Jack's life by sending Bo'sun into the sea. She was present on the Pearl when Commodore James Norrington lost his ship in a hurricane off the coast of Tripoli.\n\nBy the time Davy Jones called in Jack Sparrow's debt, however, Anamaria was no longer a member of Sparrow's crew. Her further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Anamaria"}}

To stop the monkey, Sparrow withdrew Leech's pistol from his belt and fired at the undead animal.\n\nThe Black Pearl landed at Pelegosto Island and were captured, Leech among those captured by the Pelegostos, the native cannibalistic tribe; the crew members consumed were made into two giant bone cages in which the surviving crew was kept, Leech and several crew members among them. While trapped in the cages, Leech called out to Gibbs that the crew in his cage formulated a plan, but soon dismissed it with a \"never mind!\"\n\nThe crew within the two bone cages swung back and forth from the bridge where the cages were hung, finally grabbing hold of the roots and vines on the cliff side, beginning the climb up. Will Turner, who had been trapped in the other cage, called out that they'd need all the crew to man the Pearl, but Leech called out that they would only technically need six men, taking a moment to catch on to his mistake before putting double efforts into climbing the walls with the crew in his cage.\n\nDuring the climb, one lone Pelegosto warrior walked out on the bridge and was eyed by Will, who told the others in his cage to stop climbing, attempting to warn the others in the opposite cage, but Leech and the others continued to climb until Leech grabbed at what he thought to be a vine, but was actually a snake. Frightened, Leech dropped the snake and cried out, causing such a panic in the bone cage that its captives let go of the vines they were holding onto. The bone cage dropped with such a force that it caused the support rope to snap at the top, sending the captives plunging into the ravine.

Barbossa persuaded Tia Dalma to join on the voyage to World's End, although it was so he could enact his scheme and release Calypso\u2014fulfilling the deal that he made with her after she brought him back from the dead.","Tia Dalma appeared to be an eccentric, but her skills in the realm of magic were exceptional. She could scry (although it was thought inexplicable that she used crab claws for this purpose) and could see through the cloud in a man's mind to his past and his future. She also possessed the ability to return the dead to life, as evidenced by having brought back Captain Barbossa to help navigate the weird and haunted shores at World's End to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones's Locker. She was also fluent in making zombies, the undead beings who served their master without question. Her charms did not always effect good fortune, although her abilities were unquestionable."],"name":"Tia Dalma","description":"According to one particular legend, Tia Dalma was originally the sea goddess Calypso. Because she too had mortal blood, Calypso fell in love with a sailor named Davy Jones. She gave him the Flying Dutchman and the sacred task of collecting all the poor souls who died at sea, and ferrying them to the worlds beyond. Because of that love, Davy Jones agreed to set foot on land once every ten years, where Jones would be free to come ashore to be with Calypso. But when Davy Jones came ashore after his ten year duty, Calypso was nowhere to be found, for the seas are fickle and unpredictable, as was the powerful goddess who ruled that domain. And so, unbeknownst to Calypso, Davy Jones plotted with the First Brethren Court where they would tear the rule of the seas away from the sea goddess. Jones showed them how to bind her to human form using Pieces of Eight; and thus the Brethren \"captured the Sea Goddess, and bound her in her bones,\" imprisoning her into the body of a mortal woman.\n\nHer binding tamed the seas and satisfied Jones's desire for vengeance. This entrapment could only be reversed if the Brethren Court reassembled, resubmitted the original nine Pieces of Eight they used to bind her, and burned them. Unaware of the crucial role that her former inamorato, Jones, had played in her imprisonment, Calypso would be under the guise of Tia Dalma during her human sojourn.\n\nIt was said that Tia Dalma had been practicing her ways since the waters were tamed. Let it just be stated that several generations fell under her spell and there are many who could tell interesting tales of their relationships with this enchantress. She appeared to be an eccentric, but her skills in the realm of magic were exceptional. By the 1720s, Tia Dalma was already established on the Pantano River in Cuba, and was renowned to be a great voodoo mystic in the Caribbean.\n\nLittle of Tia Dalma's past is known from this point on, save for an association with many pirates and adventurers in the Caribbean. She returned to Jack the eye of Stone-Eyed Sam along with two beads that allowed him to summon the spirit of Montecuhzoma to defeat the phantom Hernán Cortés. Later, during a meeting with the crew of the Barnacle, Dalma professed to have divined something of Sparrow's future, and seemed to be aware that the Chest of Cortés would play a part in his later life. It was during this time that Dalma provided Jack with catnip; the means to return Constance Magliore to her human form, after Dalma herself transformed the girl into a cat. During Jack's quest for the Sun-and-stars amulet, Tia Dalma appeared in the swamps of Louisiana, not far from New Orleans, and spoke with Jack and his crewmember Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III. She advised them to find the golden gem and demanded something that Fitzwilliam lost to be handed over to her as a payment after the adventure.\n\nA few years later, Tia Dalma provided Jack with his compass; a mysterious device that pointed to that which its user truly wanted most.\n\nIn the late 1720s, the Pharaoh Taharka from the mystical island of Kerma visited Tia Dalma in her shack, searching for a cure for his ill son, Prince Aniba. Tia Dalma had the cure, but she demanded a payment, and Taharka went to search for it. Taharka finally obtained the cure, but he was soon killed during the rogue pirate attack. The cure was destroyed, and Aniba died. Around the same time, Tia Dalma met the notorious pirate James Sterling.\n\nIt was thought that Tia and Jack Sparrow became lovers at some point during the latter's adult life\u2014Jack confessed to having \"known\" her at a time when they had been \"inseparable\".\n\nWhen the mysterious Shadow Lord threatened to destroy the Brethren Court with his Shadow Army, Tia Dalma sent her zombie, Alex, to steal the Shadow Gold, a mystical elixir of great power in Shadow Lord's possession. The zombie successfully stole the elixir, but instead of giving all the vials to the greatest Pirate Lord as ordered, he gave almost all of them to almost all of the nine Pirate Lords. Tia Dalma summoned Jack to New Orleans, where she gave him one of the vials and instructed him how to find others. She also ordered Alex to join Jack's crew, so he could deliver Jack Tia's telepathic messages.  At the end of Jack's quest, Tia teleported onboard the Black Pearl, which was sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. She wasn't pleased when she saw that Jack wasted the last vial, and she furiously disappeared, returning to her shack.\n\nAround the late 1740s, the infamous pirate Jolly Roger formed an army of the undead to exact revenge on Jack Sparrow and make himself ruler of the Caribbean. During that conflict, many pirates came to Tia Dalma, seeking help and advice. She provided them with voodoo dolls and other magical talismans, but for a fair payment, though a bit unusual in the eyes of ordinary men.\n\nShortly before the War against piracy, Tia Dalma was visited by Angelica, the daughter of the infamous pirate Blackbeard. Tia Dalma gave her informations about the Profane Ritual, something which Angelica and Blackbeard needed for their search for the legendary Fountain of Youth. In exchange, Angelica gave her a ring which she received some years earlier from Jack Sparrow.\n\nMany years after she and Jack last parted ways, Sparrow returned to Tia Dalma in need of her assistance. Pursued across the Caribbean by the dreaded Kraken, Jack planned to find the Dead Man's Chest, and in doing so taking control of Davy Jones's heart, resting within, and ensuring his control over Jones and his Kraken. Although Tia seemed pleased to see Jack upon his arrival at her shack, she appeared more interested in his companion, William Turner, whose boyish good looks instantly charmed Tia. Jack was shocked when his old sweetheart ignored him and beamed an inviting smile at Will. Tia touched Will's face with her hand. \"You have a touch of destiny about you, William Turner...\" she told him; to Will's amazement, that she knew his name, though they had never met before. Jack, with more than a touch of jealousy wanted to get straight to business.\n\nA series of trades took place. Knowing Tia Dalma demanded payment, Jack Sparrow gave a cage with Jack the \"undead monkey\" trapped inside. Tia opened the cage to release the monkey, who ran toward a pair of boots of his old master, Captain Hector Barbossa. She then told Jack and his crew about Davy Jones, in part, while answering Will's question about Jones' Chest and its key. Having told Jack what he wanted to know, and discovering that Jack was marked with the Black Spot, Tia Dalma gave Jack a jar of dirt, so that he would always carry land, where he'd be safe from Jones. At Will Turner's request, Tia Dalma helped them to know where to find Davy Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman, divined through \"reading\" crab claws. Jack's crew left the shack to continue their search for the Dead Man's Chest, leaving Dalma alone in her shack\u2014or so they believed.\n\nJack's crew would soon return to Tia Dalma's shack, but this time without their Captain. Jack had fallen to the Kraken, going down with his ship as the beast dragged the Black Pearl down to Davy Jones' Locker. Tia had apparently foreseen this eventuality, and informed the mourning crew that there was a chance to save Jack. Their journey would take them to World's End, but, though Tia would be joining them on their quest, they would need the leadership of a Captain who knew the waters of World's End. With that, she introduced the resurrected Barbossa to the stunned crew.\n\nIt appeared that Tia had been responsible, either partly or perhaps completely, for Barbossa's return to the world of the living after Jack shot him in the heart on Isla de Muerta a year earlier. Tia, seemingly more powerful than any of the crew could have guessed, seemed set to lend her mystical aid to the return of Captain Jack Sparrow at World's End.\n\nTia Dalma sailed with the rest of the crew to Singapore and took part in the fight against Lord Cutler Beckett's men. She went with the group as they sailed to Davy Jones' Locker. Her power let her command the crabs there to drag the Black Pearl back to the sea.\n\nAt Shipwreck Island, the Brethren Court decided not to release Calypso from her human form. However, having been able to steal all nine Pieces of Eight, Barbossa decided to do so anyway. As part of an incantation, he burned the Pieces of Eight and, with the assistance of Ragetti, spoke the words, \"Calypso, I release you from your human bonds\" as a lover would. Before Calypso could change into another shape, Will Turner revealed the name of the one who truly betrayed her by telling the First Brethren Court how to bind her: Davy Jones.\n\nEnraged by this knowledge, Calypso began to change; she grew and became several stories tall in a matter of moments. Once she stopped growing, she looked down at the pirates. Barbossa approached and knelt before her. She listened to Barbossa's supplication, then cried out incomprehensibly in a deep voice, \"Malfaiteur en tombeau, crochir l'esplanade, dans l'fond d'l'eau!\", French for \"Across all the seas, find the path to he who wrongfully entombed me!\". Then Calypso appeared to crumble. She dissolved into the form of thousands of small crabs which fell to the deck of the ship, overflowed into the sea, and were gone.\n\nCalypso showed her wrath by summoning a maelstrom and striking the sea with lightning and rain. She also gave \"favorable winds\" to both the pirates and the EITC Armada, thus enticing both sides to do battle. After Davy Jones was defeated, the maelstrom vanished and the weather was calm again.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tia_Dalma"}}

It was here that Ezekiel, along with a number of sailors and pirates, signed on to sail under Jack Sparrow.\n\nClimbing aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Ezekiel worked as one of the ship's deckhands for the next five days, where he would work with a shanghaied Jack Sparrow. He later met with Jack and some of the other crewmen, who were not satisfied with sailing under Angelica and her zombie crew, and took part in Jack's mutiny aboard the Revenge. Jack's crew were soon victorious until Blackbeard himself came out of his cabin. Blackbeard, in response to being told that this was a mutiny, hung all of the crewmen, including Ezekiel, with the rigging of the Queen Anne's Revenge. Ezekiel and the rest of the crewmen were let down to witness the Cook's punishment.\n\nThe Queen Anne's Revenge soon arrived to Whitecap Bay for the hunt for a mermaid, which Blackbeard needed. Ezekiel was put into one of the longboats, along with Scrum, Philip Swift, Gunner, the Cabin Boy, and Derrick. As soon as the bay's lighthouse was lit, shining its man-made light on the crewmen, Ezekiel realized that they were the bait for the mermaids. Cabin Boy asked if sharks would come, but Ezekiel explained that they were the bait for mermaids. When one mermaid, Tamara, appeared to the crew, Ezekiel attempted to kill her, but was stopped by Scrum.\n\nShortly after more mermaids came to the crew, the mermaids attacked the crew. Ezekiel kept the mermaids at bay as they jumped from the water to catch their prey and tear their longboat apart, succeeding at stabbing one through the gut as she lunged at him from the water. After the attack was finished, Blackbeard and the crew was successful in capturing a young mermaid.\n\nLater, Ezekiel joined the crew that accompanied Blackbeard in finding the Fountain of Youth. At the Jungle Pools, Ezekiel was present when Blackbeard and the crew successfully attained a tear from the mermaid, whom Philip Swift named Syrena. The Revenge's crew soon arrived to the Fountain of Youth, where they met Hector Barbossa and his crew, and a battle ensued between the two crews. Ezekiel fought bravely against the British soldiers until the Spaniard and his men arrived to destroy the Fountain.\n\nHector Barbossa was able to fatally wound Blackbead, and then claimed Blackbeard's ship, crew and sword as payment for his missing leg.

He was raised in a devout Christian family and a member of the Church of England. At a young age, he was press-ganged into a service in the British Royal Navy. When his ship docked in Port Royal, Jamaica, Robby deserted and became a cabin boy on a merchant ship bound for England.\n\nOff the coast of Bermuda, Robby's ship was attacked and captured by La Vipère, a pirate ship of Captain Christophe-Julien de Rapièr. Left with no choice but to become a pirate or be killed, Robby joined Christophe's rogue crew. Robby served on La Vipère for the next several years, passing himself off as a ruthless rogue pirate. He fought in battles when he had to, but he mostly stabbed corpses.\n\nOne day, while La Vipère was docked in Shipwreck Cove, the Pirate Lords discovered that Christophe is one of the rogue pirate captains who violated the Code of the Pirate Brethren by attacking other pirate ships. Christophe and his whole crew were imprisoned in the cells of Shipwreck City, but they managed to escape with the help of a young pirate Jack Sparrow, who believed that Christophe is innocent. But Christophe's rogues kidnapped Jack and took him aboard their ship. A few weeks later, after the attack on the Dutch flute, Jack was sentenced to float at sea in a lifeboat with no supplies. Robby escaped with him, bringing him much needed supplies.\n\nAfter this, Greene joined the East India Trading Company with Jack. He sailed as the Second Mate aboard the Fair Wind, a brig of the East India Trading Company, under captain Nathaniel Bainbridge. When he was approximately twenty years old, his ship was attacked by the Venganza, a pirate frigate captained by Esmeralda, the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. Captain Bainbridge was killed during the battle, but the ship's First Mate, Jack Sparrow, managed to persuade pirates to take only one third of the ship's cargo of rum.\n\nAfter that, Sparrow took command of the Fair Wind, and sailed for London. When the ship returned to its home port, Calabar, Africa, Sparrow and Greene gave their report to the local Director of West African Affairs for the EITC, Cutler Beckett. After that meeting, Sparrow was promoted to the rank of a captain, and given command of the Wicked Wench, a merchant vessel of the Company. On Sparrow's request, Robert became his First Mate aboard the Wench.\n\nRobby was aboard the Wench during her first voyage to the Caribbean. He defended the Wench when she was attacked in the Bahamas by the Koldunya, a sloop of the rogue pirate captain and Jack's nemesis Boris Palachnik. After the battle, he and Jack joined Jack's lady friend Esmeralda Maria Consuela Anna de Sevilla in a dinner on her frigate, the Venganza. Robby participated in the search for Zerzura, although he remembered nothing from it, due to the Zerzuran spell placed on the Wench's entire crew.\n\nWhen Jack Sparrow decided to steal the Wench rather than transporting slaves to Penwallow's plantation in New Avalon, Robby agreed to sail with him as a pirate. When they were captured by the EITC after freeing all the slaves in Kerma, Robby was put into a cell aboard one of the EITC ships, the Larkspur, and taken to search for Zerzura, to no prevail. He was then returned to Calabar, where he was held in a prison, in a cell next to Jack Sparrow. It was in there he admitted to Jack he still wanted to return to farm life and marry. Robby also admits that he burried some of his treasure from Zerzura in Calabar that he and Jack can use if they ever escape from prison.\n\nRobby was aboard the EITC ship, the Sentinel, when Cutler Beckett branded Jack Sparrow as a pirate, and ordered the destruction of the Wicked Wench. He and Jack fought their way off the Sentinel, and swam to the Wench, now on fire. After attempting to stop Jack Sparrow from entering his burning ship, Jack ordered him to leave, and follow his dream of returning to farming. Robby obeyed his captain's last order to him and began swimming to shore where he could hopefully find his hidden treasure and start the new life he always wanted.

Along with his young wife, Barbara, Benedict plotted to use the situation with the Shadow Lord as a means of ridding the Seven Seas of piracy forever and advancing their status.","In his youth, Benedict Huntington served as a sailor aboard a merchant ship. He would later join the East India Trading Company and take a beautiful young wife, Barbara, whom he dearly adored. Assisted by Barbara's charm and powers of manipulation, Benedict was able to use his sharp wit to climb the ranks of the EITC, ultimately becoming manager of the Company's Hong Kong branch.","During the Huntingtons' rondevous with Liang Dao, Benedict learned that Mistress Ching and Sao Feng's meeting would be held at the former's opium den in that very city. Gathering a large group of EITC agents, Benedict and Liang Dao headed into Ching's opium shack before she, Feng, Sparrow, Barbossa, and all their crewmates arrived there. After ordering his agents to act like they were smoking from the opium pipes, Benedict hid himself within a blanket on one of the couches in the front room. When the pirates showed up and began their meeting in the room adjacent to the smoking den, Benedict eavesdropped on their discussion, which revolved around himself and the Shadow Lord's threat. When he heard Mistress Ching tell Carolina that all she cared about at the present moment was Benedict Huntington, Benedict decided to make his presence known by loudly announcing that he thought this was very wise of Mistress Ching. When the pirates turned to the outer room to see who had spoken, Benedict got up from the couch and approached them, gleefully announcing his intention to destroy them. At this, Benedict's agents stood up and drew their swords and pistols, and Benedict offered a reward to the agent who killed the most pirates, wanting them all dead before the night was through. He then pointed his pistol at Sao Feng and fired, but Lian and Park threw themselves forward and managed to knock their master out of the bullet's path. As the brawl began, Huntington stood back and observed the fighting with smug satisfaction.","Sometime after the Black Pearl had finally made it to India, Benedict was contacted again by his wife after she managed to sneak off the ship and made her way to Sri Sumbhajee's temple. With the information provided to him by his wife, Benedict was able to guide an entire fleet of EITC ships into the harbor of Sri Sumbhajee's palace. Rapier drawn, Benedict lead his agents in the charge onto land, and as Sri Sumbhajee and his men rushed down to meet them a massive battle ensued. During the fight, Benedict faced off against Carolina on the`dock and came close to killing her, but was thwarted when Jack loosed several stampeding wild elephants into the harbor and his terrified wife began yanking him toward one of the rowboats at the end of the dock. Though Benedict was loath to leave the battle, Barbara insisted they had to go, shoving the oars into Benedict's hands. Back on the Peacock, an enraged Benedict observed the defeat of his men, hopping up and down and shaking his fists in the process.","When Sparrow rushed through the nearest door and turned to close it behind him, Benedict quickly blocked the gap, bellowing for Jack to let him it and not let the beast eat him.. Benedict squished his skeletal frame through the gap, and when Jack reached for a chair to shove against the door handle so the beast couldn't get in, Benedict rushed over to grab the other end and together they braced it against the door. Once it was secure Benedict immediately turned on Jack again, however, and they continued their struggle until the gorilla finally managed to break through into the room and lunged for Huntington. Even though Benedict had just attempted to execute him, Jack couldn't stand to see the man get eaten, so he began attempting to draw the beast's attention onto himself, trying to convince the creature to come after him for food. Before going after Jack, the gorilla lifted one massive paw and backhanded Benedict across the face, knocking him unconscious.","Huntington was known for carrying around a whip-thin rapier as sinister looking as himself.

His smooth blond hair was so pale it was almost white, and his blue eyes were so light they were nearly colorless. Benedict's complexion was so pale people who met him and his wife often wondered whether she had drained all of the color out of her husband upon marrying him. He was partial to wearing entirely white suits and a white woolen cloak, with white stockings and shoes and a wide-brimmed white hat to protect himself from the sun, which he loathed.\n\nHuntington's wealth was so vast he was said to be the envy of every Englishman in Hong Kong. He often relied on his wife to assist him in his manipulation of fellow bureaucrats as a means of advancing career-wise. Where his wife was loud and vivacious, Benedict was typically quiet and calculating. This contrast in personality often served to work in the couple's favor, as many a diplomat would find themselves distracted by Barbara's striking charms, only to discover later that Benedict had taken advantage of the situation to weasel some vital secret out of them without their even noticing it. This cunning ferocity was said to have been what drew Benedict and his wife together despite their outward differences.\n\nBenedict had an intense hatred of pirates, primarily due to the activities of the Asian Pirate Lords in his territory.

A group of pirates led by fellow Pirate Lord Captain Hector Barbossa came for these charts, sending Will Turner to steal them, while simultaneously infiltrating his bath house in Singapore. This almost brought the two groups into conflict with each other until the untimely arrival of Mercer's soldiers of the East India Trading Company. Near the end of the battle, Feng allowed Barbossa's crew to take one of his ships and his charts to Davy Jones' Locker to rescue Jack Sparrow and the Black Pearl. Feng would also join the East India Trading Company until he was betrayed by Lord Cutler Beckett, in which he would rejoin the pirates and agreed to join the Brethren Court the fight against Beckett until he fell to the Flying Dutchman.","The only man he ever risked his life for was Jack Sparrow.

Despite this, among his possessions, Sao Feng held one of the great keys to a true pirate mystery: the charts that showed the way to World's End. Sao Feng also owned one of the nine pieces of eight, as did the other Pirate Lords. His piece of eight was made of silk, from the famous Silk Road which Marco Polo traveled, and jade, a traditional Asian gem. It was known as the jade Captain's knot. He wore it around his neck at all times, and prior to his death, passed it on to Elizabeth Swann, in which it was later destroyed during the freeing of Calypso, along with the other pieces of eight."],"name":"Sao Feng","description":"Nothing is known about Sao Feng's youth except that he was the son of a Chinese Pirate Lord who participated in the Third Brethren Court. When he grew up, he became captain of the Empress, a ship in the pirate fleet of Liang Dao, his older brother who inherited the Piece of Eight from their father and became the new Pirate Lord of Singapore and the South China Sea. Over the years, Sao Feng became one of the fiercest pirates that ever sailed the South China Sea.\n\nIn the early 1730s, Sao Feng was sent by Liang Dao to find the black gem of great value known as the Deep Sea Opal. According to myths and legends, any man who possessed it would earn great fortune, power, and fame. But the legends also told that the opal's power would not go to anyone who steals it, as only those who receive it as a gift would benefit from its glorious effects. The man who was foolhardy enough to steal it, on the other hand, was said to be cursed forever.\n\nDuring the journey, Sao Feng made a plan to obtain the gem for himself and overthrow Liang Dao. Though he didn't believe in the story about the curse, or that there was any power in the opal beyond its value as a precious gem, he knew Liang Dao's pirates would never consider switching allegiance to him if they believed he was a cursed man.\n\nSailing in the waters north of Australia, the Empress encountered the Black Pearl, the ship of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow, the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. The Pearl was anchored not far away from a coral reef, and the Empress anchored nearby. Feng asked Jack what was he doing in his territory, to which Jack's crewmember Alex replied that they were searching for the mystical elixir known as the Shadow Gold.\n\nSao Feng then invited Jack, his First Mate Hector Barbossa, and his crewmember Carolina to his cabin, where he proposed a deal: he'll get Jack the vial of Shadow Gold if Jack steals the Deep Sea Opal. Though Barbossa and Carolina objected, Jack agreed. Sao Feng then told him that the opal was located deep under the sea, down in the watery depths. He also told him that the opal was supposedly guarded by a creature called the Rainbow Serpent. He then informed Jack that his attendant Lian would accompany him to ensure there are no tricks. When Jack, Lian, Billy Turner, and Diego de Leon returned from the sea bottom a few hours later with the opal, the Empress and the Black Pearl sailed for Singapore.\n\nWhen the two pirate ships docked in Singapore, Sao Feng took Jack and his friends to Liang Dao's palace. When they were taken before Liang Dao, the Pirate Lord expressed faux relief that his brother has returned unharmed, but Sao Feng revealed that he intends to use the Deep Sea Opal to claim the throne of the Pirate Lord.\n\nA massive fight began, during which some of Liang Dao's warriors joined Sao Feng, who convinced Jack and his men to fight on his side as well. After the battle, Jack demanded the vial of Shadow Gold which Feng promised him, but the confused Liang Dao revealed that he has no such thing. As Feng took his brother's Piece of Eight, and refused to kill him, telling him to live in disgrace, he told Jack that the Shadow Gold is actually in Hong Kong in the possession of Mistress Ching, the head of the Pirate confederation of China and the Pirate Lord of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Empress and the Black Pearl sailed for Hong Kong, where Jack and his friends had to disguise themselves as agents of the East India Trading Company, because the town was governed by the EITC official Lord Benedict Huntington. When they found Mistress Ching and her men, Sao Feng introduced himself to her as the new Pirate Lord of Singapore.\n\nMistress Ching took them all to her opium den where Ching and Feng immediately began discussing how best to proceed in regards to the problem of Benedict Huntington. Carolina, despite Jack's warning, tried to warn them about the Shadow Lord and his plans. Sao Feng expressed curiosity over Carolina's warnings, but Mistress Ching refused to believe her story, insisting that Benedict Huntington and his men are her only worry. Just then, Benedict Huntington himself steped before them, revealing that almost all men in the opium den are actually EITC agents in disguise. Feng and Ching automatically accused each other of betrayal, but Liang Dao suddenly emerged from amongst the agents, revealing that he was the one who gave their meeting location to Huntington.\n\nA major battle then broke out between the pirates and the EITC agents. During the battle, Huntington tried to shoot Feng with his pistol, but Lian and her sister Park threw themselves forward and managed to knock their master out of the bullet's path. In the end, both Feng's and Sparrow's crews managed to escape from the city.\n\nAs a new Pirate Lord of the South China Sea, Feng resided in a bath house in Singapore, from which he ruled his territory and warriors like an emperor. He also maintained Cheng's Castle, in which was housed a valuable Dragon Tile. His empire, buoyed by a network of spies, had great influence and Feng himself managed a large fleet of junks. Through unknown circumstances, Sao Feng would come into possession of mysterious navigational charts, the map to the Land of the Dead, which he would keep in his uncle's temple.\n\nThe only man Sao Feng ever risked his life for was Jack Sparrow. At some point prior to Jack's death by the Kraken, Sparrow committed an act that insulted Feng deeply, possibly by stealing the hearts of his twin companions, Lian and Park, sparking a grudge between the Pirate Lords that would last years.\n\nFollowing Sparrow's death, Will Turner arrived in Singapore and broke into the temple of Sao Feng's uncle, in an attempt to steal Feng's navigational charts. Will was captured and held at the bath house while Feng awaited the arrival of the would-be thief's allies. They arrived in the form of fellow Pirate Lord Hector Barbossa, and Elizabeth Swann, with whom Feng was immediately taken. However, Feng remained suspicious, especially since soldiers of the East India Trading Company had been seen in the city, forcing his men to travel only through the sewers.\n\nDuring their meeting, Barbossa tried to acquire Feng's navigational charts, and requested a ship and safe passage through Singapore's waters. Feng inquired as to why they wanted his charts in the first place. Barbossa attempted to change the subject by summoning Feng to the Brethren Court, in order to decide what was to be done against the East India Trading Company\u2013\u2013which was systematically exterminating pirates around the world. Feng was hesitant to enter into open war with the East India Trading Company, and so Elizabeth declared Feng a coward, claiming that he was hiding in his bath house while his fellow pirates died. Feng was angered by this remark, but, impressed by Elizabeth's assertiveness, calmed himself and did not retaliate.\n\nFeng instead pointed out that Barbossa had still not said why he wanted his charts. Feng also told them that he thought that it was odd that they would ask for his navigational charts, on the same day they were almost stolen. He then revealed Will Turner, who he had kept in a pool of water, to his guests. Barbossa told Feng that Will was not their ally, but when Feng moved to kill Will, Elizabeth let out a gasp. Feng realized that they had been lying, and asked why they were going to such lengths to acquire his charts. Barbossa and Elizabeth refused to answer, but Will revealed that they needed the charts to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. Remembering how Sparrow had insulted him in the past, Feng became angry, and declared that he wanted Jack to remain dead.\n\nWhen weapons were thrown up through the floorboards to Barbossa and Elizabeth, the meeting became much more tense. Feng noticed an unfamiliar man with a fake tattoo among his soldiers\u2014undoubtedly a spy. Feng seized the man and declared that he would kill him if Barbossa did not drop his weapons. Barbossa, however, encouraged Feng to kill the man, claiming that the spy was not his, and at that moment, the man's real paymasters revealed themselves, and soldiers of the East India Trading Company burst through the doors of the bath house and opened fire on Feng's men. As the skirmish escalated, it transformed into a full-scale battle, which poured out onto the streets of Singapore. Soon after Feng's bodyguards, Lian and Park, were killed by Mercer\u2013\u2013the leader of the contingent of Company soldiers\u2013\u2013Feng ordered a retreat. Feng was then confronted by Will Turner, and offered Feng a deal: Will would hand over a living Jack Sparrow, on whom Feng to carry out his revenge, all in exchange for Feng's promise than when he captured Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl, he would make Will captain. Feng agreed, and handed over his charts to Will, as well as giving Barbossa the Hai Peng and allowing them to leave unharmed. To ensure that Feng could carry out his plans, he sent his second-in-command, Tai Huang, with them.\n\nOnce Barbossa's crew departed, Feng was approached by Mercer, who offered Feng a another deal: Feng would be allowed to take the Black Pearl for himself and would be spared by the East India Trading Company if he handed its crew, specifically Jack Sparrow, over to Lord Cutler Beckett. Feng agreed to arrange an ambush for the Black Pearl and its crew once they returned from the Locker. Feng then left Singapore in the Empress, and set off to wait for the Pearl to return to the Caribbean.\n\nSao Feng intercepted the newly risen Black Pearl off the coast of a small island, signaling for Tai Huang to turn on Barbossa's crew and deliver them to him. His crew then seized the Pearl and handed it over to Will Turner. The HMS Endeavour soon joined them, and Feng handed Jack over to Beckett. Feng found himself on the receiving end of yet another betrayal: Mercer defaulted on his side of their bargain and claimed the Black Pearl for the East India Trading Company. This, along with placating words from Barbossa, convinced Feng to finally join the fight against Beckett and the Company. He agreed to allow Barbossa to escape, if he could return to the Empress with Elizabeth. Feng believed her to be the sea goddess Calypso in human form, and wished to sample her legendary fiery nature for himself. Barbossa and Elizabeth agreed, over Will's protests, and Feng boarded his ship with the supposed \"Calypso\". The Empress launched a broadside on the Endeavour, inadvertently facilitating Jack Sparrow's escape from Lord Beckett. The Empress then sailed across open water, headed for Shipwreck Cove.\n\nOnboard the Empress, Sao Feng had his new twin assistants dress Elizabeth in a stunning silk outfit and held her as his guest in his cabin. Here, he admitted that upon first sight, he believed Elizabeth might be Calypso, and her actions since then had only made him more certain. However, Elizabeth ignored his advances, and struck him in the face. Enticed, Feng forced himself upon Elizabeth, who bit his lip when he attempted to kiss her.\n\nIt was in that moment of chaos that the Empress fell under attack from the Flying Dutchman, flagship of Davy Jones, under the command of Admiral James Norrington\u2013an agent of the East India Trading Company himself. The Dutchman had been sent by Beckett to catch the Empress, and it fired upon Feng's vessel. A cannon ball blasted through Feng's cabin and knocked him back into a piece of wood, impaling him.\n\nElizabeth came to him in time to catch his dying words. Feng, still believing Elizabeth to be Calypso, gave her his piece of eight, the seemingly meaningless monkey fist necklace which marked Feng's pirate lordship of the South China Sea. Feng had thus marked Elizabeth as his heir, and when he died, she inherited the Empress and his title as Pirate Lord. Feng asked Elizabeth to forgive him, calling her \"Calypso\" once more. Elizabeth, now in possession of his piece of eight and his ship, would go on to join the Brethren Court at Shipwreck Cove.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sao_Feng"}}

The rogues butchered even the crews which surrendered without fight. Borya's fleet soon began to spread their attacks on all oceans of the world. The rogue attacks soon forced the Navies of European countries to escort merchant convoys.\n\nA year after the start of his rogue activities, Borya's sloop encountered Hector Barbossa 's schooner, the Cobra, in the waters north of Bermuda. The Cobra was heavily laden with ivory, after the successful attack on the French barque. The crew of the Cobra raised Barbossa's black pirate flag, to which Borya's crew responded by raising their red pirate colors. Though the Pirate Code called all pirates to respect each other, Borya's greed for booty prevailed, and he ordered his men to open fire on the Cobra. The battle between the two pirate ships lasted until sundown, and ended with the sinking of the Cobra. Borya's men killed all survivors they could find in the water, to leave no witnesses. But they didn't know that Barbossa and the few of his man managed to escape from the battlefield in the boat under the cover of the night.\n\nTwo months later, the Koldunya docked in Shipwreck Cove, where Borya participated in the meeting of the Brethren Court with other contemporary pirates - Don Rafael, Dona Esmeralda, Edward Teague, Mistress Ching, Eduardo Villanueva, and Jack Sparrow. The pirate captains at the meeting expressed their dismay over the occurrences of rogue pirates attacking peaceful merchant ships, for the fear of war on piracy being declared by the colonial powers of Europe.\n\nTo Borya's surprise, Hector Barbossa also appeared on the meeting, where he told the story of his own encounter with the rogues. Pretending to be a loyal pirate, Borya proposed to go hunt the rogue vessel with the Koldunya, but Jack Sparrow noticed that there are too many attacks for only one ship to be causing them all. The Pirate Lords agreed to find the rogues and deal with them once and for all.\n\nA few months later, one of Barbossa's men, One Tooth Tommy, saw Borya in Shipwreck City, and recognized him as the captain of the slop that sank the Cobra. Though he hadn't know who Borya is, Tommy talked about his encounter with Jack Sparrow. The same night, Tommy was drowned by Christophe-Julien de Rapièr, one of Borya's rogue captains, who wanted to silence a dangerous witness. Tommy's death alarmed Jack, who started to search for the rogue sloop in Shipwreck Cove. Together with Esmeralda, Jack rowed around the harbor, until he saw the Indian brass bow chaser on the Koldunya. That cannon was the first to open fire on the Cobra.\n\nJack told of his suspicions to Barbossa, who recognized the Koldunya as the ship that sank the Cobra. Captain Teague and Don Rafael joined them on the docks, and they agreed to search Borya's ship. They didn't find Indian bow chaser on Borya's ship, but Teague decided to call for an official court of inquiry. In the Pirate Hall, all the witnesses told their stories, but there was not enough evidences against Borya, and Teague decided to summon Davy Jones, the Lord of the sea. Jones knew everything that happened in his watery kingdoms, and the Brethren Court spoke a magic call that brought Jones onboard the Troubadour, Teague's ship. When asked about Borya's guilt, Jones recognized him as the leader of the rogue pirates, saying that he and his men sent many souls to the sea bottom without mercy.\n\nBorya and his whole crew were quickly imprisoned in the dungeons of Shipwreck City. They were all sentenced by Captain Teague to hang. For unknown reasons, Borya gave his jailers the names of all rogue captains under his command. Thanks to the information, Christophe-Julien de Rapièr was captured while he was trying to flee from the island. The French pirate and his crew were also sentenced to hang.\n\nA day before the execution, Barbossa visited Borya in a prison, where Borya apologized for the destruction of Barbossa's ship. Borya even gave him his most precious token, his Piece of eight, the sign of pirate lordship, thus making Barbossa the next Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea, though Barbossa didn't know the meaning of the Piece of Eight at that time. Borya even offered to give the Koldunya to Barbossa as a payment for the loss of the Cobra.\n\nThe same night, Jack Sparrow, who believed that Christophe is innocent, helped him and his crew to escape from their cells, but Christophe's guilt was proved a moment later, when he freed Borya and his crew too. The rogues escaped to their ships, leaving Shipwreck Island forever.\n\nFor the next five years, Borya continued with rogue piracy, and he remained in the Caribbean, though he was now an outlaw in the eyes of the Brethren. He also wanted to exact revenge on Jack Sparrow, whom he blamed for the downfall of his organization. He even offered to pay anyone who could report the whereabouts. He also learned that Jack has become a merchant captain in the East India Trading Company.\n\nOne day, Borya discovered that Sparrow was back in the Caribbean, so he sailed to one of the most-used routes on the Triangle, to wait for Sparrow's ship.\n\nWhile she was cruising in the Bahamas, the Koldunya encountered Jack Sparrow's ship, the Wicked Wench. After the long chase, the both ships grounded in the shallow waters. But the ships remained in good positions to fire at each other, and they exchanged many broadsides, inflicting heavy casualties among the crews. The victory ultimately came to Sparrow's side, when Amenirdis, a Zerzuran princess onboard the Wench, used her magic to blow up Borya's powder magazine. All the rogues onboard the Koldunya died in the explosion, Borya among them.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Boris_Palachnik"}}

This caused the Heathen Gods to place a curse upon the gold. Almost two centuries after his death, the spirit of Cortés had clashed with the young adventurer Jack Sparrow.","During his mortal life, Hernán Cortés was a corrosive conquistador. His main goal during his conquest of Mexico was how to acquire gold and power. His greed was so great, that even the stone chest filled with 882 pieces of gold wasn't enough for him. During his afterlife, he was a lying, treacherous person who used others to do his bidding. Human lives meant nothing to him, and he was willing to do anything that was necessary to take complete control over the Seven Seas.","As a conquistador, Hernán Cortés was dressed in an armor made of iron and silver. As a ghost, he looked like the living dead, and his breath stank like a barrel of rotten fish. His most prominent weapon was his cursed sword, which he used to crush the Aztecs. Thanks to the powers of the Sword, the Aztecs believed that Cortés was a god in human form."],"name":"Hernán Cortés","description":"Cortés was born in 1485 in the kingdom of Castile in the city of Medellín. His was an upper class family, though his parents weren't wealthy. At the age of 14, his parents sent him to the University of Salamanca to eventually study law. After two years, he returned home, but wasn't satisfied there. As stories began to come in about the mysterious \"New World\", Hernán Cortés wanted to be a part of it.\n\nIn 1504, Cortés boarded a ship commanded by Alonso Quintero, departing for the west. In Hispaniola, Cortés went to the house of the Governor, who he knew from Spain. The Governor convinced him to take a piece of land for a time. He didn't entirely settle down, though. He was involved in the military, suppressing native uprisings.\n\nOver the next few years, Hernán Cortés took part in conquests of Cuba and Hispaniola, and received more land an native slaves as a result. He became an important man in the colony of Cuba, and he became mayor of Santiago. Eventually, he married the sister-in-law of Governor Velázquez, Catalina Xuárez. Dissatisfied with his life, he remained ambitious for more wealth, more slaves, and more adventures.\n\nAt some point before sailing for Mexico, Cortés obtained a magical sword, said to have the power to rule entire kingdoms. Armed with that sword, in 1519, Cortés led the Spanish Army to conquer new lands in the west.\n\nLanding in the Yucatán, Cortes claimed the land for Spain, and began his conquest. Before continuing the journey, he scourged the native population of the peninsula. He wiped out the Xitami tribe, but not before they gave their most precious possession, the Sun-and-stars amulet, to the Mayans, for safekeeping.\n\nTaking his men to Veracruz, Cortés officially ignored the authority of the Governor and claimed to be acting under the direct authority of Emperor Charles V. In reality, he was taking charge of the situation absolutely, and ready to claim the gold and power he had been looking for. The same year, Emperor Charles appointed Cortés as governor of New Spain.\n\nDuring his conquest, Cortés was unstoppable in battle, thanks to the power of his sword. That weapon also convinced the Aztecs that Cortés was the god Quetzalcoatl returned to them in human form. The Aztec Emperor, Montecuhzoma, served as Cortés' subordinate. But soon, Cortés began to dominate the Aztec empire and massacre its people. For his betrayal, Montecuhzoma was stoned to death by his own men.\n\nWith his armies, Cortés wreaked death and destruction upon the Aztecs. At some point, Mexico's Aztec rulers used a stone chest containing 882 identical pieces of Aztec gold to bribe Cortés. The gold was blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon the indigenous tribes of the New World with his armies. Instead of satisfying Cortés, the gold merely fulled his greed, which became so great that he dishonored the payment and continued his bloodshed to gain even more riches.\n\nOver the years, a legend grew that these actions so angered the heathen gods that they placed a curse upon the gold. The curse caused any who so much as took at least one coin from the chest to live forever as the undead, unable to feel the pleasures of the flesh-and-blood world. Their true appearance would only be revealed by the moonlight, eerily transforming into a living, ragged, rotting skeleton. Through unknown circumstances, the cursed treasure of Cortés would end up being buried on Isla de Muerta, and on it the curse remained. Only by returning all gold in total, and a blood debt repaid, could the curse be broken.\n\nIn unknown circumstances, Cortés lost the scabbard of his sword, which led to his downfall. In 1526 he was suspended in his role as Governor of Mexico. He returned to Spain in 1528. In the early 1540s, Cortés won the right to join the emperor in his fight against Algiers. The war was not a good one for Spain, and Cortes himself was nearly drowned. He returned to Spain, neglected and in debt, and finally decided to return to Mexico. He never made it. On December 2, 1547 he died of pleurisy. However, his spirit remained in his sword.\n\nAlmost two centuries after Cortés' death, his cursed sword became the object of a quest undertaken by Jack Sparrow and the crew of the Barnacle. By the end of the quest, the Sword and its scabbard were reunited on Isla Fortuna. After Jack read the Latin incantation found in the coffin of Francois, the Barnacle's crew expected to see the Sword glowing with power. Instead, the phantom of Cortés himself materialized before them. Despite being in the presence of this undead spirit risen from the dead, Jack welcomed the corrosive conquistador in a friendly way.\n\nAt first, the spirit of Cortés was more than willing to teach Jack Sparrow how to use the Sword. The putrid conquistador showed him how to create rivers out of nowhere, and how to levitate the Sword to his hands from the distance. Because of Cortés, the far end of Puerto San Judas' dock was destroyed by Jack during his experiments with the Sword. However, when Jack ordered the sword to make treasure fall from the sky, or to make a fleet for him to command, he wasn't able to do that. Slightly dissapointed with that, Jack provoked Cortés to do something great with the Sword, and the conquistador caused the snow to start falling on the island. Nevertheless, Jack was fascinated with the power of the legendary weapon.\n\nHowever, Cortés allowed Jack to use the Sword's power to achieve his own ends, thus in a way, depriving Jack of his freedom. The presence of Cortés and his sword made Jack's young crewman Tumen very ill, and the crew of the Barnacle retreated to the inn. But Jack Sparrow refused to go with them, wanting to become the absolute master of the Sword's power. Cortés promised to teach Jack how to master the Sword's full power, but only if he brings him the stone eye of Stone-Eyed Sam.\n\nTo ensure Jack succeeds in his mission, Cortés transformed the Barnacle into a grand warship called the Grand Barnacle. With the power of the Sword, Jack easily sailed the ship across the Caribbean. But Cortés was just using Jack to achieve his own goals. His true intention was to take control of the Aztec spirits inside the Stone eye, and with the power of the Sword, make himself ruler of the Seven Seas.\n\nJack Sparrow returned with the Stone eye and the Sword, and then asked Cortés to do what he promised, to teach him to master the Sword so he could heal Tumen. But it was too late, because Tumen died shortly after Jack returned to the island. Cortés then revealed his true intentions to Jack. In response, Jack freed the spirits of the Aztecs from the Stone eye.\n\nThe spirit of the Aztec emperor Montecuhzoma rose from the eye, and after creating the two Swords of Light, attacked Cortés, who was responsible for the destruction of his empire and his death. Cortés attempted to use his Sword to destroy the vengeful Aztec, but the magical powers of Montecuhzoma were too great even for him. After disarming the undead conquistador, Montecuhzoma trapped Cortés and flied with him below the surface of the sea. When Montecuhzoma reappeared, he was alone.\n\nAfter the disappearance of Cortés, Jack Sparrow took the conquistador's Sword and used it to undone everything that would please its former master.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s"}}

As the Age of Piracy nears to a seeming close, Lord Cutler Beckett gained control of the Flying Dutchman, which now roamed the seas, unstoppable, destroying pirate ships without mercy. From aboard his flagship, the Endeavour, Beckett knew that the legendary Brethren Court would make a plan of action against Beckett, the Flying Dutchman, and his Armada. Knowing the Brethren may not be enough to hold back their fearsome tide, Beckett prepared for a final stand following the Battle of Calypso's maelstrom, which, for his bad luck, resulted in his own death.","Like many people of his time, Beckett had nothing against slavery. For him, selling the black Africans as slaves was just another good business. While he was living in Calabar, he owned several slaves, either to keep his house clean, or to drive his expensive carriage. As the EITC Director of West African Affairs, he was in charge of overseeing the sales inventory carried by hundreds of EITC vessels, and the most valuable African EITC cargo were slaves. Though he didn't exactly consider the black people inferior to the whites, and he even admitted that slave trade wasn\u2019t a pleasant business, it was extremely lucrative, which was for him a good enough reason to involve himself in it.","Beckett owned and used a variety of items and weapons during his service in the East India Trading Company. Perhaps most impressive of all, was the world map he had painted in his Port Royal office. A cartographer was employed to make daily changes to the map as ships returned bringing reports of the Company's growing power and influence. Beckett also maintained a large globe in his cabin aboard the HMS Endeavour. Also aboard, were various nautical instruments and toy ships that eerily resembled torture devices, perhaps reflecting the type of control Beckett planned to exert over the world. He owned a golden signet ring which he used to seal letters and important documents. Beckett also possessed a silver-topped walking stick which he used sparingly, but nevertheless used it to emphasize his status. Interestingly enough, Beckett also owned a horse, which he rode into Port Royal upon his arrival in the Caribbean."],"name":"Cutler Beckett","description":"Cutler Beckett was born in a wealthy family in the county of Somersetshire in South England. When he was born, he was a small, sickly baby that no one expected to survive, but he surprised his family by living. He spent his youth on the family's estate of Springhaven. Cutler's father, Jonathan Beckett Sr., was the director of the Beckett Trading Company, one of the top five merchant companies in England.\n\nFrom his earliest years, Cutler Beckett was fascinated with books and learning. Unlike his older brothers, Jonathan Jr. and Bartholomew, who struggled to master enough mathematics to handle accounting, and enough reading and writing to be able to write confidential business letters in a clear hand, Cutler soon evidenced significant aptitude as a scholar. The subjects that fascinated him were numerous: history, geography, and the classics written in their original Greek and Latin.\n\nBy the age of eight, Cutler Beckett was far better student than his classmates, the sons of local nobles. After an ugly incident in which Cutler was brutally beaten by his classmates, his teacher Angus MacFarlin decided to give him private tutoring lessons. MacFarlin, who liked Cutler's imagination, gave him a copy of an interesting book, My Lyfe Amonge the Pyrates, written by Captain J. Ward, a man who was believed to be a pirate himself. Full of stories about the adventures on the high seas, the book sparked young Cutler's interest in treasure and the supernatural. One of Cutler's favorite legends in the book was the legend of Zerzura, the Shining City, located on the island of Kerma. According to Captain Ward's book, the island was hidden from the outside world by the magical fog and inhabited by the descendants of the Kushites who left Egypt and Kush thousands of years earlier.\n\nFor the next few years, Cutler enjoyed in MacFarlin's private lessons, accompanied by his older sister Jane. However, one thing Cutler still couldn't gain, the respect and love from his father Jonathan. His father and his brothers looked at him like an unwanted mouth they have to feed. Only his sister Jane and his sickly mother showed him love. Wanting to make his father proud of himself, young Cutler decided to become a general or an admiral, a man who would be called \"Sir\" one day. He believed that his father would show him some respect if he acquires a title, the one thing no Beckett before ever had.\n\nBy the age of eighteen, Cutler was well educated. He had studied the works of Isaac Newton, and he wanted to become a professor. With his knowledge, he knew he would be accepted at Cambridge or Oxford. But before settling as a professor, he wanted to see the world.\n\nOne day, his father asked him what would he like to do with his life. Knowing that he had a \"head for business\", Cutler responded that he would like to join his brothers in the Beckett Trading Company. But Jonathan Beckett had a different opinion, believing that Cutler would never be suitable for service to King George, and he wanted Cutler to become a clergyman instead, saying that he has made \"an investment\" in a nice vicarage for him.\n\nHowever, Cutler refused his father's offer, knowing that he wouldn't be a good priest, as he didn't believe in God at all. But then Jonathan said to Cutler how his mother is very sick, and that her last wish is to see him settled as a clergyman. When he heard that, Cutler had a burst of rage, accusing his father of infecting his mother with a smallpox after sleeping with dozens of prostitutes on his night outs. After saying to his father that he despises him, Cutler decided to leave his family's home the same day. Jane heard Cutler's conversation with their father, and though she couldn't come with him immediately, she gave him her entire life savings, so he could send for her once he's settled.\n\nAfter packing his bags, young Cutler headed for London, where he found employment in the East India Trading Company. Cutler worked at the London EITC Office for several months, proving himself to be a good executive. One day, Cutler's superiors assigned him to a tour of duty at the EITC office on Gibraltar. He quickly boarded the merchantman Lindesfarne in London, hoping to finally fulfill his ambition of seeing the world.\n\nHowever, during the journey, off the coast of Spain, the Lindesfarne was captured by the pirate ship Le Requin, captained by the Frenchman Christophe-Julien de Rapièr. Cutler unwisely angered the pirate captain, telling him that his fancy clothes are out-fashioned both in London and Paris. The pirate captain allowed his crew to \"play\" with the youngster, and they tortured him for days. While waiting for the ransom money, the pirate crew forced Cutler and other prisoners to clean their ship; whipping them if they didn't do their work well. Still furious at his son, Jonathan Beckett Sr. refused to pay the ransom, but the EITC official Reginald Marmaduke Bracegirdle-Penwallow sent a ransom for Cutler, and Captain de Rapièr freed the young boy. The experience in captivity left Cutler with eternal hatred for pirates.\n\nWhen he reached Gibraltar, the first thing Cutler Beckett did was writing a letter to the EITC official, Lord Penwallow, thanking him for the EITC\u2019s faith in him, and promising to pay back the ransom amount. After his return to England, Beckett continued to work for the Company. For some time, Beckett worked at the EITC office in Bristol. Over the years, Beckett rose rapidly through the EITC ranks, and he was sent to the Far East to work for the EITC branch in Nippon at the port of Edo.\n\nFor all these years, Cutler stayed in contact with his sister. Now that he was well established, he wanted her to join him, but he couldn't ask her to travel to the other side of the world, a voyage that would take at least six months. When he learned from Jane that their mother is dead, he promised her that she could join him at his next posting.\n\nOver the years, Beckett employed many operatives, men in important foreign ports who kept an eye on developments and reported to him. He had a web of spies funneling him information at all times. A man named Gates, a former spy for the British Crown, served as Beckett's eyes and ears in the seamier sections of Edo. More than a few of Gates' assignments involved violence, either covert or overt.\n\nAfter working for three years in Nippon, Beckett was relocated to Calabar in West Africa, where he became the Director of West African Affairs for the East India Trading Company. When he came to Calabar, Beckett immediately hired Ian Mercer, a professional spy and a killer for hire, to replace his previous operative, Gates, who was killed on a mission in Nippon.\n\nImmediately after he arrived at his new post, Beckett received a letter from his cousin Susan in which she informed him that his sister had died from a fever. Coldhearted as he became, he didn't mourn her death, because he had more important things to do. He was already rich and powerful, and the only thing he wanted now was a title, so he could briefly come to Somersetshire, see his father, and then give him the \u201Ccut direct,\u201D the worst insult high society allows.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take Beckett long to adjust to the demands of his new job, and to ensconce himself in the European community that was growing in Calabar. Soon, Beckett involved himself in a brisk side business in light-skinned female concubines for a few of the wealthy and powerful gentlemen in Calabar. He also did \u201Cfavors\u201D for powerful men, asking for no payment. He knew that having wealthy, powerful men that owed him, that required his discretion and continuing silence, often paid off in many ways.\n\nA few months after he arrived to his new post, Beckett was visited by his immediate supervisor, the EITC\u2019s Director of African Affairs, Viscount, Lord Reginald Marmaduke Bracegirdle-Penwallow. For the next ten days, Lord Penwallow stayed in Calabar as Beckett's personal guest. During that time, Penwallow told him of his contacts at the Court of King George II and the EITC top management. When Lord Penwallow finally departed, Beckett knew that Penwallow might be his ticket to a title.\n\nAt some point during his directorship, Beckett bought an old ship, the Wicked Wench. Though he wanted to use her as a slave ship at first, the shipwrights told him that converting her hold to haul slaves would be expensive, so he decided to use her for hauling other cargos.\n\nOne day, when the EITC brig Fair Wind arrived at Calabar, Beckett was visited by the ship's first and second mate, Jack Sparrow and Robert Greene, instead of the ship's captain, Nathaniel Bainbridge. The officers told him that the Fair Wind was attacked by the pirate frigate Venganza in the Caribbean, and that the captain died from an apoplexy when he tried to attack the pirate captain, a woman called Doña Pirata, because he couldn't stand the idea of a woman commanding a ship. Sparrow and Greene also told him that Jack parleyed with Doña Pirata and that she agreed to take only one third of the ship's cargo of rum.\n\nOne day later, after Beckett examined the logbook of the Fair Wind, he invited Sparrow back to his office. Clearly impressed with Sparrow's negotiation skills, Beckett offered him a promotion to the rank of captain, as well as a vessel to command, the brand-new square-rigger named Marlin. Though Sparrow agreed at first, he said no when Beckett told him that the Marlin would be used as a slave ship. Though Beckett agreed that slave trade wasn't a pleasant business, it was extremely lucrative, and he was very surprised with Jack's refusal. However, knowing that Sparrow could be an excellent operative for him in foreign ports, he decided to indulge him, and offered him command of the Wicked Wench, which Sparrow accepted. A few days later, since the Wench needed repairs, Beckett gave Sparrow some funds and allowed him to install two additional twelve-pound cannons, because the ship was woefully under-gunned. Two weeks later, with her cargo hold full, the Wench sailed for the Caribbean.\n\nOne day, when the EITC merchant captain informed Beckett about the illegal activities of the EITC's portmaster, Benjamin Blount, Beckett sent Mercer with a group of EITC soldiers to arrest the greedy official. But Blount escaped to the interior of the continent, and was never seen again.\n\nA few months later, Beckett was again visited by Lord Penwallow. By luck, the Wicked Wench docked at Calabar the same day, returning from her first voyage as an EITC ship, and Beckett sent Ian Mercer to bring Jack Sparrow to his house for a lunch with him and Lord Penwallow. He even instructed his housekeeper, Mistress Goodwright, to make sure that Jack baths, for which Beckett provided his own bathtub. He also ordered new, fancy clothes for Jack.\n\nWhen Jack finally joined Beckett and Lord Penwallow in Beckett's library, they tasked him with transporting some building materials for Lord Penwallow's new plantation house on the island of New Avalon in the Bahamas. During the lunch, it was clear to Beckett's observant eyes that Sparrow had never dined in that style before, but he easily copied Beckett's impeccable table manners, looking more like a gentleman than Lord Penwallow.\n\nSome time after Sparrow departed, Beckett was glad that Lord Penwallow was now even more pleased with his work, and, especially Beckett\u2019s assistance in the matter of his new plantation. Beckett knew it was only a matter of time before the older man would express his gratitude by sponsoring Beckett in his quest for a title.\n\nSoon, Mercer discovered that Jack Sparrow sailed from Calabar with Benjamin Blount's runaway slave Chamba aboard his ship. He informed Beckett of his discovery, but that only convinced Beckett how clever and audacious Jack is and how good an agent he could be for him.\n\nOne of Beckett's hobbies was collecting antique artifacts belonging to past civilizations. When he sent Mercer to search for such artifacts, the assistant returned with the Portuguese who sold stolen goods. Among his merchandise, there were several pieces of gold jewelry of ancient design which Beckett recognized as Kushite. But the jewelry was also extremely similar to the illustrations in the My Lyfe Amonge the Pyrates book. And most importantly, this jewelry wasn't ancient, causing Beckett to realize that the legends about the island of Kerma and the Shining City of Zerzura were true. He immediately bought all the jewelry from the trader, but the Portuguese had to tell him how he got it. When the Portuguese told him that he bought the jewelry from the slave trader known as Ancona Wren-John, Beckett sent Mercer to find that man.\n\nWhen Mercer found Wren-John, Beckett questioned him about the jewelry. He told them that he found it on some slaves he captured in the interior of Africa. Believing that those slaves came from the island of Kerma, Beckett sent Mercer to find as many slaves from that caravan as possible, and he was able to locate the two of them, an old holy man named Piye and the extremely ugly woman named Ayisha, who was working as a seamstress in the household of Roger Dalton. Though Dalton refused to sell Ayisha when Mercer came to buy her, he agreed when Beckett personally offered him a large amount of money.\n\nWhen Mercer began to interrogate Piye, the old man died with no apparent reason. Afraid that Ayisha could suffer a similar fate, Beckett didn't allow Mercer to interrogate her. And even without using force on her, they couldn't make her tell them anything useful, because she couldn't speak English, and she looked to be half-witted. Instead, they decided to wait for the return of Jack Sparrow, a man who could seduce her and convince her to give them the bearings of Kerma.\n\nWhen the Wench returned to Calabar, Beckett again sent Mercer to bring Jack Sparrow to his office. When Sparrow came, Beckett showed him the jewelry he bought and the illustrations in Captain Ward's book. Sparrow instantly recognized the jewelry as Kerman and, like Beckett, noticed that it wasn't ancient. Beckett then told him about the old priest who died and the ugly seamstress Ayisha. When Jack asked about what Beckett wants him to do, Beckett told him that he should charm Ayisha into telling them where Kerma is. Jack would pretend to help her escape from slavery, take her onboard the Wicked Wench, and when he verifies that the bearings of the island are correct, he would return to Calabar and Beckett would send his fleet to conquer Kerma. In exchange for the bearings of Kerma, Beckett offered him ten percent of the gold that he expected to find on the island. And according to legends, the labyrinth beneath Zerzura was full of ancient Egyptian treasure.\n\nHowever, Jack wanted more than just ten percent, and Beckett than offered him twenty percent of the gold, and ten percent of the slave revenue, because he intended to imprison all Kermans and sell them as slaves. However, Jack refused to involve himself in slave trade, and Beckett finally agreed to give him thirty percent of the gold. Just to make sure that Sparrow would return, Beckett warned him that if he doesn't fulfill their agreement, and fails to return with both Ayisha and the Wench, which were both Beckett's property, he would be considered a pirate.\n\nThough he believed that Sparrow would return, Beckett ordered Mercer to plant a spy aboard the Wicked Wench. Mercer then hired the carpenter Samuel Newton and sent him to join Sparrow's crew. A few days later, the Wench departed with Ayisha onboard. When Mercer informed Beckett that another, apparently Kerman slave from Wren-John's caravan managed to escape from Roger Dalton's farm the same night when the Wench sailed from Calabar, they assumed that the slave was also onboard the Wench.\n\nWhile they waited for Sparrow's return, Beckett and Mercer began to organize a private army with which they intended to conquer Kerma. Mercer managed to recruit two hundred mercenaries in Europe, including former soldiers and pardoned criminals, while Beckett sent a company of one hundred EITC soldiers to join the expedition. Beckett also assembled a fleet of five ships, both the EITC defense ships and merchant vessels that would transport his army to the legendary island. He also intended to use the Wicked Wench in this expedition, completely forgetting his earlier promise to Jack that his ship won't be used in the attack on Kerma.\n\nSome time after Sparrow's departure, Beckett received a letter from Lord Penwallow in which he asked him to buy and send 200 hundred slaves for his new plantation on the island of New Avalon in the Bahamas. He also asked him to give the task of transporting them across the ocean to Captain Sparrow, because he was pleased with the young captain's earlier work on transporting the building materials to the same island. Though he didn't promise anything, Penwallow was sure that Beckett would soon receive some official recognition of his contribution to the Company and the King, because the last time Penwallow was at the Royal Court, he spoke well of Beckett, and he was sure his friends at the Court would like to introduce him to King George II so Beckett could be properly awarded.\n\nA few months later, the Wicked Wench returned to Calabar, with half of her cargo destroyed, and neither Ayisha nor another slave were onboard. The story that Sparrow gave to Beckett was hardly believable. According to Sparrow, Ayisha refused to lead Jack to Kerma before he frees her brother from slavery in the Bahamas. When they accomplished that, the Wench was attacked by the rogue pirates and heavily damaged before the pirate ship exploded. The Wench was saved from sinking by another pirate ship, the same ship that attacked the Fair Wind a year earlier. Thanks to Doña Pirata, the pirates didn't take the Wench's cargo of sugar, and they even escorted her to Savannah. After many expensive repairs, the Wench sailed across the ocean, but when she approached the coordinates that Ayisha gave to Jack, there was only a large fogbank at that location. And when the ship approached the fogbank, the entire crew fell asleep, and when they woke up, Ayisha and other two Kermans were gone, along with one of the ship's longboats.\n\nHowever, Beckett wasn't ready to believe such a story, and he knew that Jack was lying about something. So he decided to interview the entire crew of the Wicked Wench. A few days later, the results of his investigation were equal to null. Though Samuel Newton confirmed to Ian Mercer that Sparrow\u2019s behavior was secretive on some occasions, Sparrow\u2019s account of the voyage was correct. All accounts of interviewed crewmen agreed with Sparrow\u2019s report. Some crewmembers even reported that Sparrow fought against and killed a revenant, a ghost, after the disappearance of three Kermans.\n\nWhen Beckett invited Jack back to his office, he asked him to explain this story about him dueling a ghost, and Sparrow told him that the ghost was his old fencing master from Marseilles, who died before Jack could pay his bill. Jack even showed him scars from the duel, but Beckett still knew that Jack was hiding something. Determined to make Jack pay for what he did, and knowing how much he hates slavery, Beckett told him that Lord Penwallow needs 200 slaves to be transported to New Avalon. As there was no other EITC ship available at the moment, the Wicked Wench would have to be used for that task. Jack then attempted to resign his position as an EITC captain, but Beckett warned him that if he refuses to take a rightfully assigned cargo, and even if he resigns his position, he would owe the Company the money for the destroyed cargo of sugar. Knowing well that Jack couldn't pay such a great sum, he knew what Sparrow's answer would be. Beckett also told him that if he makes this one trip for him, he would never ask him to do it again, and he would even sell him the Wicked Wench for just one shilling. Submitting to Beckett's will, Sparrow agreed.\n\nA few days later, the Wicked Wench's cargo hold was refitted to carry slaves. Beckett personally sent a group of slave handlers onboard to take care of the Wench's human cargo during the journey, and the Wench sailed for the New World. However, Beckett believed that Jack could do something other than he ordered him, so he sent his fleet to secretly follow the Wench. He instructed the captains to attack and capture the Wench if she comes anywhere near the bearings of that fogbank where the three Kermans disappeared.\n\nA few weeks later, Beckett's fleet did exactly that. The Wench's crew surrendered without a fight. However, when the EITC soldiers boarded the Wench, the slaves were no longer onboard. Sparrow was locked in the brig aboard the Sentinel, the EITC\u2019s patrol and defensive vessel for West Africa, which immediately sailed south, back to Calabar, where Jack was thrown into a local EITC jail. The remaining ships continued their search for Kerma near the location where the Wench was captured, but they couldn't find the slightest sign of the island. However, Jack's captain's cabin was searched, and Beckett's men discovered several hiding places full of Kerman gold and gemstones.\n\nExactly thirty four days after the capture of the Wench, Beckett received a letter from Lord Penwallow, in which his patron chastened him for not delivering his cargo. Knowing that his chance at a title was now ruined, Beckett decided to punish Jack by destroying what he loves most\u2014his ship. He believed that it was worth loosing one old ship just to see Jack suffer. The next day, Sparrow and his first mate Robert Greene were brought onboard the Sentinel, which sailed for the place where the Wench was anchored, a few miles from Calabar.\n\nWhen the Setinel approached the Wench, Sparrow and Greene were brought onto the weather deck so they could see what punishment Beckett had in store for Jack. When Ian Mercer took the burning iron rod with a \"P\" symbol, Beckett took it from him, because he wanted to personally do that. He branded Jack as a pirate\u2014burning a \"P\" symbol onto his right forearm\u2014condemning him to spend the rest of his life as an outlaw. When that procedure was done, it was time for Jack's real punishment to begin. Beckett then told Mercer to order his men to open fire on the Wench, and to use the carcass charges, which would start the fire that would consume the Wench and sink her.\n\nSeeing the cannons firing at his beloved Wench, Jack managed to free himself from Mercer's men. Cutler Beckett took a cutlass and tried to stop him, but Jack knocked the weapon out of his hand, grabbed him by the collar, and threw him overboard. Both Sparrow and Greene jumped overboard, and while Greene started swimming toward the shore, Jack was determined to reach the burning Wench and try to save her. When Beckett climbed back onboard the Sentinel, he could watch the Wench burning and sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic. Beckett and his men believed that Jack Sparrow had gone down with his ship.\n\nMarked by his failure to deliver to Lord Penwallow the promised cargo, Cutler Beckett's quest for a title was now seriously slowed down. But despite this temporary setback, he continued to serve the Company as before, because he wasn't a man who would give up so easily. Some time later, while he was in England, he met Weatherby Swann, the good friend of King George II.\n\nAfter years of hard work, Beckett rose through the high ranks of the Company and was made Governor of the Company by the Court of Directors. Soon, he was both knighted and made a lord, eventually becoming the duly appointed representative of King George II. Lord Beckett quickly made use of his newfound power and status to act on his long-standing prejudice against pirates. And knowing that the removal of piracy from the world forever would require having complete control of the Seven Seas, Beckett began the search for the Dead Man's Chest, which contained the still beating heart of Davy Jones, the supernatural Lord of the sea and captain of the legendary ghost ship called the Flying Dutchman.\n\nAt some point during his search, Beckett discovered that Jack Sparrow is alive and in command of the resurrected Wicked Wench, the Black Pearl, as she was called now. He also learned that Jack is in possession of a magical compass that points to what its owner wants most, and that he searched for the cursed treasure of Hernán Cortés that was hidden on Isla de Muerta.\n\nWhen he arrived in the Caribbean, Beckett discovered that the Company isn't the only force which wants to control the New World. The undead army of Jolly Roger, an undead pirate captain, was attacking the main islands in the Caribbean, and the ships on the high seas, both the British and the pirate ships. Not wanting to fight on two fronts at the same time, Beckett made a deal with Roger, because they had a common goal, to rid the world of Jack Sparrow. But when Beckett learned about the magical Lost Weapons of El Patron, a Spanish conquistador who disappeared on a mysterious island called Raven's Cove, he double-crossed Roger and sent the Black Guard to find the weapons. Both Roger's and Beckett forces landed on Raven's Cove, and fought a bloody battle over the weapons. At the end of the fight, both sides retrieved some of the weapons, and Raven's Cove was in ruins.\n\nApproximately a year after the incident at Isla de Muerta, Lord Cutler Beckett was sent to Port Royal with the blessing of the Crown and the official appointment to the Royal Commission for Antilles Trade and Protection, which gave him extraordinary powers both governmental and military. Lord Beckett arrived aboard the HMS Endeavour, bearing arrest warrants for William Turner, Elizabeth Swann and former commodore James Norrington, all of whom had been implicit in Jack Sparrow's escape from Fort Charles. However, months prior to Beckett's arrival, Norrington had resigned his commission, after his failed attempt to capture Sparrow, but Beckett was able to have Elizabeth and William arrested.\n\nDespite the objections of his old acquaintance, Governor Weatherby Swann, Beckett arrested both Will and Elizabeth on their wedding day while accompanied by a troop of East India Trading Company militiamen. However, despite Elizabeth being imprisoned, Beckett struck a deal with Turner; he wished to obtain Jack Sparrow's compass, with which he hoped to find the Dead Man's Chest, which contained the heart of Davy Jones. With the heart he would be able to assume control over Jones and the crew of the Flying Dutchman, and thus the Seven Seas. In return, Beckett promised to pardon Will and make Jack a privateer under the employ of the British crown, with the use of letters of Marque signed by King George II. Will agreed, and set off to locate Jack.\n\nSome time later, Beckett was tipped off that Governor Swann was sending Elizabeth back to London. Realizing that Elizabeth was the only thing holding Will to their bargain, Beckett sent Mercer to kill the captain of the vessel that was to transport Elizabeth to England, and to ambush the governor. While this was going on, Beckett was confronted in his office by Elizabeth, who had snuck away from her father prior to the ambush, and stole the letters of Marque from Beckett's desk. Held at gunpoint Beckett was forced to sign and legitimize the letters for Elizabeth and watch her escape. He anticipated Elizabeth's movements, and sent Mercer to head her off at her most likely destination: the pirate port of Tortuga.\n\nShortly after Elizabeth left, Beckett's men captured a notorious French pirate, Capitaine Chevalle. Beckett had Chevalle tried and set him in stockades in the middle of Fort Charles. Before Chevalle's hanging could commence however, Jack Sparrow snuck into Port Royal to set him free. Sparrow sabotaged the hangman's rope, and then used a series of explosions to cover his and Chevalle's escape from the fort. Unable to recapture Chevalle or Sparrow, Beckett returned to his search for the Dead Man's Chest.\n\nBeckett later had Governor Weatherby Swann brought in to hear Mercer's report that Elizabeth had left Tortuga with Jack Sparrow on the Black Pearl, along with James Norrington. Beckett told Swann\u2014who had been imprisoned for his actions\u2014that his armada would soon catch the Pearl and dispense justice. Swann, ignorant of the fact that the Black Pearl was almost uncatchable, accepted Beckett's demands for his loyalty, in return for Elizabeth's safety.\n\nUltimately, Lord Beckett received the contents of the Dead Man's Chest from James Norrington. Norrington had stolen Jack Sparrow's letters of Marque, who in turn, had taken them from Elizabeth. Seeking to regain his honour, Norrington fought for the heart of Davy Jones with Jack Sparrow and William Turner, and was able to escape from Isla Cruces, and was picked up by a Company ship. With both the letters and the heart, Beckett not only pardoned Norrington, but promoted him to the rank of admiral. With the heart of Davy Jones in his possession, Beckett was now one step closer to his goal of eradicating piracy from the seas forever.\n\nWith the heart in his possession, Beckett employed Admiral James Norrington, and used Davy Jones to hunt down, capture and exterminate piracy from the Caribbean. During this period, in order to catch and execute pirates and their accomplices more quickly, Beckett declared martial law as the duly appointed representative of His Majesty the King. He suspended many rights of ordinary citizens, including the right to a verdict of a jury of peers, the right to legal counsel, the right to gather in protest and several others. Using the authority of Governor Swann, Beckett oversaw the executions of hundreds of people who he believed had even the remotest association with piracy, including children. During one execution, Beckett was able to get the crowd to sing the anthem of the Brethren Court\u2013\u2013a clandestine association of notorious pirates\u2013\u2013a sign he knew would force the Brethren to meet, at which time he could attack and eliminate them with one fell stroke.\n\nAs this war progressed, Beckett was intent on finding the crew of the Black Pearl. He apparently was able to have them tracked to Singapore, where Mercer led a detachment of Company troops to find the hideout of the infamous Chinese pirate, Sao Feng. Beckett had placed a spy in Sao Feng's organization, named Steng, who was able to lead Mercer to Feng's bath house. Mercer ambushed the pirates, but wasn't able to capture Feng, or the crew of the Pearl. Mercer reported that Steng had said that the pirates were gathering, and that nine Pirate Lords would be attending, including Jack Sparrow, who was being rescued by his crew from Davy Jones' Locker. Beckett still desired to know the significance of the nine pieces of eight, of which their spy knew very little. However, Mercer told Beckett of a secret deal he made with Sao Feng: Feng would capture the crew of the Pearl and Sparrow would be delivered to Beckett for interrogation, and in turn Feng would be given the Pearl, a clause Beckett had no intention of fulfilling.\n\nWith the Flying Dutchman under its command, the Company easily obliterated numerous pirate vessels. However, Beckett soon became irritated with Davy Jones' habit of leaving no survivors for him to interrogate. Beckett already forced Jones to beach the Kraken, so that it could not be used against him; now he would need to keep Davy Jones within an arm's reach. Beckett placed Admiral Norrington onboard the Dutchman with the Dead Man's Chest, with mini-cannons pointed at the chest at all times. With the chest in constant danger, Jones was forced to obey Beckett's commands to the letter. Soon after that, Beckett ordered Governor Swann to be murdered, fearing that he would soon figure out the significance of the chest, and pose a threat to his plans. However, Beckett attempted to keep the matter secret, and informed individuals, such as Swann's associate Admiral Norrington, that the Governor had been \"sent back to England\".\n\nAfter the Pearl came back from the Locker, Sao Feng made true to his bargain, and captured the Pearl, through a deal he made with Will Turner. He then defaulted on his deal with Turner, in favor of his deal with Beckett. Beckett then intercepted Sao Feng and the Pearl in his flagship, the HMS Endeavour.\n\nBeckett tried to gain information from Sparrow, while interrogating him in his quarters, but Sparrow's inordinate terms reminded Beckett of Sparrow's compass, the use of which would render Sparrow unnecessary. Sparrow, however, pointed out that since Beckett wanted Sparrow dead more than anything in the world, Jack's compass would only lead to Sparrow. When Beckett suggested killing Sparrow to \"cut out the middle man\", Sparrow pointed out that if Beckett simply killed him, he would then find the meeting place of the Brethren Court, Shipwreck Cove, but he would have to blockade the island and spend countless resources in the process. Sparrow proposed that Beckett release him, so that he could lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove, and draw the pirates out.\n\nBeckett agreed, but at that same moment, Sao Feng joined forces with Hector Barbossa\u2014after learning that he would not be receiving the Pearl after all\u2014and attacked the Endeavour. Sparrow ran out of Beckett's office and cleverly used a cannon and a rope to get back onto the Pearl. Beckett ordered Jones to pursue Sao Feng's ship, the Empress, so that the Endeavour could follow the Pearl. The Endeavour was unable to pursue the Pearl at first, however, due to the fact that during his escape, Jack Sparrow had disabled the main mast of the Endeavour, crippling the vessel for several hours.\n\nWhen repairs had been made, the Endeavour headed off in the general direction of the Pearl, hoping to catch up to Sparrow. Interestingly enough, a trail of bodies tied to barrels was leading them closer to the Pearl. One night, a barrel had a living body on top of it. When pulled to the deck, Beckett came face to face with the man who had made the trail of bodies in the first place, Will Turner. Will had been thrown overboard by Sparrow, and had come to treat with Beckett. As he had tea with Turner, Davy Jones was summoned. Jones was upset with Beckett for not telling him that Sparrow had been freed from the Locker and suspected that he was hiding other information from him as well. Beckett ignored Jones' suspicions, and instead questioned Jones about Calypso, the goddess of the sea, according to nautical legend. Beckett had been told that the pirates possessed Calypso, and he wanted to see if Jones knew anything about her, knowing that, as Jones had sailed the seas for hundreds of years, he would no doubt have heard the \"legend\". Beckett was surprised to find that Jones himself had made a deal with the original Brethren Court to bind Calypso in human form. Will then told them that the Brethren Court intended to release her, and offered to lead Beckett and Jones to Shipwreck Cove, all in return for his father's freedom and the guarantee of his and Elizabeth's safety. Beckett agreed, and Will gave Beckett Jack's compass, which was able to lead him to Shipwreck Cove.\n\nPrior to his arrival at Shipwreck Island, Beckett sent a small force of Company soldiers, under the command of his elite Black Coat soldiers, to attack the Pirate Lords in Shipwreck City. Inevitably, the small contingent of Company troops was defeated, but Beckett had only meant to delay the pirates from escaping, while he organized his armada against them.\n\nTrue to his word, Sparrow had indeed led the Brethren out of their fortress, and offshore of Shipwreck Island, Beckett's armada came face to face with the fleet of the Brethren Court. The pirates were outnumbered ten to one, and Beckett was as confident as ever of his victory. He rowed over to a sandbar in between the two fleets, along with Davy Jones and Will. The three men waited for the arrival of the Court's ambassadors. Finally, Elizabeth Swann, Hector Barbossa and Jack Sparrow strode up the sandbar to them. Beckett told them that they could either surrender or fight, and in the latter case they would all die. Elizabeth rebuked Beckett, and seemed confident in the capabilities of her own small fleet. Although Will told Elizabeth he was the one who had lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove, Beckett was convinced that Sparrow was really behind it all. Beckett revealed to the pirates the deal he had made with Jack, and tried unsuccessfully to get him to confess. Nevertheless, Elizabeth offered to trade Jack for Will, to which Beckett happily agreed. Beckett rowed back to the Endeavour, and ordered his men to ready the fleet.\n\nAs preparations were being made for the battle, an odd wind began to blow in the favorable direction of the pirate fleet, and the skies darkened and rain began to fall. As lightning struck the surface of the water in front of Beckett's fleet, a colossal maelstrom began to form. Beckett saw that the Pearl was heading towards the maelstrom, and ordered the Dutchman to do the same, signaling it to attack the Pearl and to give no quarter. Confident of his superiority, Beckett sent only the Flying Dutchman to attack the pirates.\n\nFollowing the end of the battle of the maelstrom, and the apparent sinking of the Flying Dutchman, the Black Pearl emerged victorious from the massive whirlpool.\n\nAfter Lieutenant Groves saw the Pearl just waiting between the two fleets, Beckett, a little bit worried that his advantage is lost, commanded the Endeavour to finish the Pearl off, disregarding his deal with Sparrow. However, as he closed in on the Pearl, the Flying Dutchman reemerged from the depths. Beckett did not know that Will Turner had stabbed the heart of Davy Jones, and had taken his place as captain of the Flying Dutchman.\n\nAs the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman rounded about and closed in on the HMS Endeavour, Beckett was paralyzed with a mixture of fear, shock, doubt, and indecision, unable to give any of his men a single order. Lieutenant Groves was concerned about what Beckett's orders were in the turn of events. The Pearl and the Dutchman flanked the Endeavour on both sides, and fired a full broadside. Beckett still did not give an order, so Groves ordered the entire crew of the Endeavour to abandon ship, and then jumped overboard. While Beckett still stood in shock, knowing that he will meet his end, the crew of the Endeavour either jumped overboard or were killed in the blasts.\n\nBeckett, defeated and utterly helpless, calmly walked down the staircase from the helm to the quarterdeck of the Endeavour as the ship was being obliterated all around him. Oddly enough, as he walked towards the center of his ship, not a single large piece of metal or wood hit him. But finally, Beckett's life ended when the constant barrage of fire from the two ships ignited the Endeavour's powder magazine, sending his ship up in flames. His body was blown overboard and landed atop a floating East India Trading Company flag.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Cutler_Beckett"}}

Daughter of the Atlas, she was described as a woman as changing, harsh, and untamable as the sea. As a heathen goddess, Calypso was able to take many forms. But since the crab was attributed as her symbol, most notably by pirates, she chose that form. Of Calypso's beauty and power, all sailors were in awe. Her womanliness was unsurpassed in grace and bearing. She was as changeable and whimsical as the sea itself, and exemplified the deepest charity and brilliance of woman's mercurial nature. Calypo's powers were only eclipsed by the great god of the sea Poseidon himself, and only Zeus, chief amongst all gods, could command her.\n\nAs with all beings of great might, she was both a nurturer and a destroyer. Calypso had dominion over all the seas, and all sailors everywhere both loved and feared her. Nevertheless, she was the protector of all sailors. It was she who sent forth the Flying Dutchman to rescue souls lost at sea. Calypso also designed a special metal chamber in which the mermaids locked the magical gems of Poseidon, thus making themselves immune to the power of the Trident of Poseidon.\n\nDespite being harsh and untameable as the wine-dark seas, Calypso fell in love with a young sailor named Davy Jones. And she rewarded that love by giving Davy Jones the Flying Dutchman, charging him with the sacred task of collecting all the poor souls who died at sea and ferrying them to the worlds beyond. Because of that love, Davy Jones agreed to set foot on dry land once every ten years to be with Calypso. True to his word, Jones spent the next ten years faithfully carrying out the duty. But whenever Davy Jones came ashore, Calypso was nowhere to be found, for the seas are fickle and unpredictable, as was the powerful goddess who ruled that domain.\n\nUnbeknownst to Calypso, Davy Jones plotted with the First Brethren Court to tear the rule of the seas away from Calypso. Jones showed them how to bind her to human form. With his help, the Pirate King and the Brethren tricked the sea goddess, and bound her in her bones. Calypso was imprisoned into the body of a mortal guise: Tia Dalma. Only with all Nine Pieces of Eight could Calypso be free. With Calypso's fiery and unpredictable nature bound, the Brethren Court deemed the seas safe to travel as they so pleased. Soon Davy Jones' grief and guilt at what he had done became so great, he carved his own heart and locked it away in the Dead Man's Chest. Abandoning his duty, Jones gradually transformed into an amalgamation of human and tentacled sea creature to reflect the monster inside, and any who joined his crew suffered similar disfigurements. Calypso reflected on this and later said that the man had become a monster.\n\nOver the years, the imprisoned Calypso assumed the alias of a voodoo mystic named Tia Dalma. She began living out of a shack on the Pantano River. She kept with her a locket that matched one carried by Davy Jones, and would play a mournful tune that hinted at their lost love. Dalma befriended Jack Sparrow during his early life; the man who would go on to become the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea, and thus integral to Calypso's desire to escape her human form.\n\nWith the death of Hector Barbossa, the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea, came a prime opportunity. Tia Dalma\/Calypso needed all the Pirate Lords in order to assemble the Brethren Court, so they could release her from her human bonds. And so, through undetermined circumstances, she resurrected Barbossa from the dead and tricked him to summon a meeting of the Brethren and retrieve Jack Sparrow, who was taken to Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. Barbossa set off on a mission to free him, and therefore ensured that Jack's Piece of Eight was not lost.\n\nOn the quest for freeing Jack Sparrow from the Locker, the crew led by Barbossa captained the Hai Peng into World's End. They landed in the Locker, where Jack Sparrow noticed that the Pearl was being dragged across the sand by crabs. The ship reached the crew with the help of the crabs that were actually under the control of Calypso. After escaping the Locker, the Black Pearl went on its way to meet with the Brethren Court.\n\nBy the time the Black Pearl reached the coast of Shipwreck Island, Barbossa stood on the ship's forecastle, conversing with Tia Dalma, regarding their bargain. The mystic accused him on intending to betray her and therefore reminded him on that he was brought back from the dead by her power, and also, demonstrating her abilities by briefly decomposing Barbossa's right hand, cautioning him of his fate should he fail to keep his end of the bargain. Barbossa in turn reminded her that she, secretly the goddess Calypso, was the one who needed him; she resurrected Barbossa so he could help retrieve Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker and summon a meeting of the Brethren Court, since only the nine Pirate Lords had the power to free Calypso. To avoid the risk of the goddess reaching an accord with someone else, Barbossa ordered Pintel and Ragetti to lock Tia Dalma in the brig. Barbossa remained on deck, glancing at his right hand while contemplating his debt.\n\nBy this time, the machinations of Lord Cutler Beckett had forced the Brethren Court to convene for the fourth time in its existence, and it was here that Barbossa brought up the notion of releasing Calypso. During the meeting, Ragetti absconded with all but two of the Pirate Lords' Pieces of Eight\u2014the eighth was collected by Barbossa himself from Elizabeth Swann and the ninth from Jack Sparrow. All nine were gathered aboard the Black Pearl, where Tia Dalma had been bound. Ragetti completed the incantation that would release Calypso, and the pieces of eight set alight. Moments before she was released, Calypso finally learned who had called upon the Brethren Court to capture her all those years ago: Will Turner informed her of Davy Jones' betrayal.\n\nEnraged, Calypso, still in Dalma's form, grew massive in size, dwarfing the crew of the Pearl. After being freed from her human bonds, Calypso yelled in her native tongue, seemingly as insults to the pirates but in reality it was an incantation, before exploding outwards in a shower of crabs. Calypso's spirit, now free at last, disappeared into the air, though her influence on events was not ended. As the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman prepared for a showdown, Calypso used all of the power of the seas to unleash a terrible storm, which created a maelstrom between the two fleets. And the wind from the storm evened the balance for the Pearl and caused Davy Jones to let out a cry of anguish as he realized what the storm signified.\n\nThe battle that followed sealed Davy Jones' fate, as Jack Sparrow helped Will Turner stab Jones' disembodied heart. With his last breath, Jones whispered Calypso's name, and toppled into the maelstrom, which soon abated when the Flying Dutchman itself followed its former captain. Whether Calypso and her love were reunited after Jones' death remained unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Calypso"}}

One of which was a raid on an island where a missionary named Philip Swift was captured.\n\nLike the other zombies, Master-at-Arms still served as Blackbeard's officers by the time Angelica was able to shanghai Jack Sparrow, who was rumored to have been to the Fountain of Youth, aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. Five days afterwards, as the Queen Anne's Revenge sailed through the ocean, the recently-recruited human crewmen would work with the zombies, who used ruthless discipline to force the deckhands into following orders while working aboard the Revenge. Master-at-Arms would fight, alongside Angelica and the other zombies, against Jack Sparrow's mutiny. However, Jack's mutiny failed after Blackbeard himself appeared and used his sword to tangle the mutineers with the rigging of the Queen Anne's Revenge.\n\nAfter the Queen Anne's Revenge arrived to Whitecap Bay, Master-at-Arms participated in Blackbeard's mermaid hunt. Shortly after the battle, Blackbeard's crew managed to capture a live mermaid, who Philip Swift named \"Syrena\". The zombies would carry their prize in a glass coffin, half-filled with water, as Blackbeard's crew trekked on an island. Later, arriving to the Jungle Pools where mermaids were previously harvested of their mermaid tears, Blackbeard tried to force Syrena to cry. Master-at-Arms would grab hold of Philip, until the missionary got free and faced Angelica and Blackbeard on the situation. After Philip was seemingly killed by Quartermaster, Master-at-Arms and Yeoman dragged and dumped Philip's body nearby.

As a newborn baby, Angelica was brought to a nearby convent by her father, Blackbeard, upon her mother's passing. Because Blackbeard could not bear to raise their child alone himself, he entrusted her to the nuns for a proper upbringing. Angelica would live her childhood in a Spanish convent, reputed to be in or near Seville, as a young novitiate. Her father would sent considerable monies regularly for her care. The nuns would tell young Angelica that her pappy was a fine sea captain, away across the ocean on important business, and that he loved her very much. Angelica would know nothing else of her father for many years to come. When Angelica grew to be a young woman, she would still be living in the convent.\n\nWhen Angelica grew to be a young woman, she was still living in the Spanish convent. By the time Angelica was ready to take her vows, Angelica would meet a pirate named Jack Sparrow, who would mistake her convent for a brothel. Angelica would have had a relationship with Jack, which he would admit to having \"stirrings\" in terms of his feelings for her. In their time together, Jack stole her innocence; thus Angelica was unable to take her vows. Although they were in love, Jack would soon leave her through unknown circumstances, after which time Angelica became a formidable female pirate. Because of Jack's time with her, Angelica showed a high degree of skill in the art of deception, though it was later claimed by Jack himself the he couldn't claim credit for her existing abundance in natural talent. Although she was willing to kill, lie and steal, Angelica's belief in God remained strong. Many years later, Angelica would be reunited with her old flame after Jack had retrieved his beloved ship, the Black Pearl.\n\nThroughout their relationship, Angelica and Jack would have had times of love and hate. Some of their love involved wine, music and candlelight, which Angelica would remember well. They would also give each other gifts. Angelica would've given Jack a lace and Jack would've given Angelica a ring. However, they would later be involved in a con together on Saint Dominique, where they each attempted to double-cross the other. After her on and off relationship with Jack finally ended, Angelica continued her life as a ruthless con artist of a pirate.\n\nAt some point prior to the War Against Piracy, Angelica went to the voodoo mystic Tia Dalma and learned of the Profane Ritual, the rules of the fabled Fountain of Youth. As it was needed for the Fountain to work, Angelica learned of the ancient ceremony as well as the items needed for the ritual. For the information, Angelica had to trade her ring, given to her by Jack, to Tia Dalma as payment. Jack Sparrow himself would later find Angelica's amethyst ring in Tia's shack, during his search for the Dead Man's Chest.\n\nThrough unknown circumstances, Angelica would be reunited with her father, Blackbeard. Taking Angelica aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Blackbeard made her his second in command, giving her the rank of first mate and command over his crew of zombies. In her service aboard, Angelica proved to be a well-trusted ally to Blackbeard, though they have different views on punishment. Although Blackbeard had committed numerous wrongdoings and misdeeds, Angelica was desirous to save her father's soul from damnation.\n\nBlackbeard would soon learn of a prophecy, foreseen by the Quartermaster, which revealed Blackbeard's death in the hands of a one-legged man. This prompted Blackbeard to find the Fountain of Youth. Upon learning of this, using her knowledge of the Profane Ritual, Angelica wanted to help Blackbeard in finding the Fountain. Throughout Blackbeard's search, the Queen Anne's Revenge would encounter Jack's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, now in command of Captain Hector Barbossa. The Black Pearl was ultimately captured by Blackbeard, though Barbossa managed to escape. During one of Blackbeard's raids, his crewmen captured a young missionary, Philip Swift, in the process. Before Blackbeard had a chance to kill Philip, Angelica stopped him, as she didn't want him to kill a man of God. She also believed that Philip may be a key to redeem her father.\n\nBefore the search for the Fountain of Youth could continue, Angelica and Blackbeard needed to find Jack Sparrow, someone whom they heard had been to the Fountain. Angelica set out to find Jack and bring him aboard the Revenge. Angelica went to London and, with the help of Scrum, put the capture of Jack Sparrow into effect. Angelica, disguised as Jack Sparrow, began to assemble a crew in the Captain's Daughter tavern. Attracted by the rumors of \"Jack Sparrow recruiting a crew in London\", Jack himself came to the Captain's Daughter, where he found the disguised Angelica in the tavern. They pulled out their swords simultaneously and faced each other in a fierce duel in the storeroom.\n\nThe two ran over to the barbecue pit and circled each other. Angelica copied Jack's exact movements; Jack ran a hand down his beard and Angelica did the same, which angered Jack. They clashed swords again. Jack chased Angelica all the way up to the ceiling. The two continued fighting, carefully balancing, shortly before tumbling down along with several barrels. They resumed fighting, evenly matched. Eventually, Angelica performed an advance swordfighting technique and then pointed her sword at Jack, who then realized who the impostor was shortly before the two share a kiss. Jack gave his greeting to Angelica.\n\nAngelica and Jack had a brief reunion, conversing on Angelica's actions of impersonating Jack, with Jack disapproving that he wasn't being impersonated as captain. Angelica then asked Jack if he had really been to the Fountain of Youth. Suddenly, Scrum came in warning Angelica of King George's Royal Guards breaking into the tavern. As they bursted into the storeroom, Angelica and Jack fought against the guards together. Angelica and Jack had the upper hand by slicing open barrels, ale spraying at the guards. The Royal Guards eventually aimed their rifles at them. Angelica and Jack glanced at each other, shortly before Angelica slashes at a lever. They fell through a trapdoor into water and swam away, surfacing in the River Thames.\n\nAs the two scramble ashore, Jack learned that Angelica knew about the Profane Ritual. He then inquired about the ritual and what was required. Angelica told him that a mermaid was needed at the exact moment that Jack felt a voodoo dart hit him from behind, shot by the Quartermaster. Angelica had Jack taken aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, where the quest for the legendary spring continued.\n\nDuring the journey, while Angelica did her duties as first mate, Jack Sparrow and many other shanghaied sailors were forced to work as deckhands. As Angelica made her way below deck, she was immediately confronted by Jack himself, who held a hook at her throat, calling her a ruthless, soulless cur for taking him aboard Blackbeard's ship. Angelica tried to calm Jack down by saying that Blackbeard would listen to her, his own daughter. Jack was bewildered by that claim, but Angelica was able to make Jack believe she was conning Blackbeard. She then told Jack of the prophecy, foreseen by the Quartermaster, that Blackbeard would die in the hands of a one-legged man.\n\nWhen Jack led a mutiny on the Revenge, he entered Angelica's cabin, where he saw her sleeping. He quietly tried to take a sword and a pair of boots. As he took them, a dazed Angelica tells Jack that if it is a dream, he can keep the sword and boots. Jack reassures her that it's a dream, at least until Angelica hears swords clashing outside her cabin. Jack then warns her that he is taking the ship. Angelica angrily curses at Jack as he leaves to lock her in her cabin, she grabs her sword and as Jack closes the cabin door and locks it. Angelica stabs her sword through the door, inches away from Jack's head.\n\nAngelica later escaped her cabin and joined the fight, which began well for Jack and his co-conspirators. At the moment of Jack's victory, Blackbeard appeared on the deck and used the power of his sword to crush the mutiny. Following the mutiny, Blackbeard intended to kill Jack but was interrupted by Angelica, reminding him that they needed Jack in order to find the Fountain. Then was interrupted again by missionary Philip Swift, whom Blackbeard attempted to shoot. But Angelica once again stopped him, as she didn't want him to harm a man of God. Blackbeard seemed touched that his daughter would go to such lengths to save him. Angelica then told her father that every soul could be saved, with Philip agreeing to the comment. Because of Angelica's faith, Blackbeard put away his pistol.\n\nWhen Blackbeard found out that the Cook, who was to stood watch that night, was part of the mutiny, he ordered him to go into the longboat. Angelica realized what her father was about to do and desperately pleaded to not kill the Cook. Her plea was ignored, and Blackbeard then orders his men to fire the Greek fire cannons. A horrified Angelica watches alongside her father as the Cook was blasted as he was rowing away from the Queen Anne's Revenge. Angelica leaves as the Cook is killed. Afterwards, the Quartermaster took Jack Sparrow to Blackbeard's cabin for a talk. Whilst the two are talking, Angelica listened at the door as she heard Jack telling Blackbeard of Angelica's true nature. Angelica interrupts Jack as her father tortured Jack with a voodoo doll, which they used to force Jack into agreeing to lead them to the Fountain.\n\nLater, as Angelica arrived on the main deck, Jack had Scrum play the mandola in a romantic tone as he offered a drink. Angelica became flattered then suspicious of Jack's actions. They then recalled their previous encounters in La Martinique and Saint Dominique. As Scrum began playing his mandola vigorously, Jack walked Angelica to dance on deck. While they danced, Jack told Angelica that they could go to the Fountain of Youth together and have equal shares of fame in exchange for knowledge of the Profane Ritual. While Angelica was skeptical into trusting Jack, she reconsidered after Jack gave her the ring that she traded to Tia Dalma in the years prior. Angelica revealed the ritual to Jack: water from the Fountain, a mermaid's tear, and the Silver Chalices of Ponce de León. Angelica also revealed that the items would be used to take all the years of life from another, a sacrifice, hence why they can't go by themselves. Though Jack's willingness to find the Fountain was lessened, Angelica attempted to bribe him by promising something he wanted.\n\nAngelica then showed Jack a cabinet full of Blackbeard's trophies\u2014shrunken ships in a bottles, each containing a ship that Blackbeard vanquished. Angelica promised Jack that he would get to choose any of the ships, though she knew the ship he'd choose\u2014the Black Pearl. Angelica tells Jack that she needs those years of the victim for Blackbeard, revealing that she truly was his daughter. Jack tried to warn Angelica otherwise about trying to save Blackbeard, saying that he cannot be redeemed and would kill her. Before they could go further into the discussion, the Queen Anne's Revenge arrived to Whitecap Bay, a mermaid nesting ground.\n\nArriving to Whitecap Bay, along with Blackbeard and his crew, Angelica helped try to attempt to capture a mermaid, as they needed a mermaid's tear for the ritual. While some of the men deployed large fishing nets in the shallows, Angelica joined Blackbeard and a few of the other crewmen as they made their way to the top of the old lighthouse. After Salaman was able to get the lighthouse in working condition, Angelica watched as Blackbeard launched several longboats in the water to attract the mermaids. The song from one of the men in the boats, Scrum, soon attracted a group of mermaids. The mermaids, after a few minutes of hesitation, attacked the boats and their crews. The Bay turned into a battlefield, where mermaids attempted to kill all of the men in the boats. After a while, the mermaids began to attack the onshore crew by using ropes of seaweed to pull them into the sea. Soon Angelica was pulled by one of the mermaids' seaweed ropes, leaving Jack Sparrow to save her.\n\nAfter Jack made the lighthouse explode, the mermaids escaped through the waters. Though it looked that Blackbeard's attack was a failure, with all mermaids on the shore dead, Philip Swift managed to capture one mermaid, stabbing the end of her tail with his cutlass. Blackbeard praised him for capturing the creature and ordered to sail for a protective cove. Angelica found Jack's sword, which he lost in the mermaid attack, and tossed it to him as the crew prepared to leave to continue their quest.\n\nAfter relocating the Queen Anne's Revenge to a protected cove of the island, Blackbeard and his men came inland to continue their quest for the Fountain of Youth. They needed to find the Santiago, a ship captained by Ponce de León which was stranded somewhere on the island. The two Chalices of Cartagena, the other important item needed for the ritual, were hidden aboard the ship. And so Angelica and Blackbeard had to find them. Jack Sparrow guided them through jungles and swamps with the help of his mystical compass, but the crew soon discovered an insurmountable obstacle; a broken bridge.\n\nAngelica and Jack had a brief argument over which way to go, as one way goes away from the path of the Chalices, which would waste the time needed. Blackbeard then decided that someone would cross the river and retrieve the Chalices, while the rest of the crew will continue towards the Fountain. Though Angelica was not sure about the idea, Blackbeard took Jack's compass and ordered him to jump into the river. When Jack refused to jump from the high cliff, to Angelica's dismay, Blackbeard pulled out his pistol and threatened to kill Angelica herself. Though Sparrow didn't believe that he would kill his own daughter, Blackbeard gave his pistol to the Quartermaster who had placed it with six more pistols, with only two of them being loaded, but not knowing which. Angelica was shocked by this action.\n\nForcing Jack to choose one of them, Blackbeard took the pistol from him and pointed it into Angelica, pulling the trigger. To Angelica's relief, the pistol wasn't loaded, but Blackbeard forced Jack to choose again. When Jack fired the loaded pistol into air, he knew that Blackbeard was serious, and he asked the Quartermaster about the possibility of survival if he jumps into the river. The Quartermaster took the Jack voodoo doll from Angelica, and threw it into the river, showing that he would indeed survive the jump. When an impatient Angelica attempted to jump, Jack jumped before her, falling into the river, and appeared on the surface a moment later.\n\nSeeing that Jack ultimately followed what her father asked, she complimented Blackbeard's attempt, saying that he did know which pistols were loaded. Blackbeard assured her that he did know which ones were loaded. As Jack proceeded to the Santiago, Angelica and the crew continued to search for the Fountain.\n\nWhile Angelica journeyed with Blackbeard and his crew through the jungles, the captured mermaid was carried in a glass tank filled with sea water. But when one of the the zombie crewmen, Yeoman, accidentally tripped, the tank fell to the ground, breaking. The mermaid fell to the ground, and before the shocked eyes of the pirates, her tail transformed into a pair of human legs. Philip Swift quickly gave her his shirt to cover her. After Blackbeard threatened her, Philip decided to carry her for the rest of the journey, later naming her Syrena.\n\nThe crew later found the Jungle Pools, where mermaids had previously been tied up and left to die. With Angelica's help, upon learning that Syrena and Philip fancy each other, Blackbeard decided to use Philip. Syrena was put into one of the pools while Blackbeard tried to force her to cry. However, Syrena would not yield. Realizing that Syrena would remain strong, Blackbeard had the Quartermaster kill Philip, although in reality he only sedated him with a voodoo dart. Syrena was seemingly left to die while Philip's body was dumped nearby. Angelica waited with the crew until Philip regained consciousness and managed to make Syrena cry with a tear of joy when they were reunited. After giving her father Syrena's tear in a vial, Angelica continued on with Blackbeard in their quest.\n\nWith Angelica holding Jack's compass, Blackbeard and his crew searched through jungles, until they met up with Jack Sparrow. Sparrow was successful in finding the Chalices, which were tied up to a wild boar that was held down by Joshamee Gibbs. However, Jack had conditions to make before he handed them over, which Blackbeard accepted. Once Blackbeard took the Chalices, the crew continued on with their journey towards the Fountain of Youth.\n\nAfter much searching through the jungles, Jack found the cave entrance to the Fountain of Youth. The Quartermaster led the rest of the crew deep inside the cave, until they reached a dead end. Upon seeing the supposed end of the quest and Jack's unsuccessful attempt to gain entrance into the Fountain by hitting the two Chalices against one another, that Angelica knew that Jack had never been to the Fountain. Angered by this revelation, Blackbeard ordered the Quartermaster to kill Jack. However, after Jack read the words inscribed on the Chalices, \"Aqua de Vida\", water gradually rose along the walls of the cave into a pool above their heads. Angelica watched as Jack was sucked into it. The rest of the crew followed Jack through the pool, and ended up in the Fountain of Youth. As Angelica gazed at the Fountain's beauty, Jack walked further to the Fountain itself, a natural stone archway-like basin with water dripping through. Blackbeard told Jack that he would be the first to drink from the waters. However, before he could be given that chance, Angelica warned Blackbeard of an unwanted visitor appearing out of the mist, the one-legged man who was destined to kill him.\n\nAt that moment, Angelica realized that Jack had led Hector Barbossa, a privateer in King George's court, to the Fountain. She watched as Barbossa declared Blackbeard as his prisoner. Blackbeard then ordered his crew to attack Barbossa's men, in which a battle between the crews ensued at the Fountain. As the fight went on, Angelica briefly confronted with Jack, with Scrum at her side, pointing her sword at him. Suddenly, after Angelica said that she was going to take Jack's years, Jack tossed the mermaid's tear into the air. Angelica tried to grab it, which caused her and Scrum to throw their swords up in the air as well, and both swords end up in Jack's hands. After another toss around, Jack ended up with the tear and Scrum ended up with the Chalices. Jack kicked the Chalices out of Scrum's hands over to the other side of the Fountain. Jack and Angelica then end up in a struggle with the Chalices, until the Spaniard and his men arrive.\n\nAfter the Spaniard killed off one of Barbossa's men, Jack gave the Chalices to Angelica as the Spaniard walked towards them. The Spaniard then asked Angelica for the Chalices. Though Angelica refused to let him take the Chalices, two of the Spaniard's men held her down so he could take them. Angelica watched as the Spaniard revealed the Spanish's true intentions\u2014to destroy the Fountain of Youth. He then smashed the Chalices and tossed them into a deep pool and ordered his men to destroy the Fountain.\n\nAs the Spanish began destroying the temple, Barbossa stabbed Blackbeard with his sword. Horrified of what had happened, Angelica ran to her father's side to remove the sword. Jack tried to warn her that Barbossa's sword was poisoned, but it was too late as she cut her hand and poisoned herself in the process. Seeing that Angelica was in danger, Jack ran to find the Chalices while the Spanish began pulling down the columns of the Fountain. As Angelica desperately tried to help her father, the remainder of Blackbeard's crewmen left with Barbossa. The Spanish pulled over a large column and crushed the Fountain as well as the Quartermaster and Gunner, who were fighting off the Spanish soldiers. The Spanish then left as Jack ran to Angelica and Blackbeard with the Chalices in hand, one of them having Syrena's tear, to perform the Profane Ritual.\n\nJack offered both Blackbeard and Angelica the Chalices, with Angelica to drink the cup with the tear while Blackbeard drank the one that takes life. Angelica refused, as she didn't want Blackbeard to die unredeemed. Jack tried to convince Blackbeard to save his dying daughter. But Blackbeard quickly grabbed the cup with the tear and drank it. He then told Angelica to save him. Though shocked at what her father did, Angelica willingly drank from the other Chalice. Knowing that she was going to die, she told her father that she loved him. However, Jack revealed that he may have switched the cups.\n\nAngelica's wound immediately healed as the flowing waters of the Fountain rushed towards Blackbeard. Jack watched as the Fountain's waters completely surrounded Blackbeard as his flesh rots away. The waters then cleared away as Blackbeard's skeleton collapsed, dead.\n\nLater, Jack Sparrow had Angelica tied up aboard a row boat as he took her to Sola Fide Beach. Even though her own life was saved, Angelica told Jack that she hated him because she felt the years she possessed were stolen from Blackbeard, her own father. Jack told Angelica that he helped Blackbeard do what any father should have done in that situation. Angelica told Jack that he was cruel and ignorant.\n\nUpon arriving to the desert island, Jack threw Angelica ashore and tossed her a pistol with a single shot. Angelica asked how she was to get free of her bonds. Jack responded by saying that she freed herself and was waiting for a chance to jump him. Angelica then desperately tried to convince Jack not to leave her there by first trying to get him to admit that he still loved her, then telling him about a treasure with jewels, and that she was pregnant with his child. Jack refused all those claims, believing them to be lies.\n\nDesperate, Angelica then told Jack something she claimed that she wanted to say from the moment they first met, she loved him. Jack then stated that he did as well and always will. They lean in to kiss each other, but not before Jack ran for his dinghy. Angelica angrily called out to Jack and then decided to use her pistol with one shot to try and shoot him. However, she missed and hit the water. Jack rowed away in his longboat as Angelica was simply left to curse at him.\n\nBecause of Jack, Angelica was now marooned on Sola Fide. The only thing she would do in her spare time was to sit alone on the rocks to gaze at the waves. She would soon notice the Jack Sparrow voodoo doll bobbing towards her, as if delivered by fate. Angelica picked it up and smiles. Her further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Angelica"}}

At the Brethren Court meeting he was reasonable and logical in his comments, pointing out what he thought others needed to be reminded of. When his rival Eduardo Villanueva pulled a pistol on him, he took it very personally and punched Villanueva in the face. He took his bad financial situation in stride, and was apparently not ashamed about it, even saying, \"Capitaine Chevalle, the penniless Frenchman\" when he cast his vote for Pirate King. Chevalle had great respect for Sri Sumbhajee, thinking that, \"His wisdom [ran] deeper than the bowels of the Kraken.\""],"name":"Chevalle","description":"Chevalle was a former member of the French aristocracy and the Pirate Lord of the Mediterranean Sea. He spent many years pillaging the weak and wealthy trade ships of Europe in his flagship, the Fancy, as well as trading between the Old World and the New World in the French Caribbean Colonies, such as Montserrat and Haiti. He was also known to plunder the Spanish Treasure Fleets of fellow Pirate Lord, Captain Eduardo Villanueva as they returned from such locales as Mexico.\n\nHe was wanted dead or alive by the East India Trading Company for crimes including piracy in the French seas, attempting to steal from the Swiss Bank, and defacement and destruction of French property both on land and at sea. The reward was 6,000 guineas.\n\nPrior to the fourth meeting of the Brethren Court, Chevalle had fallen upon hard times, and was at some point captured by royal marines under the command of Lord Cutler Beckett. Chevalle was tried and sentenced to hang at Fort Charles in the town of Port Royal, now under the control of the East India Trading Company. Fortune sent Jack Sparrow to Port Royal, where he met with the mystic Tia Dalma, who told Jack of Chevalle's dire situation. So Jack made his way towards the fort to effect the rescue of Chevalle. As a condition of the rescue, Jack requested that Chevalle join the Brethren Conclave at Shipwreck City. Grateful for his rescue, Chevalle agreed and bade Jack farewell as the two pirates made their escape from Port Royal and later rejoining with other members of the Brethren.\n\nThere were two known circumstances of how Jack managed to save Chevalle from his appointment with the gallows. Prior to his execution, Chevalle was held in the stockades, being pelted by the citizens of Port Royal with fruits and vegetables, much to Chevalle's indignation. Jack managed to make a distraction by releasing the prisoners from their cells, set some gun powder within the yard to cover their escape, and blocked the entrances to the yard to stop reinforcements before weakening the supports to the stocks platform, thereby making it easy to free Chevalle. Another known occurrence was that Jack Sparrow and Will Turner enlisted the help of Montanari to smuggle them into Fort Charles. During Chevalle's execution, the hangman's rope snapped, revealing that it had been sabotaged by Jack Sparrow himself. Considering the escape as partial payment for a night in Tangiers, Jack rescued Chevalle and escaped from Fort Charles.\n\nChevalle was reunited with his crew, and sailed to Shipwreck Cove to join the Brethren Court meeting. During the meeting, Chevalle punched Villanueva in the face when he pulled a pistol on him. Chevalle was against Captain Hector Barbossa's idea of setting Calypso free, on the grounds that she would most likely be in a foul mood upon her release. He also thought it was unlikely that a second Pirate King would ever be elected, and so was more in favor of Mistress Ching's idea of waiting out the war in Shipwreck Cove. Chevalle voted for himself when the time came to elect a new king, but Elizabeth Swann won, and upon receiving her new position, she declared war on the East India Trading Company.\n\nLord Beckett, however, had sent a force of Black Coats against them, in order to delay their departure.

Upon exiting Shipwreck Cove, the Brethren were confronted with Lord Beckett's entire armada. King Swann went to treat with the Company, but to no avail. Swann ordered the fleet to hoist their colors, and Chevalle begrudgingly had his flag raised, and looked over the fleet with a grim uncertainty, and seemed very doubtful that the fleet would survive, deeming his favored idea of defense within the Cove to have been the better decision all along.\n\nChevalle later witnessed the battle around Calypso's maelstrom, and celebrated with his crew following the deaths of Davy Jones and Lord Beckett.

Walter watched many of the island towns sprout up from out of the jungles \u2013 spending most of his youth roaming the wilds of Jamaica and the surrounding islands. His father\u2019s business prospered and he soon took on Walter as an apprentice. He learned every aspect of shipbuilding and sailing \u2013 making Walter an excellent sailor.\n\nWhen his father unexpectedly died, Walter took over the family business. After a fierce storm, Walt was almost wiped out and in dire need of money. An old friend named Joshamee Gibbs persuaded him to sail aboard a pirate ship to make some easy cash. He so loved the Pirate life, Walter never looked back.\n\nIt has also been said that Captain Walter and Captain Ezekiel Rott had some past connection, a bad relationship of hate. Apparently Rott blames Walter for his current state. Walter may have even had a connection with the rest of Casa de Muertos. Both the captains had gotten into fights several times, especially an altercation over Rott's involvement in the Minertown incident.\n\nCaptain Walter helped lead the pirates to victory in the Battle of Padres, where the Marceline Guild sank over 40 EITC ships. Captured and put on trial, the authorities could not prove that Captain Walter led the attacks on the EITC , so he was released. Lord Cutler Beckett , head of the EITC, loathes Captain Walter because he always eludes his grasp.\n\nCaptain Walter has been bringing Pirates together in masses to take on the might of the East India Trading Company's assassin force, the Black Guard.\n\nHis close friendship with the infamous pirate Jack Sparrow has triggered the anger of the Company, which ultimately responded to this by interrupting the processions of many Brethren Feasts and Pirate raids, The Company have also sent their best hit-men to take on him and his guild of scoundrels to bring them to the Gallows.\n\nRecently, before or after the mysterious explosion of the volcanic island Padres Del Fuego, with the East India Company increasing its best ships at sea, the Marceline led by Walter led the Battle of Padres resulting in a reduction of a number of the Company's ships they could muster.\n\nRecently with the beginning of the War for the Caribbean in the form of island Invasions by undead troops of Jolly Roger, Captain Walter and the Marceline guild had led pirates into a number of raids in the haunted caves of Tortuga to battle off the skeletal scourge by attacking them at their own base. This was done to prevent an invasion for Tortuga by Jolly Roger to capture Captain Jack Sparrow.\n\nSadly, Captain Walter has gone missing in the chaos that now rules the Caribbean. He was last seen aboard the Magic, sailing off to help stop the EITC Expedition Fleets. Since that day, no one has seen or heard from him.\n\nSoon after Sandra Tew began having visions of a duel between Captain Walter and Captain Ezekiel Rott of the Casa de Muertos guild, Ruby Wynn, James Howe and Xavier Hench arrived on Cuba , prepared to question Rott as to where their beloved captain had disappeared to. After gaining the support of several pirates, Ruby, Xavier, and other loyal pirates drove Rott out of his hiding place in the tavern and cornered him, demanding to know Captain Walter's whereabouts. After much pressure, Rott revealed that he had stowed away on Captain Walter's ship, the Magic, when Walter departed to combat the EITC Expedition Fleets from Tortuga. On board the ship, Rott challenged Captain Walter to a duel in which the good captain was defeated.\n\nSoon after his death he appeared on Cuba in a phantasmal ghost form.

Together, they decided to make a life in the New World. They decided to open a tavern in Tortuga, thinking the port was mostly a stop for merchants and sailors.\n\nAfter opening the Faithful Bride, the couple discovered that Tortuga was a haven for pirates. They did their best despite this upset, but had financial trouble due to pirates not paying their bills and smashing the furniture. To make matters worse, her husband had become an alcoholic.\n\nOne day, Laura overheard a rumrunner complaining that he was having trouble getting past English officials. Smith offered her help in order to make some money. The plan was successful because Royal officials were unwilling to harass a lady and the organization grew, expanding into new areas.\n\nEverything went wrong one day when Left-Foot Louis betrayed her. She was dragged out of the tavern in front of her daughter, Arabella. Outside, she and Louis dueled. Ultimately, she escaped on La Fleur de la Mort, though her daughter believed Louis had killed her. She vowed to return when she had the money to provide Arabella with the life she deserved.\n\nYears later, Louis was magically transported to the deck of her ship by the Sword of Cortés\u2014wielded by Arabella on Isla Fortuna. Laura considered killing him, but decided to let him work with her crew. Shortly afterwards, she happened upon Arabella. She tried to explain what happened and establish a relationship, but Arabella was mad that her mother had never thought to tell her that she was still alive.\n\nWhile Arabella and the crew of the Barnacle was aboard the ship, all of Laura's crew\u2014with the exception of Reece\u2014mutinied against her. With the help of Jack Sparrow's crew, Laura fought off the mutiny, and retained command of her ship. Laura implored Arabella to remain aboard, though Laura made the decision for her, cutting the last line holding the Barnacle to the Fleur. Arabella was trapped aboard her mother's ship.\n\nThe Barnacle and the Fleur both sailed to New Orleans. Both crews met up with each other in the city and embarked on a mission to recover the Sun-and-stars amulet from Madame Minuit. Minuit combined herself, Left-Foot Louis, and Silverback into a giant, snake-like creature to kill Jack Sparrow and Mr. Reece. Laura left with Arabella to wait out the battle. Ultimately, Jack and Reece emerged, wounded severely but victorious. Despite all that had happened, Laura took the crew of the Barnacle except Jack and Fitzwilliam aboard her ship.\n\nWith a new crew, Laura set out. They met Billy Turner during their travels and took him on after he helped them defeat a British Royal Navy ship, a fierce sea beast and a group of pirates. Disapproving of her daughter's romantic attraction to Billy, Laura found herself taken prisoner, and held within Poseidon's Peak alongside her crew. There, they met Jack again, and helped him defeat Captain Torrents.

The blackest soul and the darkest heart of any pirate who ever lived, striking fear into the bravest of sailors, Blackbeard was a name uttered in terror by all who sail the sea, or any unfortunate enough to encounter him on dry land. Blackbeard's many exploits became the stuff of various myths and legends of pirate lore, including the legend of being killed and beheaded by Royal Marines during the battle of Ocracoke Inlet in 1718.","Another example would Blackbeard being in charge of the massive mermaid hunt, slaughter, and mermaid capture. Blackbeard hatched a plan to catch a mermaid, but would not do the fishing himself, having sent out a boatload of sailors as 'bait' and force them to sing to attract the mermaids to their doom. He had handpicked members of his crew for the dangerous job; the ones he can do without. And though some of his crewmen tried to retreat to land, Blackbeard fired his pistol, saying \"There be no refuge on land,\" in order to force his men to go back in the water to capture a mermaid.","Like most pirates, Blackbeard was an excellent swordsman, gaining his fighting skills during the long years of fighting at sea, first as a privateer, and later as a pirate. Combining his skills with his legendary cruelty, Blackbeard was a deadly opponent to any man who were brave enough to challenge him. The only known person who had survived a duel with Blackbeard was Hector Barbossa."],"name":"Blackbeard","description":"Legends claim that Blackbeard's real name was not definitely known, though he was often called \"Edward Teach\". It was believed that Edward Teach was born in Bristol, born in poverty and raised in squalor in the late 17th century. At an early age, Teach left Bristol aboard a merchantman, jumped ship in the Caribbean, and signed on board as a privateer. He served on an English privateer ship in the Queen Anne's War, sailing from Jamaica and fighting against the Spanish and the French in the Spanish West Indies and along the Spanish Main. When the war ended in 1713, King George decided to withdraw all Letters of Marque, and Teach found himself unemployed.\n\nLike many other former privateers, Teach decided to turn to piracy. He sailed for New Providence where he joined the pirate crew of captain Benjamin Hornigold. Soon, Teach earned Hornigold's trust and became the First Mate on his ship, the Ranger. While under Hornigold\u2019s command, Blackbeard served with several men who would later become pirate captains, including Samuel Bellamy, Paulsgrave Williams, and Olivier Levasseur \"La Buse\". Blackbeard was exceptionally loyal to Hornigold, remaining in his pirate band after many others defected. He was given control of various prizes in 1716, but didn't receive his first truly independent command in September 1717. This was the Revenge, the sloop of the wayward gentleman pirate Stede Bonnet, who had shown up in Nassau grievously wounded. Blackbeard used her to attack shipping off the Carolinas, Virginia, and Delaware, then took a direct, offshore passage to the outer rim of the eastern Caribbean.\n\nOn November 28, 1717, off the coast of Martinique, Teach captured La Concorde de Nantes, a French frigate on a slave trading voyage from Africa. La Concorde was the grandest and most elegant ship that Teach ever captured, so he decided to keep her for himself. Teach converted her into a pirate ship, increased the number of cannons to 38, and renamed her the Queen Anne's Revenge. He soon began to grow a long, thick, black beard, eventually assuming the cognomen: \"Blackbeard\". Unlike most pirates, who sailed under the traditional black Jolly Roger flag sporting a skull and crossbones, Blackbeard chose a completely unique symbol as his own variation. His flag depicted a skeleton of the devil holding a goblet of wine in one hand and a spear pointing to a bleeding heart in the other, as if he's toasting his victims. Such an intimidating flag was a clear message to his potential victims\u2014they would all die if they don't surrender immediately.\n\nThus fortified, Blackbeard's gang brought a wave of terror to the eastern Caribbean in late November and early December 1717, burning Guadeloupe town and most of the vessels at St. Kitts. Teach's next great battle was with the large British merchantman, the Great Allen, off the coast of St. Vincent. After a lengthy battle Blackbeard took the ship. The crew of the captured ship was sent to shore in the longboats, but the cargo was plundered, and the ship burned and left to sink. A few days later, near the island of St. Thomas, Blackbeard's small fleet encountered the HMS Seaford, a 22-gun sixth-rate frigate of the British Royal Navy. The pirates raised the British flags, doing their best to look like simple merchant vessels. The British didn't see through the pirate deception, and let the small fleet pass undisturbed. This event would be later exaggerated as a full scale battle between the pirate fleet and one other Royal Navy vessel, the HMS Scarborough. In a repeatedly misinterpreted story the pirates were able to defeat the Scarborough and force her to escape back to Barbados. Though the story wasn't true, it helped to increase Blackbeard's notoriety.\n\nDuring the next few months, Blackbeard preyed on coastal settlements of the West Indies and the Atlantic coast of North America. He plundered around forty merchant ships, sparing the crews and ships which surrendered immediately, but burning the ships of those who resisted. The Protestant Caesar, a merchant ship from Boston, was burned by Blackbeard because of a few pirates who were hanged there.\n\nBlackbeard's gang spent the winter of 1717-1718 in Central American and made their way into Cuban waters. Blackbeard now had three ships in his fleet, and he preyed on many more, eventually making his way up into the Florida Keys where he captured a Spanish sloop.\n\nBlackbeard's chief claim to fame was his blockade of Charleston, South Carolina. In approximately late May of 1718, Blackbeard entered the mouth of Charleston harbour with the Queen Anne's Revenge and three lighter vessels. He plundered five merchant freighters attempting to enter or leave the port. No other vessels could transit the harbour for fear of encountering the pirate squadron.\n\nAboard one of the ships that Blackbeard captured in the harbour mouth was a group of prominent Charleston citizens. Blackbeard held these hostages for ransom, making an unusual demand: a chest of medicines. He sent a deputation ashore to negotiate this ransom. Due partly to his envoys' preference for carousing rather than bargaining, the ransom took some days to be delivered, and Blackbeard evidently came close to murdering his prisoners. Eventually, the medicines were turned over, and Blackbeard released the hostages, sans all their clothing but otherwise unharmed. Blackbeard's whole squadron then escaped northward.\n\nShortly afterward, Blackbeard ran two of his vessels aground at Topsail Inlet, including the Queen Anne's Revenge. He has been accused by many, including his own crew, of doing this deliberately in order to downsize his crew and increase his own share of the treasure. Deliberate or not, Blackbeard stripped three of the ships of all treasure, beached or marooned most of his crew, and went to Bath, North Carolina, where he finally accepted a Royal Pardon. The governor preformed the marriage ceremony for Mary Ormond, his 14th wife (twelve of his previous wives were believed still alive). However Blackbeard later went back into his old pirate ways. He then went off to Ocracoke Inlet in the last of his four vessels, the sloop Adventure, to enjoy his loot.\n\nHaving accepted a Pardon, Teach had apparently retired from piracy. However, Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia became concerned that the notorious freebooter lived nearby. Spotswood decided to eliminate Blackbeard, even though he lived outside of Spotswood's jurisdiction.\n\nBlackbeard operated in coastal waters; it was difficult for ships of the line to engage him in battle. As such, two smaller hired sloops were therefore put under the command of Lieutenant Robert Maynard, with instructions from Spotswood to track down and destroy Blackbeard, offering a reward of £100, and smaller sums for the lesser crew members. Maynard sailed from James River on November 11, 1718, in command of thirty men from the HMS Pearl, and twenty-five men and a midshipman of the HMS Ranger. Maynard found the pirates anchored in a North Carolina inlet on the inner side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of November 21. Maynard and his men decided to wait until the following morning because the tide would be more favorable. Blackbeard's ship, Adventure, had a crew of only nineteen, \"Thirteen white and six Negroes\", as reported to the Admiralty. On November 22, at dawn, a small boat was sent ahead, was fired upon, and quickly retreated. Blackbeard's superior knowledge of the inlet was of much help, although he and his crew had been drinking in his cabin the night prior. Throughout the night Blackbeard waited for Maynard to make his move. Blackbeard cut his anchor cable and quickly attempted to move towards a narrow channel. Maynard made chase; however his sloops ran aground, and there was a shouted exchange between the two captains.\n\nMaynard's account says, \"At our first salutation, he drank Damnation to me and my Men, whom he stil'd Cowardly Puppies, saying, He would neither give nor take Quarter\", although many different versions of the dialogue exist. Eventually, Maynard's sloops were able to float freely again, and he began to row towards Blackbeard, since the wind was not strong enough at the time for setting sail. When they came upon Blackbeard's Adventure, they were hit with a devastating broadside attack. Midshipman Hyde, captain of the smaller HMS Ranger, was killed along with six other men. Ten men were also wounded in the surprise attack. The sloop fell astern and was little help in the following action. Maynard continued his pursuit in the HMS Pearl, managing to blast the Adventures rigging, forcing it ashore. Maynard ordered many of his crew into the holds and readied to be boarded. As his ship approached, Blackbeard saw the mostly empty decks, assumed it was safe to board, and did so with ten men. Maynard's men emerged, and the battle began.\n\nAccording to various legends and lore, Blackbeard was killed in battle. During the fight aboard Lieutenant Maynard's sloop, Blackbeard was attacked with about twenty musket balls and six cutlass wounds. Eventually, the mighty Blackbeard succumbed to his many wounds and fell to the deck, dead. After that, as a show of victory, Maynard took his sword and behead the infamous pirate. Legends about Blackbeard's death immediately sprang up among many pirates and sailors, including the oft-repeated claim that his headless body swam three times around the Adventure before climbing back on board. Blackbeard's head was placed as a trophy on the bowsprit of the ship, while all his remaining crewmembers were all but two executed. Later, Blackbeard's head hung from a pike in Bath Town.\n\nHowever, Blackbeard was not killed at all. Through unknown circumstances, he was able to escape this grim fate. He returned to the wreck of his old ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, and had her repaired as his flagship once again. At some point in repairing the Revenge, Blackbeard had a cage put on the back, added a Greek fire-based weapon on the bow, and had the entire ship decorated with the skeletons of his victims as trophies. Blackbeard soon continued in his life of committing various acts of piracy, treason, and murder.\n\nAt some point in time, Blackbeard would have obtained the Sword of Triton, a powerful weapon said to be forged in lost Atlantis. Brandishing the sword, Blackbeard commanded unearthly power as it channeled mystical power that brought dead matter to life. Blackbeard used the sword on a number of occasions, including sea battles, increasing the speed of his voyages, and to keep members of his crew in line.\n\nThrough mysterious circumstances, Blackbeard studied Voodoo to his own ends, eventually becoming a master of the dark arts. It is unknown what he had to go through to get to his level of ability, but legends have said Blackbeard studied on his journeys through South America, Africa, and Spain, and learned from sailors who traveled the world, a variety of beliefs and techniques. Blackbeard knew more than Voodoo, but he mainly practiced Voodoo. Because of his passion for the forbidden dark magic, he changed his pirate flag from a horned, spear wielding devilish skeleton, to a large flaming skull. As a Brujos, Blackbeard could resurrect those he had killed through rituals, and began to include jumbees and zombies to his crew. Possessed of a tattered soul, lost to the forces of darkness, Blackbeard was to known to have practiced his supernatural powers in the captain's cabin on the Queen Anne's Revenge. Blackbeard also learned how to turn the vessels he captured into ships in individual glass bottles, where they all sailed on a shrunken, churning ocean. He would keep a collection of ships in bottles inside a cabinet found in his cabin.\n\nIt is unknown exactly when but through undetermined circumstances, Blackbeard met a woman of Spanish origin. They had a relationship together where they ultimately conceived a child, an infant girl whom they named Angelica. Upon his wife's untimely death, Blackbeard was heartbroken as he considered her good to his bad, light to his dark, angel to the devil inside him. He took his newborn daughter to a Spanish convent, where he entrusted her to the nuns for a proper upbringing. Though it was said that Blackbeard could not bear to raise his child alone, it is more probable that he wanted to keep her protected, innocent of the evils of men, for as long as possible.\n\nEvery so often, Blackbeard would send considerable monies to the nuns for Angelica's care. The nuns would tell young Angelica that her pappy was a fine sea captain, away across the ocean on important business, and that he loved her very much. The nuns never asked how Blackbeard came by his riches, because they knew very well where the riches came from. On one occasion, a group of villains attempted to steal the money from the nuns, but the entire group ended up dead and buried out in the vineyard, probably thanks to Blackbeard.\n\nOver the decades, Blackbeard's activities on the high seas increased. With his supernatural powers and mystical sword, no ship was safe from him as he became renowned as the \"pirate all pirates fear\". Among his many victories in battle, Blackbeard was known to have captured one ship of the line, and had battled magic creatures who looked to be conjured out of water. As he grew older and close to death, Blackbeard developed a high regard of fate and believed that every soul had an appointment with death.\n\nDuring the great conflict between the pirates, the East India Trading Company, and the undead army of Jolly Roger, Blackbeard often sent the Queen Anne's Revenge to stalk ships at sea under the command of his loyal Jumbee First Mate, LaSchafe. However, Jolly Roger used that opportunity to make a Voodoo Doll of LaSchafe, and took control of Blackeard's first mate and his soulless crew. Controlled by Jolly Roger's voodoo powers, and always thirsty for battle and fresh victims, LaSchafe and his jumbees started to attack pirate ships in the Caribbean. For many months, the Queen Anne's Revenge sailed around wild islands like Isla Cangrejos, Isla Perdida, and Isla Tormenta, attacking ships of the Brethren Court. But, through unknown circumstances, Blackbeard managed to retake the Revenge.\n\nThrough unknown circumstances, Blackbeard would be reunited with his beloved daughter, Angelica. He took her aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, where they had a formidable partnership. Blackbeard had been unbeatable since Angelica joined forces with him and became a notable apprentice. He soon trusted her well enough to give her the rank of first mate aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. As second-in-command of his infamous vessel, Angelica proved to be a well-trusted ally to Blackbeard, though they have different views on punishment. Although Blackbeard had committed numerous wrongdoings and misdeeds, Angelica wanted him to become a better man and prevent his eternal soul from damnation and descending into darkness.\n\nOne of Blackbeard's zombie officers, the Quartermaster, had gained a second sight so that he was able to see things before they happen, including a prophecy which foretold Blackbeard's death in the hands of a one-legged man. Despite knowing it would be foolish to battle fate, Blackbeard was tempted to cheat it. So in order to escape his inevitable death, Blackbeard decided to steal fresh years at the Fountain of Youth, which was discovered by conquistador Ponce de León. With the help of Angelica, who was able to learn of the Profane Ritual needed for the Fountain to work, Blackbeard began his search for the Fountain.\n\nPrior to this, at some point after the end of the War Against Piracy, Blackbeard encountered the Black Pearl, a pirate ship in command of Captain Hector Barbossa. Using his sword, Blackbeard brought the rigging of the Black Pearl to life, and used it against Barbossa's crew, who were eventually defeated, though Barbossa managed to escape with the cost of cutting off his own right leg. Blackbeard managed to capture the Black Pearl and added it to his collection of ships in bottles. During one of Blackbeard's later raids on a remote island in the Caribbean, his crew captured a young missionary named Philip Swift in the process. Before Blackbeard had a chance to kill Philip, Angelica stopped him, as she believed that he may be a key to Blackbeard's redemption. Blackbeard allowed the missionary to live but had him lashed onto the mast of the Queen Anne's Revenge.\n\nBefore their search for the Fountain of Youth could continue further, Blackbeard and Angelica had to find Captain Jack Sparrow, someone whom they have heard had been to the Fountain. And so Angelica set out to find Jack and bring him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. Accompanied by the Quartermaster, Angelica went to London to put an elaborate charade that ensured the capture of Jack Sparrow into effect. With the help of Scrum, Angelica, disguised as Jack himself, began to recruit crewmen at a local pub called the Captain's Daughter. Attracted by the rumors of \"Jack Sparrow recruiting a crew\", Jack Sparrow himself went to the Captain's Daughter, where he found Angelica impersonating him. Ultimately, after a duel with Angelica, which ended with an escape from King George's royal guards, Jack was knocked out cold with a voodoo dart by the Quartermaster. Jack was then shanghaied aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, where Blackbeard's quest for the Fountain continued on.\n\nThroughout the first several days on the voyage, at which time Jack Sparrow was out cold from the effects of the voodoo dart or working as a deckhand, Blackbeard stayed in his cabin and never came out. Because of his predicament of being trapped aboard Blackbeard's ship, filled with zombies and sailing to a place of certain death, Jack decided to rally some of the human crewmen in a mutiny. The following night in the gun deck aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jack persuaded the crewmen to join the mutiny by telling them the danger of their destination, which the crew hadn't been informed of, towards finding the Fountain of Youth. The mutiny began well for Jack and his co-conspirators, as they almost took control of the ship with the defeat of Angelica and the zombie officers. However, the doors right behind Jack Sparrow opened and every one of the mutineers stared in abject terror as they saw the looming figure of Edward Teach, better known as the notorious Blackbeard.\n\nSilhouetted against the moonlight, the nightmare of a man came out of his cabin, surrounded by smoke from fuses twined into his black beard. One hand grasped a bottle of whisky. Jack turned away as Blackbeard raised the whisky bottle, drinking it in one long swallow before tossing the bottle away. Speaking to his crew, Blackbeard gripped the jewelled hilt of his sword, at the same time, elsewhere on deck, ropes move on their own accord. Using the powers of his sword, Blackbeard brought the rigging of his ship alive to single-handedly quelled the mutiny with relative ease. Following the mutiny, Blackbeard attempted to kill Jack but was interrupted by young missionary Philip Swift. After an argument between the two if he was afraid or just plain bad, Blackbeard once again intended to shoot Philip, but was again stopped by Angelica. Blackbeard seemed touched that his daughter would go to such lengths to save him. Angelica told him that every soul could be saved, with Philip agreeing to the comment. Because of the faith shown from his daughter, he put away his pistol.\n\nWhen Blackbeard found out from Gunner that the Cook, who was to stood watch that night, was part of the mutiny, he ordered him to go into the longboat. Because of their laws concerning mutiny, Blackbeard had the Queen Anne's Revenge sail to a position where he could unleash Greek fire upon the Cook as an example to the other crewmen. Angelica desperately pleaded for him to not kill the Cook. Blackbeard ignored her plea, saying that he gave him the chance not afforded by all, and ordered his men to fire the cannons. The crew watch as the Cook was blasted by Greek fire as he was rowing away from the Revenge. As the Cook was burned, Blackbeard told Philip that he felt closest to his Maker when he sees suffering, pain and anguish, saying that is when the true design of the world is revealed. Philip tried to convince Blackbeard otherwise and that there was still hope, but Blackbeard ignored him as he again gave the order to fire. The crew of the Revenge watch as the Cook was burned to death.\n\nAfterwards, the Quartermaster took Jack Sparrow to Blackbeard's cabin for a talk, where Blackbeard tried to convince Jack to lead him to the Fountain of Youth. After Sparrow refused, Blackbeard started making a voodoo doll of Jack. As he did, Jack tried to warn Blackbeard of Angelica, saying that she's not his daughter. Though Blackbeard didn't believe him, Jack tried to tell him that she was consummate of the art of deception as well as being pure evil. Angelica entered the cabin as Blackbeard started to stab the finished Jack voodoo doll with a dagger. Sparrow immediately felt heavy pain in his chest and, after Blackbeard put the doll over the fire from a candle, instantly agreed to take a look at the charts.\n\nOne of the items which Blackbeard required for the Profane Ritual at the Fountain was a mermaid's tear, so the Queen Anne's Revenge achored at Whitecap Bay, a mermaid nesting place on a mysterious island. Blackbeard approached the rail, gazing with satisfaction as he saw a remote lighthouse on a distant, rocky shoreline. Several longboats rowed in with the landing party of a dozen pirates, with Blackbeard, Angelica and Jack Sparrow among them. Some of Blackbeard's men deployed the fishing nets in the shallow water as traps for the mermaids, while Blackbeard himself joined the others who made their way to the top of the old lighthouse, where one of his men, Salaman, got it in working condition in order to attract mermaids.\n\nBlackbeard had hatched a plan to catch a mermaid, but he would not do the fishing himself. He handpicked members of his crew for the dangerous job; the ones he could do without. A longboat full of members of Blackbeard's crew were sent on a mission, as bait to lure a mermaid for her tears. Legend has it that man-made light and song attract the sirens of the sea, so the boat is lit by the beam of the lighthouse and Scrum sings a swaying sea shanty. The song soon attracted a group of mermaids, who soon attacked the boats and their crews. The mermaid hunt turned into a massive slaughter, where mermaids attempted to kill all of the men in the boats. Blackbeard then used the powers of his sword to summon the Revenge, which launched heavy Greek fire cannons on the mermaids, forcing them to swim closer to shore.\n\nUsing the long seaweed as whips, the mermaids began to attack the onshore party, pulling them into the sea. As some of the crewmen tried to escape inland, Blackbeard personally shot them, calling them cowards and forcing the rest to stay in the water. Jack Sparrow saw that the mermaids must be driven off, and he climbed to the top of the lighthouse. He burned the whale oil in the lighthouse, creating a big explosion which scared the mermaids and forced them to retreat to the depths.\n\nThough it looked that Blackbeard's mermaid hunt was a failure, with all mermaids on the shore dead, Philip Swift managed to capture one mermaid, stabbing the end of her tail with his cutlass. Blackbeard, whose hatred toward the young missionary was well known, now personally praised him for capturing the creature.\n\nAfter relocating the Queen Anne's Revenge to a protected cove of the island, Blackbeard and his men came inland to continue their quest. They needed to find the Santiago, a ship captained by Ponce de León which was stranded somewhere on the island. The two Chalices of Cartagena, another important item needed for the ritual, were hidden aboard the ship, and Blackbeard had to find them.\n\nJack Sparrow guided them with the help of his mystical compass, but the crew soon discovered an insurmountable obstacle; a broken bridge. Blackbeard decided that one of them will cross the river and retrieve the Chalices, while the rest of the crew will continue towards the Fountain. Blackbeard took Jack's compass and ordered him to jump into the river. When Jack refused to jump from the high cliff, Blackbeard pulled out his pistol and threatened to kill Angelica. Though Sparrow didn't believe that he would kill his own daughter, Blackbeard gave his pistol to the Quartermaster who had placed it with six more pistols, with only two of them being loaded, but not knowing which.\n\nForcing Jack to choose one of them, Blackbeard took the pistol from him and pointed it into Angelica, pulling the trigger. The pistol wasn't loaded, but Blackbeard forced Jack to choose again. When Jack fired loaded pistol into air, he knew that Blackbeard is serious, and he asked the Quartermaster about the possibility of survival if he jumps into the river. The Quartermaster took Jack's voodoo doll, throwing it into the river.\n\nJack screamed, but the Quartermaster assured him that he would survive the jump. When Angelica attempted to jump, Jack jumped before her, falling into the river, and appeared on the surface a moment later. Angelica complimented Blackbeard's method, saying that he knew which pistols were loaded. Blackbeard assured her that he did know and walked away. As Jack proceeded to the Santiago, Blackbeard continued his search for the Fountain.\n\nDuring the journey, the captured mermaid was carried in a glass tank filled with sea water. But when one of his zombie crewmen, Yeoman, accidentally tripped, the tank fell to the ground, breaking. The mermaid fell to the ground, and before the shocked eyes of the pirates, her tail transformed into a pair of human legs. Philip Swift quickly gave her his shirt to cover her nudity. Blackbeard, not wanting to wait, told her to walk, but although she tried, her new legs weren't able to stand up. After Blackbeard threatened her, Philip Swift decided to carry her for the rest of the journey. When Blackbeard found the Jungle Pools and ordered his men to bring the mermaid, referring to her as the \"creature\", Philip demanded she'd be called Syrena.\n\nBlackbeard and his crew arrived to the pools where mermaids had previously been tied up and left to die, harvested for their mermaid tears. Syrena was put into one of the pools while Blackbeard tried to force her to cry by showing the remains of her fellow mermaids and telling her of how they were left to die a slow, painful death. However, Syrena would not yield. So Blackbeard, upon learning that she and Philip fancy each other, decided to use Philip. Realizing that Syrena would remain strong, Blackbeard ordered the Quartermaster to kill Philip, although in reality he only sedated him with a dart. Syrena was seemingly left to die while Philip's body was dumped nearby. Blackbeard and his crew waited until Philip regained consciousness and managed to make Syrena cry with a tear of joy when they were reunited. After getting Syrena's tear in a vial, Blackbeard ordered Syrena to be secured and left at the pools to die, as the mermaids before her.\n\nWith Angelica in the lead, Blackbeard and his crew carried on with their search through the jungles, until they met up with Jack Sparrow. Sparrow was successful in finding the Chalices, which were tied up to a wild boar that was held down by Joshamee Gibbs. However, Jack had conditions to be made before he could hand them over. He wanted Angelica unharmed, the return of his compass, and for Gibbs to be allowed to go free. Annoyed by Jack's blabbering, Blackbeard accepted and took the Chalices from Gibbs, as they continued on their journey.\n\nAfter much searching through the jungles, Jack found the cave entrance to the Fountain of Youth. The Quartermaster led Blackbeard and the rest of the crew as they went down a steep incline to the cavern. Going much deeper inside the blue cave, the Quartermaster waved the torch across a wall, which Jack says it's a dead end. Upon seeing the supposed end of the quest and Jack's unsuccessful attempt to gain entrance into the Fountain by hitting the two Chalices against one another, that Blackbeard and his crew knew that Jack had never been to the Fountain. Angered by this revelation, Blackbeard ordered the Quartermaster to kill Jack. The Quartermaster fired his pistol but Jack shielded himself with the Chalices, ricocheting the bullets off them. Blackbeard aimed his own pistol at Sparrow, who started to read the words inscribed on the Chalices, \"Aqua de Vida\". Suddenly, Blackbeard and his crew heard water coming from the cave, gradually rising up along the walls, collecting into a pool above their heads. Blackbeard watched as Jack climbed onto Scrum's shoulders and poked the pool, before being sucked into it.\n\nBlackbeard and the rest of the crew followed Jack through the pool, and ended up in the Fountain of Youth. As Blackbeard looked around the Fountain's chamber, Jack Sparrow walked further to the Fountain itself, a natural stone archway-like basin with water dripping through. Blackbeard stopped Jack, as he went up to the central stone reaching to touch the water, stating that he'll be the first to drink from it. However, Angelica warned Blackbeard of an unwanted visitor appearing out of the mist. To his dismay, Blackbeard was confronted by the one-legged man who was destined to kill him\u2014Hector Barbossa.\n\nJack had led Barbossa, a privateer in King George's court, and his crew of the HMS Providence to the Fountain to confront Blackbeard. Barbossa declared Blackbeard as his prisoner, at which Blackbeard scoffed. Stating the crimes he had committed, including the loss of his leg, Barbossa pulled out his sword. Blackbeard questioned Barbossa's challenge as he pulled his sword out. Feeling that fate had caught up to him, with his prophesied death coming true, Blackbeard was determined to not go down without a fight. He ordered his crew to attack Barbossa's men. After Jack briefly stopped the fight between the two parties, convincing everyone to let just the captains fight each other, the battle between the crews began as the two captains engage in a fierce duel.\n\nIn their deadlock battle, Blackbeard fought Barbossa, who blocked the attacks with his sword and crutch, while evading Barbossa's own attacks. They continued slashing at each other until one of Barbossa's men, Gillette, got in the way and was fatally stabbed by Blackbeard, briefly interrupting the duel. In one of Barbossa's attacks with his crutch, Blackbeard grabbed it and chopped it in half, leaving Barbossa slightly unbalanced. Blackbeard laughed at the idea that there could have been more of a fight, to which Barbossa retaliated by poking Blackbeard in the face with the remaining half of his crutch, enraging Blackbeard and causing him to fight harder. Despite being at a disadvantage, Barbossa was still able to fight, until Blackbeard tripped the privateer to the ground. To Blackbeard's frustration, Barbossa had a smile on his face, which infuriated him as he was about to finish him off. But Blackbeard wouldn't be given that chance, as Barbossa pointed out to him, as he gazed upon more unwanted visitors.\n\nThe Spaniard and his men appeared out of the fog, slowly stopping the fight at the Fountain. Blackbeard stared in amazement as more Spanish soldiers appeared. Declaring that the Fountain was to be destroyed, the Spaniard smashed the two Chalices and dropped them in a deep pool nearby. Blackbeard watched as the Spanish prepared to destroy the Fountain.\n\nAs the Spanish began destroying the Fountain of Youth, the Spaniard confronted Blackbeard, calling him a fool for seeking what only faith can provide. Blackbeard debunked that claim, saying that for faith there is enough to see, but enough to blind. Suddenly, he staggered forward, feeling a cut on his wrist. As Blackbeard turned around, Hector Barbossa stabbed him through with his sword. Seeing that he was mortally wounded, Angelica ran to her father's side to remove the sword, but cut herself in the process. Barbossa informed them that the blade of his sword was poisoned.\n\nThe Spanish continued destroying the temple around the Fountain. Barbossa walked to pick up Blackbeard's sword, claiming it along with his ship and crew for payment of his lost leg. Despite the destruction of the Fountain of Youth, Jack Sparrow managed to retrieve the Chalices\u2014with help from Syrena\u2014and was able to get the last few drops from the Fountain and added the mermaid's tear into one of the Chalices. Jack presented both Chalices to Blackbeard and Angelica, saying that one of them must sacrifice themselves.\n\nAngelica offered the Chalice with the tear to Blackbeard, while Jack tried to convince him to save his daughter by letting her drink the cup with the tear. Blackbeard, however, just took the Chalice with the tear and drank from it, telling Angelica to save him. Though saddened by what her own father did, Angelica drank the other Chalice. However, Jack revealed that he may have mixed up the Chalices.\n\nHaving lost his chance at eternal life, Blackbeard tried to attack Sparrow, but staggered, being stuck standing in the same spot. As Angelica's wound healed, the flowing waters of the Fountain rushed towards Blackbeard, completely surrounding and entwining him, rotting away his body. Angelica stared in horror as his skin dissolved, leaving nothing but bones, nothing was left but a standing skeleton. However, Blackbeard's will was strong enough for one last, sad, reach for Angelica until his bones loosen and fell. The Fountain's waters cleared as Blackbeard's lifeless skeleton joined the other victims of previous expeditions, a few bones separating and clattering away, dead.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Blackbeard"}}

One night, he would join a group of pirates as the Auctioneer led an auction on two wenches, Scarlett and Giselle. Throughout the bid, many of the pirates bidded on Scarlett, referring to her as the \"redhead\". As soon as Scarlett and Giselle started showing off for bids, Nigel bidded ten pieces of silver for Giselle, referring to her as the \"one with the flaxen hair\". Nigel later brought his goat into the bid, though Slurry Gibson reminded him that he loved that goat. The bidding ultimately ended with the Marquis D'avis winning the bid with seven hundred and two goats.\n\nThere was soon an argument, which ended with a pirate named Mungard firing his pistol accidentally hitting the Pirate Code. The Auctioneer, still holding the Code, fell backwards to the ground. Everyone, including Nigel, stared in shock of what just happened. Nigel and the other pirates whisper among themselves about Mungard shooting the Code. It was then that Mungard ordered the Code to be locked up and warned the crowd of pirates that if any of them spoke a word of what occurred, that he would have their tongues.\n\nNigel's further fate is unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Nigel"}}

He was also worshiped in Egypt where he was known as Maahes. His mother was Sekhmet, the lion goddess. He had the appearance of a human with the head of a lion.\n\nAround 1300 BC, Apedemak instructed the citizens of Kerma to leave their homes and travel to the West. Kermans took their most sacred possesion, the green stone of power, and crossed the Great Desert, finally reaching the Atlantic Ocean. There, they built ships and sailed until they found an uninhabited island. They settled on the island and named it Kerma, in honor of their old city. Kermans built the city which they named Zerzura, and the temple for their god. The green stone was placed in the labyrinth beneath the temple, and became known as the Heart of Zerzura.\n\nThanks to the power of the Heart, Kerma remained isolated from the outside world, hidden by the magical fog. In the 1720s, on Apedemak's advice, the ruler of Kerma, Pharaoh Taharka, left the island so he could find the cure for his ill son, Prince Aniba. Taharka obtained the cure from the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma, but his ship was attacked and captured by the infamous rogue pirates led by Christophe-Julien de Rapièr. The Pharaoh was mortally wounded during the battle, and Apedemak sent him a man to whom he could give his magical wristlet, Jack Sparrow. But the wristlet was stolen by Christophe.\n\nFive years later, Jack, Christophe, and Taharka's daughter Amenirdis were on Kerma, where they entered the labyrinth beneath Apedemak's temple. Christophe attempted to cheat Jack Sparrow and steal the heart of Zerzura, but Apedemak himself intervened, transformed into a lion. The rogue pirate escaped, thinking that the Heart is in his bag, but he was tricked into taking a large rock instead. Amenirdis then thanked her god for saving her life and the life of her lover, Jack Sparrow.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/pirates.wikia.com\/wiki\/Apedemak"}}
