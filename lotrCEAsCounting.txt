He sits next to Aragorn until they all stand up to argue. After Frodo shouts \"I will take it!\" and everyone turns and looks at him, Figwit is standing on the far right. He is standing in the background for only a fraction of a second; thus few know who he is. \n\nFigwit is also seen in the third movie in the scene where Arwen is leaving for the Grey Havens and has the vision about her future son Eldarion. Figwit is the elf that tells her to continue with the others. His exact words: \"Lady Arwen, we cannot delay\" and then \"My lady!\"\n\nFigwit's rise to fame began shortly after the first movie. Peter Jackson stated in the DVD commentary for ROTK that he was given dialog in the third movie because Jackson became aware of the attention given to this extra. Jackson mentions the phenomenon in the commentary track on the extended version of the Return of the King DVD: \"the decision to give him a speaking role was developed after the scene was scripted. Originally just a random cast extra was to give the lines, but it was decided that it would be fun if the Figwit actor was brought in to deliver them.\"\n\nFigwit does not appear in any of the books and was created exclusively by Peter Jackson. Because of this, there is little authentic information regarding Figwit, save that he was an escort (Peter Jackson refers to the name \"Figwit\" in one of the commentaries of Return of the King). The only 'official' place where the name \"Figwit\" actually appears is on a Return of the King series card from Topps #38 - \"Return to Rivendell\". The front of the card features a profile view of Figwit with the back text reading: \"Front: The Elf Figwit (Bret McKenzie) reminds her that they must go on the ships, but the determined Arwen simply rides off without explanation.\"  Figwit's card in the Lord of the Rings collectable card game gives his name as Aegnor, the name of one of Galadriel's brothers in the Silmarillion.\n\n\"Figwit\" is played by Bret McKenzie (son of actor Peter McKenzie, who played Elendil in the first film) and is credited simply as \"Elf Escort\" in The Return of the King.\n\nIn 2004, a 50 minute documentary on the Figwit phenomenon \"Frodo is great... Who is that?!!\" was made by three Wellington filmmakers Stan Alley, Nick Booth and Hannah Clarke - all of whom worked on the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The documentary follows Bret McKenzie to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and \"elvish good looks\" and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites as well as Peter Jackson, Barry Osbourne, Mark Ordesky, Ian McKellen and other cast members.\n\nBret McKenzie returns in The Hobbit trilogy, playing the role of the Elf Lindir. McKenzie himself stated that he believed the two roles of Figwit and Lindir are two separate Elves, due to their different costumes, ears and hairstyles.\n\nThe name \"Figwit\" is an acronym for \"Frodo is great; who is that?\"\n\nFigwit has become a popular character in fanfiction. However, many authors decided that \u201CFigwit\u201D didn\u2019t sound nearly elvish enough. So they did their best to translate his name into an elvish language. They split it up, and combined the literal translation of \u201Cfig\u201D (in Quenyan, \u201Cmelpo\u201D) and clever or skilled; \u201Cwit\" (in Noldorin, \u201Cmaen\u201D), and thus started using the name \u201CMelpomaen\u201D for his character\n\nHis decipher card gives the name Aegnor, a name derived from The Silmarillion\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Figwit"}}

They took to pillaging and piracy along the coasts of Gondor, but in TA 933 Umbar was conquered by Gondor; however Umbar was besieged by the Black Númenóreans and Haradrim until TA 1050, when the siege was over after being defeated by King Hyarmendacil I of Gondor.\n\nDuring the Kin-strife, the defeated rebels of Gondor fled to Umbar, being called Corsairs, most of them being Dúnedain. At this time Umbar became the hated enemy of Gondor, from TA 1448 to TA 1810. Over time these sailors drew to their number various outlaws and brigands from outlying settlements surrounding the Anduin, and they took to raiding along the southern coast of Gondor, intercepting merchant vessels and abducting women to bolster their dissident community. They were also slavers and would often seize a ship's crew along with her cargo; if any resisted, they would be thrown overboard.\n\nIn TA 1810 Gondor retook Umbar, but shortly after, in TA 1846, Umbar was lost to Haradrim and new Corsairs emerged. Since then and by the time of the War of the Ring, the Corsairs had mixed with the Southrons, becoming a mixed people where Númenórean blood was mostly gone.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring at the time of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, a Corsair fleet on route to Harlond after overrunning Pelargir with intentions of further raids on Gondor and to aid the forces of Mordor in the battle. Aragorn, with the help of the Grey Company, Legolas, Gimli, and the Army of the Dead, drove the Corsairs off and captured their ships and rowed them to Minas Tirith to relieve the siege of the city. In that battle, the Dead fulfilled their oath to Isildur and were finally able to rest in peace.\n\nThe Corsairs sailed in large, dark, wooden galley ships with large black junk-like sails.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the Corsairs are seen once, for only a few seconds, when Gandalf is talking to Pippin about who will fight for Sauron in the battle for Minas Tirith. The boats are also seen in a scene in the extended version, when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli send the Army of the Dead to attack the frightened corsairs (including Peter Jackson himself, in a cameo as a Corsair) and conquer the ships.\n\nIn the game The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, there are a few Goblins and Goblin Drummers that appear in the Anduin River: Anduin Banks level along with the Corsairs.\n\nIn the campaign of The Battle for Middle-earth II, the Corsairs, in Campaign Mode, join forces with the Goblins led by Gorkil and launch an assault upon the Grey Havens. While the attack fails in the Good Campaign, in the Evil Campaign the conjoined attack is completely successful, and thanks to the armada brought forth by the Corsairs the Grey Havens are destroyed. Also, the special unit recruitable at captured Inns for the Goblins is the corsairs.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II the Corsairs use daggers as their primary weapon. They are stronger than typical Orcs and like to stab their enemies. They also use firebombs which, while not much more powerful than their daggers and able to cause a friendly fire, can set their enemies ablaze or do some significant damage nonetheless. In the film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring they have ballistas mounted on their ships.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Corsairs_of_Umbar"}}

He was a great warrior, and as the heir of Isildur bore the shards of Narsil, reforged and renamed Andúril, in the War of the Ring.","Elrond revealed to \"Estel\" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil. Elrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he \"came of the right\" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of Lórien where she had visited her grandmother Galadriel.","While Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli went to Rohan to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by the Uruk-hai working for Saruman.","Together, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where Gandalf freed Théoden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize the Rohirrim against Saruman. He allied with Théoden and led the refugees to Helm's Deep.","In order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the Paths of the Dead, and summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the King of Gondor. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that the Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying Gondor a millennia before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were defeated.","Upon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was crowned as King Elessar, a name given to him by Galadriel. He became the twenty-sixth King of Arnor, thirty-fifth King of Gondor and the first High King of the Reunited Kingdom, though it would be several years before his authority was firmly reestablished in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of Telcontar (Telcontar being Quenya for \"Strider\"). Aragorn married Arwen shortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120 of the Fourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity within Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and communication between Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous rebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the Reunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and Haradrim, re-establishing rule over much territory that Gondor had lost in previous centuries. \n During his coronation, Aragorn sang Elendil's Oath: \"Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!\" (\"Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.\")","When in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, King Elessar realised his days were at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street. He said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion his crown and sceptre. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died. Shortly a year after Aragorn died, Arwen soon died of a broken heart. Eldarion began his reign as the Second King of the Reunited Kingdom after his father's and mother's death.","The name Aragorn means \"Revered King\", from the Sindarin ara (\"king\") and (n)gorn (\"revered\").. Aragorn was named after Aragorn I.","As king, Aragorn has many titles:","Aragorn's sword is Andúril, Flame of the West, the reforged sword Narsil, Elendil's blade that Isildur used to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Aragorn uses it with the same skill the Numenoreans had long ago.","The restoration of the line of Elendil to the throne of Gondor is a subplot of The Lord of the Rings; Aragorn's adventures not only aid Frodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which, though his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to historical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of Gondor have been under the rule of the Stewards of Gondor for centuries, as it was widely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. Shortly after Isildur's departure, Meneldil, son of Anárion, had severed Gondor from Arnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with the northern line (as Isildur was Elendil's eldest son). This arrangement had been reinforced by the Steward Pelendur in nearly 2,000 years before when he rejected Arvedui's claim to the Throne of Gondor during a Gondorian succession crisis (Eärnil, a member of the House of Anárion, was eventually chosen as King instead). It is worth noting, however, that Arvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had married a descendant of Anárion: thus, Aragorn was technically a descendant of not only Elendil and Isildur but of Anárion as well.","Another suggestion was that Trotter was \"Fosco Took (Bilbo's first cousin), who vanished when a lad, owing to Gandalf\". This story was further elaborated, making Trotter a nephew of Bilbo, named Peregrin Boffin, and an elder cousin of Frodo. He was said to have run away after he came of age, some twenty years before Bilbo's party, and had helped Gandalf in tracking Gollum later. A hint was also given as to why Trotter wore wooden shoes: he had been captured by the Dark Lord in Mordor and tortured, but saved by Gandalf; a note was added by Tolkien in the margin, saying that it would later be revealed that Trotter had wooden feet.","The first mention of Elrond's daughter, named Arwen Undomiel, was in reference to the banner which she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not give any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references to her marriage with Aragorn were made later, but it was explicitly stated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working on the appendices for The Lord of the Rings that Tolkien recorded the full tale of Aragorn and Arwen.","Tolkien hesitated for some time about Trotter's \"real\" name. Although Aragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled, it was changed a number of times. At one point Tolkien decided that an Elvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aragorn via Elfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing- representing \"west\". Later, however, a new plot element was introduced: Galadriel's gift of a green stone, and Tolkien reverted the usage to Elfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained into the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a translation of Elessar.","Richard J. Finn presented a paper entitled \"Arthur and Aragorn - Arthurian Influence in LOTR at the Forty-First International Congress on Medieval Studies\". The are additional similarities between Aragorn and Arthur beyond those pointed out by Finn. Arthur is descended from Kings of Goddodin - Coel Hen, Aragorn becomes King of Gondor. Kings of the period in Goddodin lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh, still known as Dùn Éideann in Scottish Gaelic) remarkably similar to Dúnadan. For \"Men of the North\", Goddodin was a far northern kingdom. Arthur was crowned by St. Dubriticus, who wore a long gray robe for which he was called \"His Grey Eminence\" - Gandalf the White also wore a gray robe at Aragorn's coronation to indicate he at one time was Gandalf the Grey.","In order to ensure safe passage across Mordor for Frodo to fulfill his quest, Aragorn then led the Army of the West out from Minas Tirith to make a diversionary feint on the Black Gate of Mordor itself in the Battle of the Morannon. Gandalf had been given supreme command of the war effort after the Pelennor Fields, and acted as chief spokesman in the parley with the Mouth of Sauron; but Aragorn commanded the Allied troops during the battle and its aftermath.","In \"The Two Towers\" and \"Return of the King\" video games, Aragorn's missile weapon is his bow and arrows. In each case, Aragorn has 30 arrows.","While not appearing physically in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy, he is alluded to by Thranduil to Legolas in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. In a departure from the books, he is stated to already be a Ranger and well known among his people, rather than a ten year old child. Thranduil only told him that the Ranger's name was Strider and that he was the son of Arathon, telling him that he would have to find out Strider's true name for himself.","Aragorn was voiced by John Hurt in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film version of The Lord of the Rings. Bakshi's Aragorn, unlike all other portrayals that were to follow to date, has no beard. This actually conforms to a statement appearing in Unfinished Tales that implicitly says that Aragorn was not supposed to have one, due to his Elvish ancestry (Elves did not grow beards). In a note written in 1972 or later, among the last writings of my father's on the subject of Middle-earth, there is a discussion of the Elvish strain in Men, as to its being observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended (it was a characteristic of all Elves to be beardless. However, Tolkien actually wrote elsewhere that Elves did have beards; in The Lord of the Rings itself Círdan is described as having a beard. Also, some viewers and critics have said that this version of Aragorn looks Native American though not necessarily to the detriment of the film.","Aragorn was voiced by Theodore Bikel in the 1980 Rankin\/Bass animated version of The Return of the King, made for television. He first appears at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, leading the reinforcements from southern Gondor.","Aragorn was portrayed by Evan Buliung in the three-hour production of The Lord of the Rings, which opened in 2006 in Toronto, Canada.","In the fan-film Born of Hope, Aragorn appears as a two-year-old toddler played by the child actor Luke Johnston.","Robert Stephens voiced the character in the 1981 BBC Radio serial of The Lord of the Rings.","Aragorn appears in LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game and its associated toy line, LEGO The Lord of the Rings, as a minifigure; Viggo Mortenson once again voices him through archived audio recordings."],"name":"Aragorn II Elessar","description":"Tolkien gives a brief but detailed description of him in The Lord of the Rings: lean, dark, tall, with \"a shaggy head of dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.\"\n\nIn The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen, he was said to be often grim and sad, with unexpected moments of levity. Some time after the publications of the books, Tolkien wrote that he was six feet six inches tall.\n\nAragorn possessed Elven wisdom due to his childhood in Rivendell with Elrond and the foresight of the Dúnedain. He was also a skilled healer, notably with the plant Athelas (also known as Kingsfoil). He was also a mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, he, Éomer, and Imrahil were said to be left unscathed, even though they had been in the thick of the fighting.\n\nThough there is no indication of his ever doubting his role and destiny as the future king of the Reunited Kingdom and one of the leaders of the war against Sauron (as he did in Peter Jackson's film), he was not immune to self-doubt, as he doubted the wisdom of his decisions while leading the Fellowship after the loss of Gandalf in Moria, and blamed himself for many of their subsequent misfortunes.\n\nOn one occasion, his pride (or reverence for his heritage) led to complications, as he refused to disarm and leave his sword Andúril (a priceless heirloom of Númenor and one of the weapons which slew Sauron) at the door of Edoras, as Théoden had required, and only did so after Gandalf left his own sword (also of high lineage) behind. Even so, he swore that death would come to anyone else who touched it (whether by his own hand or by some magic, it is left unsaid).\n\nHe also appeared to possess a nigh-indomidable will. At one point, he was able to psychically challenge Sauron for control of the Palantir of Orthanc, and proved victorious in that struggle. It should be noted that even Gandalf the White was reluctant to use the Palantir for fear of challenging Sauron directly and revealing himself to the Dark Lord. He was accounted as \"the hardiest of living Men\" during his lifetime.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Aragorn_II_Elessar"}}

Náin stood before the Gate, and in his wrath he cried with a great voice for Azog to come out and face him. Finally Azog appeared, fresh and fully armed, and the two fought. Náin withstood Azog's assault until, blinded by his great rage, he swung a great stroke with all his strength at Azog.

He was portrayed by New Zealand actor Lawrence Makoare in the first film, Fellowship of the Ring, in which he kills Boromir, and is later slain by Aragorn.","Lurtz was the first of Saruman's Uruk-hai to be bred, choking the first Orc he sees to death within seconds of his birth. Attempting to intervene, other Orcs (Snaga) move towards the newly born Uruk-hai warrior, but Saruman halts their advance, intrigued by the malice and violence present in the Uruk's blood, leaving the unfortunate Orc to its fate. He became Saruman's second-in-command, and led the first battalion of Uruk-hai into battle against the Fellowship of the Ring at Amon Hen. Lurtz was born from the first batch of Uruk-hai in Isengard's pits (possibly even the first ever as an experiment), and so was far more developed, smarter, and stronger than the later troops which were bred more quickly, presumably so Saruman could amass an army as fast as possible. Given that he gave orders to the other Uruk-Hai Scouts at the Amon Hen and that he was given private audience with Saruman, he could presumably be called the strongest, smartest and most loyal of all of Saruman's Uruk-hai warriors.","As his soldiers grab Merry and Pippin, Lurtz slowly approaches Boromir to finish him off. Before Lurtz can send the final arrow to Boromir's heart, Aragorn intervenes, tackling Lurtz to the ground and both engage in a brutal fight.","In the LEGO Game Battle of Helm's Deep, a Lurtz microfigure was given, and which it states as \"Uruk-Hai Leader\". Besides, in LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game, there is a playable character which is named \"Lurtz(Newborn)\".","Lurtz's name is never spoken aloud in the original film; it is only known from the franchise and credits. However, in the extended edition of the film, Lurtz's name is spoken by Saruman. Despite some initial fears that he was an entirely new character, he really wasn't much different from other 'generic Orc leaders' already present in the book."],"name":"Lurtz","description":"Out of all Uruk-Hai bred in Isengard, Lurtz is possibly the smartest, bravest and most capable leader. He is highly intelligent, extremely violent and blindly loyal to Saruman. He has an incredibly high tolerance for pain, as shown during his fight with Aragorn. He appears utterly ignorant to the loss of a limb, a stab wound, and several other wounds. He also goes so far as to violently headbutt his opponent. He will do absolutely anything to outfight his adversaries, including allowing himself to be impaled just to gain a proximity advantage. In the BFME games, he is depicted smashing his head on an enemy or structure as an attack, further proving his resilience to pain. He is also very sadistic, laughing whilst pinning down Boromir.\n\nHe was a highly skilled swordsman, given he was the leader of the Uruk-hai pack. He had an unorthodox and brutal fighting style that emphasises swordsmanship with long-range attacks and brawling moves. A prime example of his duelling skills is that he was able to hold his own against Aragorn, managing to keep up with him for a relatively short period of time, landing several blows upon the Ranger and even making him bleed. However, he was eventually overpowered and slain by Aragorn due to the latter's superior skill and technique. Lurtz was also a skilled archer, as shown when he mortally wounded Boromir with three arrows to the chest while the latter was engaged in combat with other Uruks.\n\nThe character of Lurtz is one of the playable \"heroes\" for the Isengard faction in the computer game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, and the sequel The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, as well as a boss in the console game adaptions of The Two Towers, and ironically doesn't appear in any of The Fellowship of the Ring video games. He also appears as a playable character in the video game The Lord of the Rings: Conquest and Lego: Lord of the Rings after he is unlocked.\n\nLurtz also makes an appearance in the GBA Game The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age as a playable hero for the forces of evil.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lurtz"}}

He invited Frodo, along with Sam Gamgee and Pippin Took, to spend the night in the Elves' company.","In The Silmarillion, it is stated that Finrod had no wife, since he loved Amarië of the Vanyar, who refused to go with him to the exile. This means that he could only have a son after he died in Middle-earth, and went to the Halls of Mandos. He might have been resurrected by Mandos, and then married Amarië. It is very unlikely (probably impossible), however, that he would be allowed to return to Middle-earth. The only such instance would be Glorfindel, and it is doubtful that if that was the case, there would be no mention of it in Tolkien's writings. Furthermore, Gildor wouldn't describe himself as one of the Exiles."],"name":"Gildor Inglorion","description":"To the Hobbits, Gildor and the Elves appeared to shimmer as they walked through the night. The starlight glimmered in their hair and eyes. They camped in a clearing in the Woody End near Woodhall and the elves provided the Hobbits with bread and fruit and a fragrant drink.\n\nFrodo stayed up late talking to Gildor. They talked of the many dangers that the Hobbits might soon face. Frodo had greeted Gildor by saying, \"Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo\" (A star shines upon the hour of our meeting) impressed with his knowledge of the ancient tongue and lore he commended Frodo and named him Elf-friend. Gildor perceived that the Enemy was seeking for Frodo, though he did not know why. He was reluctant to give Frodo any advice in Gandalf's absence.\n\nGildor then advised Frodo to leave quickly and to take with him friends he could trust and to flee from the Nazgûl. He also promised to send out word to Elves and others to be on the lookout for Frodo and help him on his journey. Gildor was true to his word, for both Tom Bombadil and Aragorn heard of Frodo's peril from Gildor. Word also reached Rivendell, and Glorfindel rode out to find Aragorn and the Hobbits as they were pursued by the Nazgûl from Weathertop.\n\nGildor and the Elves continued on their way. Gildor had told Frodo they were tarrying in Middle-earth before heading to the Grey Havens to pass over the Sea to the Undying Lands. Where they wandered is not known, but on September 22, 3021, Gildor and Frodo met once again in the same spot in the Woody End where they had met three years earlier. Along with Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf, they journeyed to Grey Havens and together they departed over the Sea into the West.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gildor_Inglorion"}}

When the Vala Oromë found the Elves during his travels in Middle-earth, he loved them and urged them to travel with him to Valinor to see its wondrous beauty. The Elves however, were suspicious of this call and were afraid and so Oromë chose ambassadors to represent the three Elven-kindreds: the Vanyar, the Ñoldor, & the Teleri, to represent their kindreds and to return and report what they had saw. One of them was Finwë who along with Ingwë and Elwë went to the Blessed Realm with Oromë. When they returned, they were able to convince the Elves to go on the Great Journey into the far West.\n\nThere was great friendship between Finwë of the Ñoldor and Elwë of the Teleri. Then each became leaders of their own Elven-kindred. Thus, Finwë became the Lord of the Ñoldor who led his people on the Great Journey. And eventually, Finwë and his people the Ñoldor arrived in Valinor directly behind the Vanyar. There he and his people settled and Finwë thus became the First High King of the Ñoldor.\n\nFinwë started a family first marrying Míriel Serindë who had also come with her people the Ñoldor to Aman. They had a son called Fëanor but her labors in giving birth to him drained her of most of her life, and she died shortly after bearing him. After a period of mourning he married again. His second wife was Indis of the Vanyar. Indis bore him four children: Fingolfin, Finarfin, Findis, and Irimë.\n\nWhen Melkor, now free from the Halls of Mandos began spreading lies amongst the Ñoldor attempting to corrupt them, Finwë attempted to moderate his people and lead them back to the Valar. But it was too late, the Ñoldor had already begun to envision for themselves plans and new dominions they could have ruled back in Middle-earth and were proud. However, Fëanor mistrusted the Valar and believed the lies and began to horde his treasures and would only allow his beloved father or his sons to see the Silmarils. He also begun to suspect his half-brother was trying to usurp him as the favored son, and made trouble in Tirion drawing his sword on Fingolfin. For this he was banished from the city, but Finwë loved his elder son greatly and shared his exile and went with him northward and built the city\/fortress of Formenos.\n\nThere Finwë lived with his son and his grandchildren and some of the rest of his house. Later, when Fëanor was summoned to Valmar to make peace with his brother, Finwë did not go out of bitterness over the exile of his son nor did he wish to meet the rest of his people because he no longer felt like their king. There he was the first to be killed in Valinor when Melkor slew him at the doors of Formenos seeking the Silmarils.

Upon hearing of Yazneg's failure to kill the Dwarf leader, Azog makes an example of the Orc by picking him up off the ground by his throat and throwing him to the Wargs, where he is torn apart and killed. Fimbul the Hunter then succeeds Yazneg as Azog's right hand.\n\nAn official LEGO Hobbit line webpagedescribes the character thusly: \"A brute Orc who has perfected all the wits and charms that come with that title. Red-eyed and mean as a devil, Yazneg pummels all creatures great and small that have the misfortune to cross his path.\"\n\nThere is a discrepancy between the Lego set Attack of the Wargs, which contains the model of Yazneg, and the movie The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey on which the LEGO set is based\n\nThe LEGO model of Yazneg appears in a LEGO set depicting a scene in the movie where the Heroes are trapped in pine trees and use magically enchanted pine cones as fire grenades. However, in the movie the character of Yazneg was killed prior to this scene. Additionally, the LEGO model of Yazneg rides a white Warg, which the character of Azog is normally associated with. The meaning of this was revealed in Weta Digital's Making of Azog. Yazneg was originally intended to be the leader of the Warg Riders. But, Jackson decided to change the character to the 7-foot tall pale Orc, Azog, late in the filming. The Lego set was created while Yazneg was still the leader.\n\nYazneg was played by the actor John Rawls.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yazneg"}}

They were ruled by Naugladur of Nogrod. They are the kins of the Indrafangs (Longbeards)."],"name":"Nauglath","description":"The earliest known legends suggest that Melkor created the Úvanimor, bred from the earth, who were monsters, Giants, Ogres, and the Naugleth.The Dwarves appear to be one of the Uvanimor related to Goblins. Fangli\/Fankil\/Fukil (perhaps Sauron), the child of Melkor and his servant, entered into the world perverting men. They fought the Ilkorins (elves). The Ermon allied with Nuin at the Battle of Palisor. Fangli's forces were either defeated, but some may have fled away becoming wild and savage tribes who worshiped Fangli and Melkor. Thereafter Pelisor was possessed by Fangli and his hosts of Naugleth (or Dwarves). Later Fankil with the Dwarves and Goblins went among Men, and bred estrangement between them and the elves; and many Men aided the Dwarves. Such that only the Ermon alone stood by the fairies in the first war of Goblins and Elves (aka Dwarves and Men).\n\nThe Nauglath were the kin of the Indrafangs (the \"Longbeards\"). They are a strange race, and none knew exactly where they came from. They served neither Melkor nor Manwë, and they had no concern for Elves or men. Some claim they had not heard of Ilúvatar, or in hearing disbelieve. In crafts and sciences and in the knowledge of virtues of all things in the earth or under the water none excel them; yet they dwelt beneath the ground in caves and tunneled towns; Nogrod was the mightiest of these. It is said they are very old, and that no child comes among them, nor are they able to laugh. They are squat ins stature, and yet are strong, and their beards reach to their toes. However, the beards of the Indrafangs are the longest of all, forked, and they bound them to their middles as they walked abroad. All these creatures have Men called dwarves, and they say that crafts and cunning surpass that of the Gnomes (Noldor elves), there is however little beauty in their works. It is said that some of the Gnomes joined in league with the Dwarves of Nogrod. The Dwarves were freely in trade with the Noldoli selling swords, coats of mail, and other smithwork of great skill. There was a great traffic between the people, and also with the Orcs and soldiers of Melko as well.\n\nThe dwarves desired the gold of the elves, and asked the king to allow them to work their craft on their treasuries. It was agreed under the guidance of Ufedhin the Noldoli (and his own craft skill), that the gold and one of the Silmarils would be loaned to the dwarves in Norgrod to work their skills on. To which the Dwarves claimed they would fashion things for the adornment of the king and queen such that they had never seen, nor any Gnome or Dwarf had made yet.\n\nThe king broke his agreement with Ufedhin and the dwarves, capturing them. Telling them they would remain hostages until the treasures had been returned to his halls. He mistrusted them and thought they were thieves, or that their greed would turn them into thieves. In place of Ufedhin the gold was brought to Nogrod by one of the craftsmen's companions. Meanwhile Ufedhin manipulated the king with descriptions of the treasures they would make, and began to weave dark plots in order to ensnare the king in avarice and revenge for his capture.\n\nIn these legends, Mîm the fatherless is the captain of the guard of Glorund the Drake (later known as Glauring) one of the greater minions of Melkor. Mîm is put in charge of guarding the great dragon's treasure in his absence. Following Glorund's death by Turin, Turin comes to Glauring's hoard. Mîm uses dark spells to curse the treasures so that no others may touch it without troubles following them. Turin smites him soon after the curse, and takes the treasures back with him to Doriath.\n\nSo different were the early versions of the dwarves in Tolkien's early writings that he ended up turning the Nauglith (as a whole) into a new race; the 'petty Dwarves' to distinguish the people of Mim from Durin's Folk and their peers, the kindred of the Seven Houses of the dwarves.\n\nThe locations of the Longbeards also were switched at a later point to Nogrod instead of Belegost. With the other clan later (Broadbeams) switched to Belegost.\n\nIt's not entirely clear whether Nautar means the same thing as Nauglath. However, it may be possible that Nautar is the clan name, and Nauglath is the race name incorporating both the Nautar and the Indravangs. But since Nauglath is used as the name of the entire race and when talking about those of Nogrod, this is not clear.\n\nSome elements of the stories of the Nauglath is reintroduced in Beren and Lúthien (2017) though the term does not appear (other than in the term \"Nauglafring\").\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Nauglath"}}

Túrin also gave Sador the elven knife that he received for his birthday. Sador would craft carvings of men, beasts, and other things, and teach Túrin morals.\n\nMorwen, Húrin's wife, was not fond of Sador. She said that he did not work fast, and spent too much time \"on trifles unbidden\". However, Húrin was moved by Túrin's pity for Sador, and gave him the task of carving a chair for his hall.\n\nBefore the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin left to go to war. Sador began serving Morwen. Sador did not fight in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and was dismayed that he could not do so, and \"die a valiant death.\" When Túrin left to go to Doriath he first talked to Sador. Sador talked with Túrin about the necessity of his departure. Túrin was sad, but understood. Sador urged him to take back the elven knife. Túrin refused, saying that he would get many things like it in Doriath.\n\nSador stayed in the house of Morwen for a long while but after the loss of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he was enslaved by the Easterlings just like the rest of the Men of Dor-lómin. After thirty years, Túrin returned from Doriath and Nargothrond, now a very tall man. Sador (who was now old) met Túrin at Aerin's house, and participated in a rebellion against the Easterlings (led by Brodda) that had taken over the area. During the uprising, Sador was fatally wounded by the enemy. He was, however, able to say his final words to Túrin before perishing.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sador"}}

He and his folk were the first of Mankind to encounter the Ñoldor of Beleriand when King Finrod Felagund happened upon their camp in Ossiriand in the year FA 310. After years of wandering westwards in search of the High Elves (or the Valar, of whom the Bëorians had heard rumor from the lesser elves they had met in the east), Bëor was eager to establish good relations with Felagund, and the two strove to understand each other. The language barrier was not a major problem due to the similarities between the tongue of the Bëorians, which had been influenced by the elves they had met earlier, and the Sindarin tongue. In the tongue of his people, called Taliska, Bëor was named 'Balan'. The name he is more commonly called by, Bëor was actually the Taliska word for 'vassal', which he earned in the service of Felagund.\n\nBëor and his people settled first in Ossiriand, but were at odds with the Green-elves that already dwelt there, for the men competed with the elves for food and natural resources. Therefore, on the advice of Felagund, Bëor led his people to Estolad, the encampment, in the realm of Amrod and Amras, sons of Fëanor. There the people of the first house became more numerous and were enriched by the teachings of the Eldar. Bëor, however, was not content and wanted to leave Estolad and enter instead into the service of King Felagund. He committed the rule of his people to Baran, his son, and departed with Felagund to his realm of Nargothrond. There Bëor continued his service with Felagund, and he returned never to Estolad. He died in the year 355 of the First Age at the age ninety-three, having spent 44 years in the service of Felagund. His death was greatly lamented by King Finrod and his people, who witnessed for the first time the Gift of Men: death. But in the end Bëor gave up his life willingly and died in peace, a thing previously unheard of by the elves, who wondered much at the strange lives of men.\n\nBëor was held among the Wise of the Edain, and was revered by many among the Eldar. He laid the foundations for cooperation between the Eldar and the Edain in years to come and was the forefather of such heroic figures as Barahir, his son Beren Camlost, Túrin Turambar, Tuor his cousin, and Eärendil the Mariner, son of Tuor.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/B%C3%ABor"}}

Her early life is not well recorded but it is known that she and her family was always close to the Gamgees, and her brothers frequently swam in the Bywater Pool as youths with the Gamgees including Sam. Being very close friends with Sam, she expected that she and him would eventually marry, and expecting a marriage proposal soon she didn't like it when she heard Sam had left the Shire, apparently for Crickhollow.

Berethor, along with Hadhod, Morwen, and Idrial, also appear in the EA's The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth II as pre-made custom heroes."],"name":"Berethor","description":"Before he jumped into the adventure of The Third Age, Berethor was the captain of the guard of Gondor, the twin brother of Beregond, also a captain of Gondor. He fought with Boromir and Faramir in Osgiliath and fled together with them. Called unworthy to fight for Gondor, he was banished by the Steward of Gondor, Denethor. After Boromir left for Rivendell, Berethor went after him...\n\nDuring the adventure, Berethor will get new weapons and skills, and he falls in love with Idrial, (an Elf-maiden of Lothlórien). They meet a few other soldiers and kinsmen who join them, including a Dúnedain Ranger named Elegost, and a Dwarf Warrior from Erebor named Hadhod. He gets to know more and more about his (and his companions') past. Then, Berethor meets a Rohirrim shield-maiden named Morwen. Again Berethor falls in love, this to the frustration of Idrial. Finally, he meets Eaoden, a spearman in Theoden's Royal Guard. At the end, Berethor will go with Morwen to start their own adventure. However, it is possible that Berethor, along with the rest of his company, died at the end of the game. The final battle was with Sauron, atop Barad-dûr. The cutscene after the battle showed Barad-dûr collapsing. It is possible that the company was still atop the tower when it was destroyed, and Aragorn tells Berethor that they were to march upon the Black Gate, a short time before the ring was destroyed. And with Barad-dûr being over 5000 feet tall, they would have had no time to escape the tower.\n\nAt the start of The Third Age, the player follows the journey of Berethor, as he follows Boromir to Rivendell. While Boromir sits at the council, Berethor is ambushed by a group of Nazgûl, who were probably seeking to assail Boromir. Berethor fights bravely, but is overcome and wounded by the Nazgûl. Before they can deliver the killing blow, however, Idrial rushes to his aid, subduing the Nazgûl with water magic. She then revives him with a gift of the elves, after which Berethor declares himself in her debt. They then set off to an elven way-station to heal his wounds and equip him for the long road ahead...\n\nIn the mountain pass, Berethor and his elven companion came upon a ranger called Elegost. After clearing the pass full of Wargs and Orcs, they set upon a quest to track down a mordor orc and his band, who stole a map from Elegost. At first the Gondorian didn't trust the ranger and vice versa, only Elegost gained some trust in the Gondorian after Idrial voiced for him, in name of the lady of the light. After the group rescued the elven altars from corruption and finding the map, they went back down the mountains, in search of Elegost's friend.\n\nWhen they got back down, Elegost tracked his dwarven friend and the group was able to find him, deadlocked in a battle with a troll. Thanks to Berethor's sword the party could withstand the troll's fury. Following the fellowship, the party set out for Moria.\n\nThe Fellowship encounters the Watcher in the Water just before and after they enter Moria. Both times, Idrial and Hadhod use water and fire powers (respectively), and Elegost uses his deadly arrows to defeat the Watcher. The first time, the Watcher gets angry and destroys the rubble blocking the gateway into Moria, allowing the Fellowship to flee inside. The second time, they actually succeed in defeating it. Hadhod is devastated when entering Moria, and vows to get revenge on those who destroyed it. A little while in a true cave-like section of Moria, they discover a chest with one of seven ancient runes, which supposedly lead to a great treasure. In the mine galleries, they fight and slay a Goblin Shadow Chieftain. Hadhod and Elegost discover a map that leads to the great Mithril pit of Moria, and soon Berethor's party set off for the Necropolis, fighting many Goblins along the way. Unlike the Fellowship of the Ring, who was forced into Moria and desperate to find a way out as quickly as possible, Berethor's party is willing, almost eager to discover Moria's secrets (at the urging of Hadhod). They plan to take their time to discover Moria's secrets despite its terror...for now.\n\nBerethor's Company soon arrives at a huge necropolis, and begin searching the small chambers in the great halls. Many of these chambers contain ambushes by Goblins but Berethor and his party soon defeat them all. During the search they discover two more ancient runes. The Party then arrives at the Crossroads that the Fellowship had previously reached. After brief deliberation and rest, the party decides to choose the right path (which leads downward). This path leads to the great Mithril Pit of Moria. The Fellowship, seeing a way out in the far distance and collecting another rune in a chest, make their way to the far area. Before they can get there, however, a goblin body falls to the ground in front of them. Gandalf scolds Pippin (high up in the Chamber of Mazarbul), and Idrial picks up a key presumably leading to the Throne Room. The Balrog soon makes its appearance. It doesn't see Berethor's party, but it does smash the path leading to the exit. This alerts the Goblins and six warriors ambush the Company, surrounding them. The Company fortunately survive, and make their way back to the necropolis despite four more attacks. The company has now discovered the terrifying truth about Moria, but they are still willing to explore its various secrets...for now.\n\nAfter escaping back to the Necropolis, the Company proceed to the left path. This leads to an immense cavern consisting of high walls\/ceiling and a pit, which is spanned by a mighty bridge. While crossing, they are occasionally ambushed by Goblins. After the Company enter the Antechamber (again being ambushed by Goblins and discovering an ancient rune), they cross to the Throne Room. This particular room is held by an archer, a warrior, and a mighty Goblin sorcerer, called a Moria Goblin Shadow Commander. The Company defeats this attacking party and reads Moria's Book of Secrets, using the key they found on the Goblin body. An ancient door with symbols is discovered, and a key to some ancient sealed door revealed. The Company then checks an adjacent room, finding the last axe forged from Erebor stolen by goblins and another ancient rune. After brief ambushes, they make their way safely back across the huge pit cavern and back to the necropolis.\n\nThere is only one path left for Berethor's Company, the Left path. This leads to the final ancient rune and a majestic tomb. The Company slay all the Goblins in the area, and use the runes to open up the tomb. Inside, there is a suit of ancient armor made by the Dwarves from Erebor. Hadhod decides to wear it. There is a sealed door a little to the left, and Idrial incites the spell written on the Book of Secrets. The ancient door opens, and the Company proceeds to the halls of Dwarrowdelf.\n\nWhile viewing the majesty of these ancient halls, the Company slowly make their way across, fighting Goblins and opening various treasure chests. At the end of the road lies the entrance to Balin's Tomb. The Company enter inside only to find five Goblins. After a fierce battle, all the Goblins are successfully slain.\n\nBerethor's company enter the now-deserted Balin's Tomb, seeking an escaped goblin. The said goblin jumps right in front of them, ready to attack, but the Balrog suddenly breaks in the eastern wall of the tomb. The company instantly hides in various parts of the tomb, while the goblin is incinerated. The Balrog then leaves seeking Gandalf, and Idrial warns that the Company must find him first.\n\nBerethor and his company being making their way to the door at the opposite end of the Dwarrowdelf hall. They begin discussing the sheer might of the Balrog, while escaping various Goblins, including another surrounding fight. Along the way, they discover various treasures including Balin's Walking Axe. When they reach the end of the hall, they make their way through to find a huge chasm spanned with small bridges.\n\nThe Company proceeds over the chasm, defeating any Goblins they encounter. At a huge chamber they see a Goblin statue. Hadhod vows to destroy the Moria Goblins once and for all, and Idrial promises to help clear out the Goblins. A Goblin archer sees them, but they kill them before they warn the others. After a bit Idrial almost falls into the chasm, but Berethor saves her. They proceed up the stairs into a different part of the Dwarrowdelf.\n\nSoon afterwards, the Fellowship proceeds to find a different way out of Moria, destroying many Goblin rituals and gatherings along the way. Their first challenge comes when they arrive at an ancient Balrog altar, where a Shadow Commander is leading a ritual for the Balrog. The Fellowship slowly defeats the shaman and moves on. Their next challenge is a Goblin drummer, who summons more Goblins from the depths. After slaying him, they proceed to the ancient Mausoleum of the Goblins. Berethor and his company eventually makes it to an ancient Goblin chamber, where they slay many Goblins and find ancient Goblin treasure.\n\nWith increasing desperation and hope, the Company proceeds towards the same chasm, though now with access to the Bridge of Khazad-dum. During their escape, they discover an ancient golden Lorien helm. They see Gandalf battling the Balrog and rush to help. When they arrive, they prepare to battle. Knowing that their own chances of survive are very small, Berethor and his company mainly use their skills to weaken the Balrog and support Gandalf, while Gandalf does the actual work attacking the Balrog with his \"Bolt of the Valar\". After a long time, the Balrog is finally defeated and both he and Gandalf fall into the chasm. The Company hurries to escape Moria, finally fleeing its dark halls and Goblins.\n\nChapter 3 -\n\nChapter 4 -\n\nChapter 5 -\n\nBerethor is the \"leader\" of the company, which is the reason he is the only person to have Leadership Skills. His primary skill, though, is Sword Craft, which allows him to use powerful attacks that stack with his already high strength rating.\n\nLater in the game, Berethor acquires a handful of swords with the Biting Blade ability as well as several with the Weeping Blade ability. These abilities replace his normal Attack. Weeping Blade does damage over time, while Biting Blade gives some of the damage Berethor inflicts on his opponent back to him in Health Points (similar to Eaoden's Drain Health). Weeping Blade and Biting Blade also replace Berethor's Counter Attack. This is very useful; when Berethor is attacked, his counterattack allows him to gain some of his lost health back.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Berethor"}}

Unknown to Túrin at that time, Morgoth had placed a curse on all of Húrin's family.\n\nWhen Túrin was eight years old Morwen sent him to Doriath, where he was adopted by Thingol as a son. After this Túrin's second sister, Nienor was born. Túrin was restless, and as soon as he was permitted he joined Beleg Cúthalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the orcs of Morgoth. He wore the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, and the orcs feared him above all others.\n\nTúrin accidentally caused the death of Saeros, one of Thingol's counselors who had provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven, he fled, eventually encountering a band of outlaws that dwelt south of Brethil. There he identified himself only as Neithan (the wronged). Túrin killed their leader, and became their leader in his place. During his rule, he stopped the outlaws from raiding houses of free folk, and only hunted Orcs.\n\nIn the meantime, Beleg Cúthalion obtained leave by Thingol to seek out his friend. In FA 487, Beleg found Túrin's outlaws at the outskirts of Amon Rûdh and was held tied up in question by them until Túrin returned; when Beleg could not persuade his friend to leave the outlaws, he left to return to Doriath. Túrin's band later captured Mîm the Petty-dwarf while Beleg and Túrin were parted. Mîm was forced to share his halls on Amon Rûdh with his company while Túrin promised to repay Mîm for the accidental death of his son Khîm.\n\nAt Doriath, Beleg asked to be able to join his friend. Thingol allowed this and also gave him the sword Anglachel, and Thingol's wife Melian gave him Lembas. Beleg returned to Túrin that winter, healing those of the band that had become sick with cold. Beleg brought with him the Dragon-helm, after Turin agreed to take the Dragon-helm, the area around Amon Rûdh became known as Dor-Cúarthol, \"The Land of Bow and Helm\" (since Beleg was known as a mighty bowman). There Túrin took the name Gorthol, \"The Dread Helm\". Many warriors joined them, and much of the West of Beleriand was freed from evil for a while.\n\nEventually, Túrin was betrayed by Mîm the dwarf. He was captured at the top of Amon Rûdh and all his men were slain about him. Beleg survived and rescued Túrin from the orcs in Taur-nu-Fuin with the help of Gwindor, an escaped slave of Morgoth, but Túrin accidentally killed Beleg with Beleg's sword Anglachel. Beleg , who was trying to cut Túrins bonds, was mistaken by Túrin as one of the orcs tormenting him. Thus, he roared in fear and killed Beleg and awoke the camp, Gwindor and Túrin then fled. Gwindor led Túrin whose mind was lost in a silent sadness, to the Pools of Ivrin, where he then cried and his madness was cured.\n\nGwindor then led Túrin to Nargothrond, where once he had lived. In Nargothrond, Túrin hid his name, calling himself by the alias Agarwaen son of Úmarth (Sindarin for \"Bloodstained son of Ill-fate\"), while hopeing to hide his identity and escape Morgoth's curse upon his kin. He had Anglachel reforged and named it Gurthang, \"Iron of Death\". Finduilas, daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. Túrin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him Thurin (the secret). He was also called Adanedhel (Man-Elf) because he was so like an elf, though he was human. Gwindor later revealed Túrin's true identity to Finduilas when anger and sadness over took him and it eventually reached Finduilas' father, King Orodreth.\n\nThe revelation of his identity resulted in Túrin becoming a chief counsellor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the Nargothrondrim to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with Gurthang, he himself became known as the Mormegil (Black Sword), or the Black Sword of Nargothrond. In FA 495, with Orodreth now deep in the council of Túrin, the Elves of Nargothrond marched out from their secret city with an army of some thousands of elves to confront the enemy massing beneath the Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow) and in the Pass of Sirion. They were overwhelmed and driven into the Plain of Tumhalad and utterly defeated in the Battle of Tumhalad. Only Túrin, who wore the Dragon Helm of Dor-lómin was able to survive the hot fiery blasts of Glaurung and escaped. There was a desperate attempt to destroy the bridge Túrin has ordered to be built for swifter actions of the army, alas it was too well made and the enemy arrived and Glaurung the father of dragons destroyed the gate and the sacking of the once mighty Nargothrond, began.\n\nTúrin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung at the smashed gate of the city, and stood by idly as Finduilas and hundreds of captives was dragged away, Finduilas called to him, once her cries were drowed out in the distance Túrin was released from Glaurung's spell of which deceived Túrin into believing Morwen and Nienor were suffering in Dor-lómin, and Túrin abandoned Finduilas to seek out his kin. In actuality, Morwen and Nienor were safely in Doriath, as Túrin's own efforts had made the way passable.\n\nOnce in Dor-lómin, Túrin found his old home empty. He went to the halls of the Easterling lord Brodda, who had taken Húrin's kinswoman Aerin as a wife and many a time beaten her and enslaved Túrin's people, Brodda had also taken Húrin's lands and possessions to which also rightfully belonged to Túrin. From Aerin, Túrin learned that Morwen had left, and in his rage, he held Brodda up like a dog and threw him in a group of men breaking his neck killing Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate. As Túrin left again, Aerin burnt herself alive in Brodda's halls, and the remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even with more cruelly.\n\nTúrin next tried to find Finduilas, but by the time he picked up the Orc's trail he came too late: the woodsmen of Brethil informed him she had been killed as they had tried to rescue the prisoners of Nargothrond. Túrin collapsed on the mound she was buried in, and was brought to Brethil.\n\nIn Brethil Túrin again took up his life, now calling himself Turambar (Master of Doom) in an act of bravado, deciding that his curse was now finally over. One night in the middle of a fierce storm he and his men found a naked young woman on Finduilas's grave, and called her Níniel \" Maiden of tears\" for see cried for she knew nothing. Túrin years later took her as his wife. Túrin did not know that this was indeed his sister, whose memory had been erased by Glaurung. Brandir, out of jealousy or forecast, told Niniel that a shadow was cast above Túrin, and that instead of being Master of Shadow, the Shadow would inevitably master him.\n\nTúrin's happiness ended when Glaurung came near Brethil, burning miles and miles of forest so that he could reach where the woodsmen lived. Túrin with two others set out to kill the dragon, but he was the only one to reach the drake. Dorlas, being too cowardly, abandoned Túrin, but Hunthor the faithful went on. As Túrin passed underneath the dragon, he nearly toppled into the waters due to the dragon's stench had it not been for Hunthor, who steadied him. Unfortunately as a result of this action a stone moved by Glaurang's passing hit Hunthor on the head, and he fell into the ravine. With his black sword and bitterness in his heart, Túrin then stabbed the dragon's belly with all his hatred and power; killing Glaurung at Cabed-en-Aras, but was hurt and fell in a swoon. As Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words revealed to her she was his sister. Horrified, Nienor Níniel killed herself by leaping into the ravines of the river.\n\nWhen Túrin awoke he was told by Brandir the Lame, lord of the Haladin of Brethil what had happened, he killed Brandir in anger in front of many people, refusing to believe the truth. When he learned from Mablung of Doriath who had come to seek him that Brandir was telling truth and that he had wrongfully slew him, he could no longer live with the pains and misfortunes of his life and decided to take his life. Just before his death, he revealed that he had been 'blind'; Morgoth's curse had him groping in the dark since childhood.\n\nThen, Turin said to Gurthang: \"Hail Gurthang, iron of death, thou alone now remainest! But what lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand that wieldeth thee? From no blood wilt thou shrink! Wilt thou take Tùrin Turambar? Wilt thou slay me swiftly?\"\n\nAnd from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: \"Yea, I will drink thy blood, that may I forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly.\" Then Tùrin set the hilts upon the ground, and cast himself upon the point of Gurthang, and the black blade took his life. Túrin and several of the others connected to his story are some of the few people in the Middle-earth legendarium to have committed suicide.\n\nAn alternate interpretation of Túrin's revelation mirrors that of his father's in the Silmarillion, that all that he had seen was twisted by the malice and might of Morgoth, and so as if blind, he stumbled through life.\n\nTúrin was buried near Finduilas' grave, in a high mound where he had fallen, and the shards of Gurthang were set beside him.\n\n'And thereon the Elves carved in the Runes of Doriath: TÚRIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA\n (Túrin, Master of Fate, Slayer of Glaurung).\n\nand beneath they wrote also:\n\nNIËNOR NÍNIEL\n\nAfter Húrin, Túrin's father, was released from Angband, he and his wife Morwen met at the gravesite of their children for the first and last time, and Morwen died when the sun set holding Húrin's hand and was also buried there. The mound they were buried beneath survived the War of Wrath and Tol Morwen was the westernmost isle off the coast of Lindon in the Second and Third Ages.\n\nWhether the tragedies in Túrin's life were the result of Morgoth's curse or of his own arrogance, or some combination of the two, are a subject of some debate among fans and scholars.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/T%C3%BArin"}}

He had a younger brother Anárion, born in SA 3219. They lived at the haven of Rómenna on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their father was Elendil and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of Andúnië. The Lords of Andúnië were descended from the Kings of Númenor through Silmarien, the daughter of the fourth King of Númenor, Tar-Elendil.\n\nElros, the Half-elven and the first King of Númenor, had chosen the mortal life of Men, while his brother Elrond chose the immortal life of Elves. Over time, the Kings of Númenor grew to resent their ancestor's choice and desired immortality for themselves. They became estranged from the Elves and from the powers called the Valar and they neglected the worship of Eru, the one who had created them.\n\nA small group of Númenóreans remained friendly with the elves and faithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among these men were the Lords of Andúnië.\n\nIn SA 3262, Ar-Pharazon, the King of Númenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to Númenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he wanted to corrupt the Númenóreans in order to bring about their downfall. He used their desire for immortality and power to convince them to renounce Eru and worship Morgoth.\n\nIsildur learned that Sauron wanted Ar-Pharazon to cut down Nimloth, the White Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised himself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from Nimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving grave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed, Isildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but when the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was recovered from his injuries.\n\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave Númenor. They filled their ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the Palantíri. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.\n\nIsildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the Faithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became of him is not known and he was never seen again.\n\nAs Ar-Pharazon felt the approach of old age, Sauron's lies finally convinced him he could achieve immortality in the Undying Lands. In SA 3319, Ar-Pharazon set out with a great fleet intending to take the Undying Lands by force, but when he set foot on the shore, Ilúvatar caused the Seas to open up and Valinor was hidden. The fleet sank and Númenor was destroyed by a great wave.\n\nThe ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north, while Isildur and Anarion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south. Elendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the South-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he dwelt in Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.\n\nIsildur and Anárion had their thrones side by side in the Great Hall of Osgiliath, the city they founded on the Anduin. Anarion lived in Minas Anor on the western side of the Anduin, while Isildur made his home in Ithilien on the eastern side of the Anduin. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor. Minas Ithil was a beautiful white city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had already returned there in secret and had begun to rebuild his strength.\n\nIsildur had one of the Palantír called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. He planted the seedling of the White Tree in front of his house. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to the Blackroot Vale in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from Númenor. Isildur met with the King of the Dead, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.\n\nSauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in 3429. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and another seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth to Arnor, where Elendil dwelled. Elendil consulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430. That same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Elrond in Rivendell.\n\nThe army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431 and then marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons - Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon - went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their infant son Valandil remained in Rivendell.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to Barad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed, including Isildur's brother Anárion who died in SA 3440.\n\nAt last in SA 3441, Sauron himself came down from his tower. He fought with Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron's body was cast down, but Gil-galad and Elendil died in the struggle. Elendil's sword broke beneath him as he fell.\n\nIsildur took up the hilt of his sword and used the broken blade to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but as long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his spirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for himself. Elrond and Círdan were the only two individuals who marked Isildur's actions, as they alone had been with Gil-galad during the contest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil. A very short time later, short enough for the heat-induced markings on the Ring to still be visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and it's apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed it would hurt forever. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled, seemed to shrink, and that the writing upon it's outer band seemed to be fading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that he refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm to it.\n\nIsildur assumed the Kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but he intended to return to the North and leave Anarion's son Meneldil to rule in the South. He remained in Minas Anor for a few years to give counsel and instruction to Meneldil. Together they took a journey through all the lands belonging to Gondor. On the summit of Halifirien in the Firien wood, Isildur entombed the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving Minas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree in memory of his brother Anarion.\n\nOn September 5, TA 2, Isildur set out from Minas Anor with his three elder sons and 200 knights. They marched up the Vales of the Anduin on the eastern side of the River, heading for the High Pass over the Misty Mountains.\n\nThirty days later, on October 4, Isildur's company was attacked by Orcs near the Gladden Fields. The Orcs did not know that Isildur had the One Ring, but they were unwittingly drawn by its power. Isildur's men were outnumbered ten to one, and though they initially managed to repel the attack, the Orcs renewed their assault after nightfall and the men were overwhelmed.\n\nBefore the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire Ohtar with the Shards of Elendil's sword. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it was useless in defending his men against the Orcs. He realized now that he did not have the strength to wield the Ring and could not even put it on without great pain to himself. Isildur regretted the foolish pride that had led him to keep the Ring.\n\nIsildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was killed. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee in order to prevent the Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great sorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining Dúnedain.\n\nIsildur put on the Ring though it pained him and headed for the Anduin. He removed his armor and waded into the River intending to try to cross it. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him toward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring left Isildur's finger and was lost in the waters. Isildur initially felt an overwhelming sense of loss, but was then relieved as if a great burden had been lifted from him. He rose out of the water, but at that moment, he was spotted by orcs who shot him with arrows through the throat and heart.\n\nThe One Ring remained in the Gladden Fields until Déagol found it in TA 2463. Isildur's body also lay in the waters, undiscovered by his kin. While searching for the One Ring, Saruman found the Elendilmir that Isildur had been wearing, and some speculated that the Wizard may have found and even burned Isildur's remains in one of his furnaces, but whether this is true is not known (likely it is not, as Isildur's remains had been sitting in marshwater for nearly 3000 years at that point; there would almost certainly have been nothing left to dispose of).\n\nIsildur's youngest son Valandil became the King of Arnor when he came of age in the year 10, but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and the two Kingdoms became separated.

She aided Manwë in the rule of Arda and the watching of Middle-earth. She made the stars, filled the Lamps of the Valar with light, collected the dew of the Two Trees in her Wells, fashioned the newer stars and constellations in preparation for the Awakening of the Elves, hallowed the Silmarils, established the courses of the Moon and Sun, and set the Star of Elendil in the sky.\n\nBecause of her creation of the stars, the Elves of Middle-earth revere and love her the most out of the Valar. They even gave her the name of \"Elbereth\", invoke her in times where they require aid, and sing her praises whenever the stars rise. It was also said that when Manwë sits beside her upon their throne on Taniquetil, she was able to hear more clearly than any other ears, the prayers and laments of those in need from the furthest east even unto the west.\n\nAt times, she would answer the prayers of not only Elves, but also those of other races.

He designed the race to be the most resistant to corruption and influence of Morgoth and later Sauron who had been Aulë's servant. They were designed in their father's own image as creators and workers of the earth and stone. but were also like and unlike Elves and Men. Because Morgoth was yet on the earth he made them strong and unyielding to Morgoth and his servants so that they might resist his corruption and influence. But they were also stubborn and fast in friendship and emnity; But there would always be strife between the children of Aulë, and those of Illuvatar. In particular there was hostility between the Elves and the Dwarves. Though dwarves are not naturally evil and not necessarily hostile.Because of their unyielding resistance, the seven rings of Power of the dwarves did not turn them to evil, but it did amplify their greed and lust for gold which was evil enough. It is said that very few willfully served the side of darkness. Of those who did very little was written.\n\nIt is suggested that of the dwarves that turned to wickedness (in first and later ages), they most likely came from the eastern kindreds of the Dwarves of the far eastern mansions (and perhaps some of the nearer ones). They may have awakened under the Shadow of Morgoth and turned to evil, in a similar way as the eastern Men did later. But not by the power of the Rings. It is however unclear if these refer to Dwarves beyond Iron Hills (the most eastern known stronghold of the Dwarves in the Third Age)The dwarves were a warlike race and they would fight fiercely against whomsoever aggrieved them: servants of Melkor, or Eldar, or Avari, or wild beasts, or not seldom their own kin, Dwarves of other mansions and lordships.\n\nAt the time of the awakening the dwarves had awoken in four principal locations (in the west this included Ered Lindon, and Mount Gundabad). The other two places were the dwarves awakened were further east (at distances as great or greater than distance between the first two locations). These eastern dwarves included; the Ironfists and Stiff-beards, and that of the Blacklocks and Stonefoots, respectively.\n\nHowever though the four places of awakening were sundered; the various kindreds still kept communication, and in early ages often held assemblies of delegates at Mount Gundabad. It is known that even the most distant would send help to any of their people in times of need (as was the case in the great War against the Orcs during the Third Age). Which suggests that not all the far eastern Dwarves had fallen under the Shadow.\n\nDuring this time there came the Petty-Dwarves to Beleriand long before the return of Morgoth. They had been exiled from the places of awakening to the east. The great Dwarves despised the Petty-Dwarves, who it was said were descendents of dwarves who had been driven out from the Communities, being deformed or undersized, or slothful and rebellious. They were masterless and few in number, and took to the ways of stealth. They were a selfish and self-serving lot who were willing to betray others if it meant saving their own lives (unlike most Dwarves in general). They were known to keep to stealth, darkness, and night. It is said they differed from normal dwarves in various ways: they were smaller, far more unsociable, and they freely gave away their names: other dwarves kept their Khuzdul names and language a secret.\n\nNot long after the Eldar  had come to Beleriand, they only became aware of the existence of the Petty-Dwarves when they were attacked at night, or when the elves caught them alone in the wild places. They were thought to be only some kind of cunning-two legged animals living in caves, and began to hunt them. But this ended after elves became acquainted with the great Dwarves.  But achieving that,  and they left the remaining Petty-dwarves alone.. It is said there were no emnity when the elves first encountered the dwarves, but there was no great love between them either. The dwarves were fast in friendship and and in enmity. They aided the elves greatly in their war with the Orcs of Morgoth; though the Noldor believed that some of that folk would not have been loath to smithy also for Morgoth, had he been in need of their work or open to their trade. For buying and selling and exchange were their delight, and the winning of wealth thereby; and this they gathered rather to hoard than to use, save in further trading. \n\nThe great Dwarves still acknowledged their kinship and had resented the injuries done to their lesser kin the Petty-dwarves. It was one of great Dwarves grievances against the Eldar that they had hunted and slain their kin, who had settled in Beleriend before the elves came there. But this was set aside in consideration of the plea that the Petty-dwarves had never declared themselves to the Eldar, nor presented any claims to land or habitations, but had at once attacked the newcomers in darkness and and ambush. However, because the Great Dwarves despised their lesser kin, some say they had no compunction in helping the elves in ousting their brethren from Nargothrond especially for great reward. But for the Petty-dwarves, the grievance smouldered because of it. They hated the Eldar and Orcs with equal passion, and the Exiles most of all; for the Noldar later took their lands; including Norgothond and caused the end of their race.\n\nBy this time there were few of them surviving, and they were very wary and too fearful to attack any Elf, unless their hiding places were approached to closely. In time the race dwindled until there was only Mim and his two sons left  After his son, Khim had been killed by Turin and his outlaws, Mim convinced them to spare his own life, and lead them to his home. There he cursed Androg, the one who had fired the arrow killing his son to die if he ever fired another arrow, and he also wished the deaths or hard life of any who took his things and put him into bondage. He took a liking (or at least respect) to Turin; and this increased after Mim learned that the Man had previously had trouble with the elves whom the dwarf detested. But Turin ever admonished Mim whenever he mentioned his hatred of the Eldar. And Mim spied on the men from shadowy corners or a doorways of his home when they thought him elsewhere. He made them uneasy, they began speaking only in whispers.\n\nWhen Beleg came into his home and stayed, Mim's hatred for the elves grew ever greater  (he and his last son began sit in the deepest shadows of his house, speaking to none). During this time Andred's curse took form, but Beleg healed his wound. Mim's hatred burned ever fiercer for his curse had been undone (but he vowed that the curse would bite again). Secondly he was denied Lembas (which he believed would restore his youth), and since he could not steal it, he feigned sickness and begged it of his enemy. But the elf refused him and the seal was set upon his hatred of the elf, and all the more because the elf was loved by Turin. He ever looked on with  jealousy for the love Turin bore to Beleg.\n\nMim was aware of the presence of Orcs in the lands about Amon Rûdh, and the hatred that he bore to Beleg led in resolve in his darkened to an evil resolve to betray the company. One day he claimed he and his son Ibun were going out to find roots for the winter store, he really sought to seek out the servants of Morgoth to lead to Turn's hiding place (another tale suggests that Mim did not encounter the orcs with deliberate intent, but rather that the capture of his son and their threat to torture that led Mim to treachery). After he and his son had found or had been captured by orcs, he laid out his conditions to the Orcs. Thus Mim gave the Orcs his demands that they pay him in weight in iron each man they caught or slew, but for Turin and Beleg he wanted gold. That once his house was ride of the outlaws, it be left to him, and he would be unmolested. He wanted Beleg left behind and bound for Mim to have his way with, and Turin to be left to go free.\n\nFor the second time he promised to lead the Orcs back to his home in order to save his own life. Some versions of the tale omit the part that the Orcs threatened to keep Ibun hostage to make sure Mim kept his part of the bargain though they themselves had little intent to keep it; Thus Mim thought at first tried to back out of it, but they had his son and so he was obliged to lead them to his home. After Mim guided them to his home in the middle of the night. many of Turin's men were killed unawares, slain as they slept. Some tales suggest that Turin and Beleg and their watchers saw Mim and the orcs before they even reached the threshold of the dwarven home They and others escaped to the hidden stair leading to the top of the hill, some were shot down trying to escape the steps leading up to the top the hill. Those above fought the orcs and died; only Turin escaped or rather as some tales say he was captured and bound and carried off. It was here on the top of the hill that Androg fell, finally slain by Mim's treacherous curse. Beleg had also fallen, or as in other tales he had been captured and bound and laid on the ground with wrists and ankles tied to iron pins driven to the rock. After which the orcs defiled the dwarf's home. Mim hid in the caves, and after they departed he went up the stairs. Some tales suggest that in hatred Mim attempted to steal Beleg's sword from the fallen elf, preparing to kill Beleg who had fallen but who not died, but the elf resisted, the elf declared that the house of Hador would take vengeance on the dwarf. Other versions the dwarf went before Beleg unmoving and prostrate and gloated over him with a sharp knife. Androg who  lay dying from Mim's curse seized a sword (perhaps Beleg's) and was the one who thrust at Mim, and with his last strength freed the elf from his bonds (but his injuries could not be healed by the elf, and Mim had his way).From whomever the slash came from, Mim fled in terror before he himself could be killed.\n\nFollowing departure of Glaurung and death of Túrin Turambar, Mim found his way to Nargothrond, and took possession of the ruined halls; in greed he fingered the gold and gems; letting them run through his hands. He was left alone for people feared the spirit of Glaurung and his very memory. That was until the coming of Húrin, Turin's father who in vengeance came to slay the dwarf. Though Mim in fear besought mercy, he was slain on the spot before the doors of Nargothrond. The house of Hador had been avenged for Mîm's treachery and deceit. Thus ended one of the earliest accounts of wicked dwarves who had made alliances with orcs and goblins, though the union had been unfriendly and treacherous.\n\nHowever, there, some say, the curse that Mîm laid upon the gold at his death \u2018came upon the possessors in this wise.The treasure of Nargothrond (some say it was half the treasure or only the Nauglamir) was brought Doriath (Atanor), where eventually the gold was a reason for the Sack of Doriath and the death of Thingol, and soon after the Dwarves of Nogrod. The dark curse filled the Elven house with for a lust for gold and unwillingness to lose any of their treasures. The greed affected even Thingol. The dwarves from Nogrod (Broadbeams) who had smithed for the elven king came to the king for payment, but the curse had also affected them and they also lusted for the gold, the Necklace of the Dwarves, and the Silmaril. Thingol in his paranoia was emboldened to insult the dwarves, but the dwarves under influence of the curse chose to murder him and sack Doriath. They were later destroyed by the Green-elves in retaliation on their return back from Doriath, and Naugladur, Lord of Nogrod was killed, and the Necklace was lost. Of these actions the Dwarves of Belegost, the Longbeards chose to protest and resist their plans; though their counsel was not taken by the Broadbeams. Still some accounts suggest Mim never had a chance to curse the gold, and that the dwarves committed murder in cold blood of their own free. Whichever the case, these actions had future repercussions in later ages in that Dwarves and Elves maintained a distrust for each other and in some cases hatred for each other and had other wars between them. Though this distrust is known to have mainly have affected the Longbeards in latter times. Both sides blamed the other for starting it. A series of wicked actions shared among a few dwarves and a few elves had ruined relations for future generations.\n\nIt is said that Dagorlad, the Battle Plane all living things were divided, and some of every race and creature where found in the hosts of both the Last Alliance and that of Saurons, except for the Elves. Of the seven houses few fought on the side of evil during the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age, and is known that none from the Longbeards, the House of Durin ever fought on the side of evil.\n\nThough the reasons leading the wicked dwarves to fight under Sauron's forces is vague, in the earlier age it was believed that some of Dwarven folk would not have been loath to smithy for Morgoth, had he been in need of their work or open to their trade so as to increase their wealth;  so they hoarded treasure rather than using it, except what little was needed to increase trade. Sauron however was more open to working with Dwarves than Morgoth had been, and it was during this time that the lesser rings, and the Rings of Power were forged and other great works. While he could not dominate the dwarves with the rings, for the only power over them that the Rings wielded was to inflame their hearts with a greed of gold and precious things, that if they lacked treasure; all other good things seemed profitless, and they were filled with wrath and desire for vengeance on all who deprived them. The rings fed off of gold. gold was needed to make more treasure. For as long as the dwarves were successful its power remained active; and the rings were the foundation of the Seven Hoards of the Dwarf-kings (later plundered by dragons).\n\nStill loathing the fact that he could not directly control the race; Sauron tried to recover the rings. Two were recovered though it is not known how he recovered them and four ended up in dragon hoards. Perhaps the two were taken from the eastern clans who joined him and of any of other clans that he rallied behind those dwarven kings . Offered promises of greater riches, lands and power, the rings were taken with honeyed words if only they would return the rings (similar to the offer made to Dain in the Third Age) amplified by the gold lust and greed from the rings (they accpted). However they had to have sided with the forces under their own free will (as the rings could not force them to make the choice) nor could they be dominated by Sauron. Perhaps this was boldened by their previous enmity between the Elves and Dwarves caused by the curse of Mim's gold in the First Age and had lead to the death leaders among both races; and wars between their races. ...and if promises hadn't worked perhaps he took the rings with violence. The other three had to have been destroyed either by dragons sent by Sauron against his enemies (or that attacked the dwarven kings in the later age). However Sauron took or destroyed the rings and had betrayed the dwarves.\n\nDuring this age, Durin III came into power around the year 1600.  Durin's folk likely only avoided siding with Sauron for several reasons;\n\nFirst the Longbeards befriended the elves of Eregion; it had been the first and only time in history in which the normally hostile dwarves and elves made friendship with each other. For all previous encounters with dwarves had either been cool or hostile with no love between the groups; but trade and diplomancy out of need and to fight a common enemy. In this era smithcraft reached its highest development. Secondly, although the increase in smith technology lead to the rise of Sauron and the creation of the Rings of Power causing trouble for all the Free Peoples of the age; the Longbeards of Moria had firsthand experience with the treachery of Sauron and thus were more likely to turn aganst him. The third reason; By suggestion of the Dwarves, Durin had been gifted with the first of the seven and most powerful of the Dwarven Rings of Power by the Elvensmiths including Celebrimbor and not by Sauron's hand (though it evil power was still on the ring). Finally, during most of the Second Age when the war began; the house of Durin locked itself behind the gates of Moria and avoided being conquered by Sauron though Eregion had been destroyed in the war. Thus they avoided the majority of the war (though their people still dwindled in number). But they were better prepared than most to join the Last Alliance and would do to help their friends (while other clans were more open to the highest bidder).\n\nWhile the Seven Houses could only use their the rings in the getting of wealth; the wrath and overmastering greed of gold kindled in their hearts caused evil enough for Sauron; as in the past they fought amongst the races of the world even between the dwarven houses. But this time divided along the two sides of the conflict.\n\nDuring the early parts of the Third Age (or at least in legends of the previous), it is known that in some places wicked dwarves had made alliances with the goblins and orcs. Hobbits of the Third Age are said to have encountered hostile dwarves of which they feared and had little trust. These alliances were made before the rise of the Necromancer  in Dol Guldur. Because Dwarves are not evil by nature, few ever served the Enemy of their own free will (though rumors of Men suggest it was greater).\n\nBy the latter part of the Third Age it is not clear if any dwarves of the eastern houses or otherwise served the Enemy during the War of the Ring, the hobbits of the shire encountered an unusual number of strange dwarves from the east who were trying to flee West from Mordor's influence (as was also noted in Bree). These may have fled from as east as the Iron Hills to further east (and including from the last two places of awakening). It may suggest that the bulk of the good dwarves left the bad lands, leaving any evil ones behind.\n\nWhile not all dwarves are evil, the attitudes of Dwarves can lead others to think they are bad, thieves or worse, and sometimes their greed can lead them to do bad or dark things. Thorin Oakenshield, for example, was overwhelmed by greed after recovering his family's riches (and the riches once belonging to Dale and the Wood-elves), and enraged by the presence of Thranduil, he betrayed his allies, refused to share any part of the treasure (including the treasure that never even belonged to the dwarves). Instead, he sent a raven to seek aid from his relative, Dáin II Ironfoot, who had a legion of Dwarven soldiers on the move to secure the reclaimed mountain city. Meanwhile, Thorin charged his companions with looking for the Arkenstone within the hoard of treasure. However Bilbo had already found the Arkenstone, and subsequently, secretly brought it to Bard and Thranduil to use as a bargaining counter. When Thorin learned of Bilbo's actions he became enraged and denounced his former companion as a traitor. The growing conflict over the treasure between Dwarves, Wood Elves, and Men, likely to result in bloodshed, was suddenly averted by the approach of Goblin and Warg armies, so they instead joined forces to defeat their common enemies in what was later called the Battle of the Five Armies. In the end while Thorin and some his other companions were killed during the war. They had regained their honor and reputation in defending their allies against a common threat\n\nDain was offered a deal by Mordor, that if he helped them find the ring, Sauron would return the three Dwarven rings he had, as well as Moria as their home forever, as well as great reward and friendship of Sauron. Dain refused out of loyalty to the west, but also because they had ever been betrayed by Sauron of old.\n\nThroughout the various Ages, since the Awakening of the Dwarves, there has been some enmity between the Free Peoples of Middle-earth over various and often petty reasons. The enmity was not always caused by Morgoth (or later Sauron and Saruman) but it benefited them. The Dwarves were not immune to this enmity either causing suspicion among others, or distrusting others themselves (which may have led to rumors and stories of them being evil among some Men, and other races), or quick to take vengeance against the smallest slights. Even the First Age relations while not filled with emnity was at least cool (there was no love between the) but hostile as well. It is said it wasn't until the Second Age was their a friendship between the elves  of Eregion and dwarves of Moria. It was for the first and only time in the history of the world.\n\nSome of the dwarves accused of fighting on the side of darkness may have been in conflict due to enmity between the races due to misunderstandings and suspicion. This may apply to the Petty-Dwarves who became distrustful and had great hatred of the Elves because most of their kind was wiped out, and also between them and other dwarves since they had been exiled by the other clans. Nor did they tend to get along with the humans either. In particular the Petty-Dwarves are said to love none but themselves, they hated the Orcs and Eldar with equal passion, and the Exiles most of all, for the Noldor had stolen their lands and their homes; the Petty-Dwarves had first discovered Nargothrond, and delved its riches.  When the Edain first encountered the Dwarves in Beleriand (Longbeards in particular), they distrusted the Dwarves fearing they were under the Shadow of Morgoth, but discovered they were not and agreed and were happy of their later alliance during the Second Age, leading to esteem and friendship. It was said there was little love between the Dwarves and some of the Noldor, as the dwarves were quick to resentment, and Caranthir was haughty and had scorn for the physical appearance of the dwarves. Still they maintained an alliance for a while over their mutual fear and hate of Morgoth.To the hobbits, dwarves both friendly or hostile were aliens to them,  and most relations were uneasy and clouded by fear. It is said that less than decent dwarves do not get along with the elves, the more decent ones consider the elves foolish or become annoyed (for they tease and laugh at them, and most of all at their beards).\n\nIn some cases there was enmity between the races caused by the greed and envy; men lusting after the dwarves' wealth and their handiwork, and possibly between the Dwarven clans themselves. In one story,  Fram is said to have sent the teeth of Scatha to the dwarves, after the requested their treasures be returned. It is said that they saw this as a great insult and killed Fram causing loss of love between dwarves and Rohan. Many of the dwarves had become nomadic merchants and smiths without a home wandering and trespassing through foreign and private lands (which may have been viewed with suspicion in some places). There was definitely enmity between the Great Dwarves and the Petty-Dwarves over various reasons.\n\nStill others became estranged from each other for other reasons; the rise of the enmity and distrust between dwarves and elves after the dealings between dwarves and King Thingol ended with the Fall of Doriath, and after the fall of Khazad-dum. Leading to battles between the races. What may at times have been fought in self-defense may be seen as an evil action by the opposing force (for example distrust of the wood-elves of Mirkwood and Thorin's party). But in these cases those involved were never allied with the Enemy or his ambassadors (though the wars between the Free Peoples may have worked to his advantage). The trust and interaction between elves and dwarves was later restored through the friendship of Legolas and Gimli. Other minor and petty reasons some dwarves did not get along with elves in the Third Age was the fact that the elves teased them, especially for their beards (the most decent of dwarves called the elves foolish or got annoyed).\n\nWhile generally the stuff of legends (in Tolkien's earliest works see The Lays of Beleriend), there are a few references to dwarves having forged fell weapons or at least rumored to have been forged (that sometimes 'betray' their owners or lead to some darker end). In the story of Eol and Maeglin father and son who spent much time around the dwarves. Eol the Dark Elf who hated other elves learned their craft and forged dark weapons and armor some that were poisoned. Some say that their had been a sinister effect with the Elvish association with the dwarves. Perhaps there was as killed his wife with a poisoned javelin, which lead to his own death being tossed over the wall, and later the fall of Gondolin with the help of his own son siding with Sauron. One of his blades Anglachel given to Thingol and later to Beleg was said to have malice in it for the heart of the smith was still in it, and Eol's heart was dark. It did not love the hand that wielded it, and would not abide it long.. It later tasted the blood of Turin's foot. The sword said to sing with gladness for it enjoyed tasting the blood of those in battle, and its own masters. In the end Beleg was killed by his own weapon when Turin used it against the elf thinking him to be an enemy. Losing his friend caused him grief for long periods. Later after the sword was reforged as Gurthang (Mormegil) the black iron sword of death (of black metal tinged with flame) . While using the sword he killed Brandir ignoring the honest information giving to him. Later Turin committed suicide after killing the dragon (though this also had to do with the curse the dragon had put on him and the suicide of his sister and his unborn child). The blade had its own sentience and it it could speak; like Anglachel before it sought to taste Turin's blood. But Turin's grief caused the blade to shatter (yet though it was a cursed weapon it did not like the taste of blood of those killed unjustly as was the case with Brandir). And Manthor had a knife said to be a fell blade from a forge of the Dwarves. Even the legendary Dwarven knife Angrist (the mate of Narsil) forged by the smith Telchar of Nogrod snapped when Beren needed it the most awakening Morgoth, and likewise Narsil shattered when Elendil was fighting Sauron, and shattered when he fell (though its shard did its job removing the One Ring). But Narsil was later reforged and served Aragon well.\n\nDue to the nature of putting together a 'complete and continuous story' of Beren and Lúthien concept of cursed weapons and some accounts of 'treacherous Dwarves' are reintroduced in the 2017 novel. Beren's great knife forged by treacherous Dwarven smiths, and snapped while he was attempting to remove a second Silmaril. The history of this knife varies either it was taken from the kitchens of Tevildo or later despoiled from the body of Curufin.\n\nThe poem written by Bilbo Baggins, The Hoard from The Adventures of Tom Bombadil also seems to make a nod at darker aspect of Dwarves greed as viewed from Rivendell, Elvish, and Numenorian lore concerning the heroic days at the end of the First Age (echoing bits of the tale of Turin and Mim the Dwarf) from earlier legends.\n\nIn the first part of the poem Dwarves and Dragons are compared, with implication that dwarves may have been carved from the pit (perhaps akin to the legends of men, and in Book of Lost Tales that they formed from the earth), and Dragons spawned from Hell.\n\nThe poem goes onto describe the greed and fall of the Shadow over the Elvenhome (Doriath), and the treasures they piled up in dark holes. An old dwarf (apparently Mîm the Dwarf or similar) apparently moves into the dark cave (apparently taken over from elven kings before him), with avarice, he holds onto his gotten s of silver and gold. In that cave he worked his fingers to the bone forging coins, and necklaces (described as 'strings of rings'), thought he could buy the power of the kings (he had essentially made himself a king). But as he worked his eyes grew dim and his ears dull, and his skin turned yellow on his old skull. His bony fingered claws had a pale sheen. He could no longer see the jewels he was working on. He couldn't hear the dragon (apparently \"Glaurung\") that entered his door, where he died alone in the dragon's fire, his bones were turned to ashes. Later the dragon would become old and greedy as the dwarf became and then would be slain by a warrior (Turin as noted).\n\nOne strange aspect of this version of the tale besides \"Mîm\" being killed by the Dragon, by the descriptions he may have already died. As it seems to describe his flesh decomposing from his bone before he is actually 'killed'. Yet he is ultimately slain by the dragon. Perhaps it is suggesting his greed lead to a kind of physical undeath on him, ultimately destroyed by dragon fire.\n\nThe hero then apparently the warrior becomes a king, but under his rule the weapons of his thanes became dull with rust. The kingdom's glory fell, and his rule was unjust. But king he was of the elvish gold. He hid the gold the treasure in a chest in secret treasury in the dark ground in strong iron-bound doors. All he could think of while sitting on his throne was that treasure (apparently wasting away). Out of the mountains his land was invaded killing his guards. His halls were burned, and his kingdom was lost. His bones were tossed in a cold pit. This finally left the old hoard in dark, forgotten behind doors none could unlock. At that grim gate where no one could pass grass grew on the mound where sheep fed and larks flew, and wind blew from the sea. It would remain there forever while the elves slept.\n\nThe theme of the poem is about kings falling to greed, and then ultimately into darkness, only for their treasure to be captured by a new 'ruler or king', who also falls into darkness, and the treasure falls into the hands of the next king. As if there is a curse on the treasure horde. Also noteable is that the events happen in almost reverse of how they occured in actual tale from; 1. Turin & Gloraung, 2. Mim, 3. Hurin, 4. Elves (to 1. Elves, 2. Mim, 3. Gloraung, 4. Turin (and Hurin?)). In the poem the last character described an old bearded king (apparently wasting away, or dead and skeletal) but it is unclear who this is probably the warrior from the previous lines but may be a mix of Turin and Hurin together. The references to Hell-spawned dragons appears to be taken from the poems in the The Lays of Beleriand.\n\nMuch of this tale appears to take inspiration from earlier of Tolkien's tales of Mim's cursed gold hoard (and the necklace Nauglafring ) that led to the downfall of Doriath, and the dwarven houses in the early versions of the tales.\n\nOf note the Appendices of The Lord of the Rings refers in one part refers to The Book of Lost Tales as a source for some of the information (on a topic unrelated to this subject), a note added in The Book of Lost Tales, Part II, may suggest that the \"tales of Men\" that suggest that dwarves are evil, may be in reference to the The Book of Lost Tales.\n\nThus from those Men's perspective in telling the story the dwarves involved in early history were 'evil', but it is not the case that all dwarves were evil. It may very well be the source of the idea of wicked dwarves and Goblins in alliances and not so decent dwarves as mentioned in The Hobbit. So it maybe said that some of the material is based on 'truth (but only refers to a few 'bad dwarves', or dwarves thought to be bad, rather than the dwarven race as a whole)', but incomplete knowledge of the actual events and names. Though Tolkien may have made references to earlier versions of his legends in works from periods of his creation (he was constantly revising his ideas, and thus some references may be remnants that remained behind from earlier creative ideas in the published works). What follows is additional information included in those tellings which specifically refer to the more evil dwarves (which were later divided into the Great Dwarves and the Petty-Dwarves).\n\nBeren and Lúthien (2017) reintroduces some of the material about the 'treacherous Dwarves\" back into the 'complete story' including the cursed treasure hoard and Mim, the battle in Thingol's halls, the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost and battle at Sarn Athrad, the Stony Ford, between Beren and Naugladur.\n\nThe earliest known legends suggest that Melko (Melkor) created the Uvanimor, bred from the earth, who were monsters, giants, ogres, and the Nauglath (or Nautar).The Dwarves appear to be one of the Úvanimor related to Goblins. Fangli\/Fankil\/Fukil (perhaps Sauron), the child of Melkor and his servent, entered into the world perverting men. They fought the Ilkorins (elves). The Ermon (Edain?) allied with Nuin at the Battle of Palisor (the site of the awakening of the elves). Fangli's forces were either defeated, but some may have fled away becoming wild and savage tribes who worshiped Fangli and Melkor. Thereafter Palisor was possessed by Fangli and his hosts of Nauglath (or Dwarves). Later Fankil with the Dwarves and Goblins went among Men, and bred estrangement between them and the elves; and many Men aided the Dwarves. Such that only the Ermon alone stood by the fairies (elves) in the first war of Goblins and Elves (aka Dwarves and Men).\n\nThe Nauglath (or Nautar) are the kin of the Indrafangs\/Indravangs (the Longbeards). The dwarves are a strange race and none knew exactly where the came from. They served neither Melkor, nor Manwe, and they had no concern for Elves or men. Some claim they had not heard of Iluvitar, or in hearing disbelieve. In crafts and sciences and in the knowledge of virtues of all things in the earth or under the water none excel them; yet they dwelt beneath the ground in caves and tunneled towns; Nogrod was the mightiest of these. It is said they are very old, and that no child comes among them, nor are they able to laugh. They are squat ins stature, and yet are strong, and their beards reach to their toes. However, the beards of the Indrafangs are the longest of all, forked, and they bound them to their middles as they walked abroid. All these creatures have Men called dwarves, and they say that crafts and cunning surpass that of the Gnomes (Noldor elves), there is however little beauty in their works. It is said that some of the Gnomes joined in league with the Dwarves of Nogrod. The Dwarves were freely in trade with the Noldoli selling swords, coats of mail, and other smithwork of great skill. There was a great traffic between the people, and also with the Orcs and soldiers of Melkor as well.\n\nThe dwarves desired the gold of the elves, and asked the king to allow them to work their craft on their treasuries. It was agreed under the guidance of Ufedhin the Noldoli (and his own craft skill), that the gold and one of the Silmarils would be loaned to the dwarves in Norgrod to work their skills on. To which the Dwarves claimed they would fashion things for the adornment of the king and queen such that they had never seen, nor any Gnome or Dwarf had made yet.\n\nThe king broke his agreement with Ufedhin and the dwarves, capturing them. Telling them they would remain hostages until the treasures had been returned to his halls. He mistrusted them and thought they were thieves, or that their greed would turn them into thieves. In place of Ufedhin the gold was brought to Nogrod by one of the craftmen's companions. Meanwhile Ufedhin manipulated the king with descriptions of the treasures they would make, and began to weave dark plots in order to ensnare the king in avarice and revenge for his capture.\n\nFoalókë, the dragon known  Glorund learned from spies that his enemy had born a son. His wrath was terrible and his greed kindled. He set up a guard of Orcs (and some versions also say also fallen Elves), he might trust and to watch his dwelling and his treasury. Mîm the dwarf was appointed the captain of these. As captain of the guard appointed by Glorund he was to watch the treasure in his absence. Then leaving the caves and places of his sleep he crossed the wilderness to battle Turambar and was slain (and Turambar died of his wounds).\n\nLater did Úrin, the father of Turin came to the hoard of Rodothlim as the Orcs and the guard had fled the caves at the death of Glorund, and only one dwelt there still. Mîm sat their still on the pile of gold singing black songs of enchantment to himself. But none had come yet to despoil him, for the terror had lived longer than he, and none had ventured into the caves for dread of the spirit of Glorund.  When Úrin and the elves approached he stood before the doors of that cave.\n\nThe sorcerous dwarf spoke to Urin saying that he hadn't expected to see him, a  man with the elven rabble. Then he issued a warning and a curse, telling him to not touch the gold no more than he would touch fire; for the dragon had lain long years on it and the evil of the drakes of Melko was upon it. He warned that no good could it bring to Man or Elf. For only Mim could ward it, and by many a dark spell he had bound it to himself. Urin waved at first, but anged his men to the point that he ordered them to seize it all. Mim stood by and broke forth into many terrible and evil curses. In response Urin smote him saying that although they had come only for that which was not the dwarf's, they would now take his life for the evil words he had made.\n\nAs Mim lay dieing in his final words he issued one final curse saying that Elves and Men would rue the deed, and because of his death; death would follow the gold so long as it remained on Earth. Each part or portion would share that curse as the whole. Urin shuddered, but the elves only laughed. He then ordered the elves to carry the gold away.\n\nThe tale is told that so potent were the spells that Mîm had woven about that hoard that, even as it lay upon the floor of the king\u2019s halls shining strangely in the light of the torches that burnt there, already were all who looked upon it touched by its subtle evil.\n\nWherever the gold was taken men and elves killed each other over greed of the treasure. His hall ran gore, and the gold lay before his throne. Thus did the curse of Mîm the Dwarf begin its course; and yet another sorrow sown by the Noldoli of old in Valinor was come to fruit.\n\nLater the curse of Mim fell on Tinwelint (Thingol) after he put the Nauglafring around his neck. The death of Mim also lead to the two dwarven clans invading Atanar to avenge the dead dwarf, with treachery of another elf who had fallen to the curse. They invaded Artanor (Doriath) slaying the elven king taking the necklace..\n\nHearing of the death of Mim, at the hand of Urin (Hurin) and the rape of Glorund's gold from Bodruith, new wrath was kindled to their lust, and Naugladur vowed to never rest until Mim was thriced avenged, and more he believed the gold belonged to the people of the Dwarves.\n\nThis then was the design; and by his deeds did the Dwarves ever been severed in feud with the elves since those days, and drawn more in nigh in friendship to the kin of Melkor. He sent a secret missive telling the Indrafangs prepare their host for a coming day of his choosing, when the time was ripe. At that time Belegost began a bitter forging of steel in preparation. Meanwhile Naugladur gathered about him a great host of of the Orcs, and wandering goblins, promising them a good wage, and the pleasure of their Master moreover, and a rich booty at the end. He armed the mercenaries with his own weapons. Narthseg, one of Tintwelint's elves came to Naugladur and offered his services to lead the hosts against the magics of Gwendelin, for the elf had also been bitten by the gold-lust of Glorund's hoard (Mim's curse had first come upon Tintwelint and treachery first arose among the elves of Artanor (Doriath)).\n\nThus the dwarves had proven ignoble, prone to evil to gain their ends, and were exclusively impelled by greed; that Doriath should be lain waste by mercenary Orcs under Dwarvish paymasters.\n\nThen the curse came to rest among his kin. This lead to infighting and murder between the two clans. It wasn't until necklace was drowned in the sea that the curse was appeased.\n\nNot long after the formation of Isle of Íverin from the western half off Tol Eressëa near the Great Lands the Battle of Rôs occurs.  The Island-elves and the Lost Elves fought against against Nautar, Gongs, Orcs, and a few evil Men. The elves were defeated. The fading Elves retired back Tol Eressëa and hid in the woods. Men came to Tol Eressëa and also the evil Orcs, Dwarves, Gongs, Trolls, etc. The elves continued to faded with sorrow no longer able to breath the air of the men who were their equals or greater; and men became more powerful and numerous. The fairies grew small and tenuous, filmy and transparent, while the men became larger and more dense, and could no longer see the fairies.\n\nIn the Book of Lost Tales, the Dwarves are always portrayed as an evil people and neutral at best.Evil or neutral they traded with both sides (including with the forces of Melkor). The term 'dwarf-natured' (nauglafel) meaning mean, avaricious, representing the personality of the dwarves as viewed by others (this is not entirely outside the bounds of opinions of Dwarves by other races in later years, by those who do not fully understand them). As noted previously, greed-induced by the Dwarven Rings of Power, and some hostility with the Free Peoples could be seen as mean and full of avarice. It is noted that even in published Silmarillion they are portrayed as having dour and hidden natures in their 'unloveliness'.\n\nThe term Nauglath (or Nautaur) appears to be both a term for Dwarves in general, and possibly also those later known as Petty-dwarves. The Indravang refers to those later known as the Longbeards.\n\nIn these early poems, it is said that dwarfs originally dwelled in the burning South from Nogrod.  But also lived in the east in black Belegost. They included the Longbeard dwarves whose locks were the longest and tallest on earth. They are smiths and wrights known for making dark weapons though powerful often known to betray their wielders. These include daggers, knives, hauberds, and even arrows. It is also said that dwarvish darts were cruely hooked. The lands were also known to have berries which the Dwarves made into wine and brought north by long ways to the lands where it was enjoyed by the elves of Thingol's realm. They also made a golden crown for Tinwelint (Thingol), who previously only worn a wreath of scarlet leaves.\n\nThe treacherous smiths of Nogrod also made the blade used by Curufin, a cunning blade of dwarvish steel with hard edge, and bitter cold. Many Nogrod songs were told of it. How dwarvish armourers long ago sung slow enchantments over it, where their hammers fell (hammer songs) like the sound of a bell. It clove iron like tender wood and through mail like wool.  It was wielded by Flinding\/Gwindor\/ Beren  to cut a silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Even Morgoth's gleaming coat of armor was made of rings of steel no arrow could pierce, made of web of dwarvish craft. He was able to break a silmaril free from iron claws that held it, but the knife snapped betraying him to Morgoth when he went for a second gem.\n\nFunding was captured and had no way to free himself except a dagger forged of dwarven steel his prized possession, and could cut through iron noiselessly. It had been wrought by the wrights in the realms of the East in black Belegost, by the bearded Dwarves. But the dagger betrayed him slipping from its sheath into the grass.\n\nBeren also defend himself with a grey hauberk of dwarvish craft made in Nogrod; the hammers rang in cavern's when it was forged. The heirloom of his family the Dragon-helm was crafted by Telchar in Belegost in the dark dwarfland in the deeps of time.\n\nThe hostile dwarves captured one known as Blodrin. He was an elf, the son of Bor. As a child the bearded dwarves dragged him to their deep mansions, and in Nogrod he was nurtured and tought to spite his blood and birth. To hate both elves and Men. He joined Turin's outlaws, but lusted for treasure (his greed for gold was great as great as the dwarves he had been raised within), but he hated Hurin's offspring and the bowman Beleg. He  fled their fellowship and forest dwellings and allied with Orcs. He bargained with them for gold, and thus he betrayed his fellowship to the Orcs in the forest hideouts. The traitor and the orcs killed many men through treachery. Turin was captured. Beleg was buried in a pile of bodies, but escaped death. But in the end Blodin was killed by a poisoned arrow to the throat held fastly to the tree behind him.\n\nThe sinister effect of Elvish association with the wicked dwarves had on Blodrin followed after that as it had done to Ufedhin.\n\nThe story of Turin's traitor went throughs several revisions, ultimately apparently became the basis for the emergence of Mim as the traitor of the outlaws who had allied with the orcs, and betrayed their location.\n\nIn the The Shaping of Middle-earth, The elves came to the Blue Mountains. There they made war with the Nauglir (Dwarves) of Nogrod and Belegost (but the elves did not know where race had come from originally). The dwarves were not friend of Valar' or of Eldar or of Men, nor do they serve Morgoth; though they are in many things more like his people, and little did they love the Gnomes (Noldor). The Indrafangs (Longbeards) dwelt in Nogrod. The dwarves little troubled the peoples of the earth as long as the Gnomes remained great.\n\n\"Mim the Dwarf\" is just a byline he was a random dwarf who found the halls of Nargothrond and treasure unguarded. He took possession Glorung's gold after the dragon had been killed.  He in joy fingering the gold and gems, and letting them run through his hands. While there he had enchanted all the gold with many spells which bound them to himself (a nod back to the black songs and curses he made on the gold as wards while he was the Captain of the dragon's guard). But it is said that the folk of Mim were very few. Out of lust for the treasure Hurin's outlaws slew them, though Hurin would have stayed them (this version adds more than one dwarf with Mim).  \n\nHurin and his band came to the hoard, and all slew Mim, nd at his death Mim cursed the gold. The outlaws took the the hoard  (in these versions many were involved in taking the gold instead of just one, though he left out this group in some later revisions at the time). The curse came upon the outlaws each one died or were slain in quarrels upon the road. Hurin sought aid from Thingol's elves carry the treasure the rest of the way and cast it at the feet of Thingol.\n\nHurin brought the gold Doriath and dropped it before Thingol's feet in anger (he is sent away). The enchantment curse takes hold on Thingol, he summons dwarves from Nogrod and Belegost to make him a necklace for the Silmaril. The dwarves who had been instantly struck by the lust and and desire for the treasure plotted treachery because they believed it was the right of dwarves as it had been stolen from Mim. Because Thingol bitter due to the curse denied them their reward. The two races began to throw bitter words at each other, and there was a battle in Thingol's halls. Many elves and dwarves were slain, and the howe wherein they were laid in Doriath was named Cum-nan-Arasaith, the Mound of Avarice. But the remaining dwarves were driven out without payment or reward. The Dwarves returned aided by treachery of the Gnomes (other elves) who were also bitten by the lust of gold. They surprise Thingol on a hunt and kill him, and sacked Doriath. The dwarves are ambushed later and slain. In this version Beren keeps the necklace though warned of the curse, and the gold is drowned. The curse later goes on to causing more elf on elf war. Only hint of Mim's character comes from the fact that he enchanted the gold (but it doesn't specifically show him to be evil).\n\nThis version maintains a touch of the idea of Dwarves being treacherous and this is amplified by the curse on the gold, and that they are said to be like Morgoth's people (in the early Quenta). The Noldor who betray Thingol and help the dwarves appear to be a reference actions of Ufedhin in the Lost Tales (though he is not specifically mentioned).\n\nThe book also contains a couple of other note later versions in which the dwarves are further seperated from Morgoth, and also less warlike in the initial appearances in Middle-earth instead both elves and dwarves 'conversed' with each other (apparently having trade together), though Mim's curse still existed to varying degrees in these versions leading to wars between Thingol and the dwarves. Some of the early stuff was modified into the Petty-dwarves, while other stuff was changed and became more neautral & peaceful dwarves.\n\nIn the Lost Road, Mîm is only briefly mentioned in the Annals, similar to earlier version; Again Mîm is just a random dwarf that had taken over Nargothrond hoard. Hurin slew the dwarf (there is no mention of any others with him), but the dwarf had cursed the treasure, and it is brought to Thingol. Thingol employs dwarves to craft him the Nauglamir. Emnity awakens between dwarves and elves, and he sends them away. The dwarves and elves from Belegost and Nogrod return in force and invade Doriath. They were allowed in by treacherous elves who had been smitten by the curse. Thingol is slain in the caves. Dwarves are later ambushed, Beren keeps the necklace, and gold is thrown into the river. Later kinstrife occurs although this version it is not ascribed to the curse. This version is very brief and does not go into detail of the emnity, though curse appears to be at least partially involved.\n\nNot much here other than its specified that the Dwarves believed to have been made by Aule, their attitude is always 'cool', but initially had no griefs with the elves. So roughly The Longbeards of Belegost helped build Menegroth. But otherwise the materials in these books maintains them as largely 'neutral' at this point.\n\nThe concept of sinister or cursed dwarven weapons that betray their masters such as Beren's knife Angrist is hinted at in the The Grey Annals and other related materials written in the 1950s both before LOTR and shortly after.\n\nThere is brief additional material about the Petty-Dwarfs and their enmity between Eldar. Mim's story is told again covers the curse of the treasure, and how the treasure brought deaths to Hurin's men, and later to Doriath, and a few references to the battles at the Stony Ford (Sarn Athrad) between Green Elves, Beren, and greed-induced Dwarves. It seems by 1963 Tolkien had plans to reintroduce this plotpoint from the Lost Tales back into his version of the story, but this story along with the cursed treasure is largely left out of the Silmarillion.\n\nChristopher notes that he had ignored some of the elements of the Ruin of Doriath from the original earlier materials which included dwarves entering through the magic Girdle around Doriath with help of traitorous elves on the inside, to go with the idea that it was completely an inside job by from dwarves already working inside the city. He had at first thought it would be an impossible job to rectify these two opposing details, but in hindsight and realizing his father was still developing a new idea that may have been using concepts from both accounts (allowing for dwarves bypass the veil with help from traitorous elves, as well as dwarves on the inside turning on the elves as well).\n\nThe only other big issue is that there are two jarringly different accounts of Thingol's death either in the caves or outside the caves as he tries to flee from the Dwarves, and its unclear which of these versions Tolkien would have settled upon. Christopher discusses in one set of notes his father had started to work on a possible explanation that would have brought back the earlier death description, somehow Thingol would have to have been lured outside the caves or induced to go to war beyond the borders (perhaps only having been injured in the caves), and that it was outside where he was truly slain.\n\nHe felt he could have, and should have been able to reconcile all of these events without overstepping his editorial function.\n\nBeren and Luthien (2017) takes elements of these accounts and tries to reconcile them somewhat, but with little editorial work. They don't necessarily 'combine' perfectly, but there is a at least a kind of framework in the order of the stories to try to explain it, and with Christopher's own commentary in between. It does reintroduce the concept of the traitor elf and dwarves being allowed in through the Girdle, reworking it back into the overall story, and Thingol's later death during a 'hunt'.\n\nContains a reference to the ancient enmity between Dwarf and Elf and neither would learn the other's tongue. Not exactly 'darkness' in the dwarves, but does show petty feud between the two races. That leads to some to write many of them off as being 'treacherous'...\n\nAnother section under the \"Appendix on Languages\" described dwarves as being a bit greedy and holding grudges (but unlikely to willful evil nor the sevrents of the enemy).\n\nThat being said there are some negative traits that are discussed (which as the passage explains may lead to their reputation of being bad sorts...), first par des a hard thrawn folk for the most part. Thrawn has a definition that might be seen as a tad dark.\n\n1. twisted; crooked. \"a slightly thrawn neck\" 2. perverse; ill-tempered. \"mother's looking a bit thrawn this morning\"\n\nMuch of the later references compare them as greedy and holding a brudge. But backs off them being entirely evil.\n\nIt also has a small section discussing the dwarves that dwarves are likely to treat people they are devoted to more briskly for maintaining a sense for revenge.\n\nThe term 'wicked dwarves' originates from the Hobbit in reference to certain dwarves that made alliances with goblins, and there is also a reference to less decent dwarves as well.\n\nIn discussing The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings this article is concerned with the latest editions published by Tolkien later after he incorporated further revisions in later reprints and he his ideas changed and evolved. Some revisions were minor, others changed details in major ways. Some of these changes are discussed in the notes section (below) if it offers a better understanding  how the books both referenced previously material, but also evolved to fit with later ideas as he continued to revise his work.\n\nAn important note for Home XI and XII contains material and essays that was contained the later revisions by JRR Tolkien. At least as up to date on the topics had been written until his death. These were ones that were used in putting together Silmarillion or were discovered by Christopher later (and may include changes he didn't incorporate). But as such they are more useful for the main background sections of this topic. By that point the concept of petty-dwarves and great Dwarves (and details such as character names) were largely settled. Most of the material was written during or after LOTR was published, and thus does not directly reference any of the older material other than what it revised from (and less likely to contradict the The Lord of the Rings itself).\n\nHoMEI-V is less useful in the main background section as it is based on material that predates The Hobbit up to about the time the book had been written. The majority of the information may have been the basis for many of the references made in the Hobbit (as discussed in the The History of the Hobbit). Some of the earliest material was clearly revised by the Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. Most of this information is extremely important for a better understanding of the changes and to acknowledge some of the early ideas of 'wicked dwarves'. As well as highlight certain 'wicked dwarves' that got edited out of later stories or drastically changed allegiences. However most of this material is less reliable in relation to LOTR or some of the material in Unfinished Tales which incorporated included  later revised material..\n\nHistory of the Hobbit is particularly useful in that gives some of the reasoning behind certain references in the hobbit, and included in the notes section below.\n\nHoMEVI-VIII are The Lord of the Rings related and thus built clearly on the \"friendly\" dwarves and largely to the drafts of the main story. Thus it less helpful as a resource as the drafts are very different than the final released story.\n\nThe Silmarillion contains a mix of material that was written by JRR Tolkien (before LOTR and some after), as well as a few things that were constructs by Christopher Tolkien and Guy Kay (in particular The Ruin of Doriath). It includes materials that were not reprinted in the HoMe series nor Unfinished Tales (but noted in that series where it exists). Other material written post-LOTR was apparently avoided because it was in a different format (poetry vs. essay\/prose) and would have required too much work to incorporate, and would have less of JRR Tolken because of it. In some cases the earlier material was different later material. In worst case they were force to construct material where there was very little or only the oldest sources (thus are not necessarily the direction Christopher's father would have taken). As such there may be remnants of the older darker dwarfs peaking under the surface that may have been further edited out if JRR had had the chance or better explained.\n\nUnfinished Tales is more of a cross between HoMe VI-XII in that it contains incomplete material with Christopher's explanations. Although it is more edited than in HoME series to be more accessible (it is more intended to fill in gaps of the history of the world than just be scholarly account of development and revisions by his father). It includes material from all three ages of the world. While many of the texts are \"unfinished \" they were chosen because missing bits are contained or the materiais its within material published in The Hobbit, LOTR and The Silmarillion offering a more complete history of the universe. Most of the material represents latest versions JRR had written but that did not contradict the main Middle-earth series as a whole but expand on it; but in some cases it include revised information or alternat accounts than those made in The Silmarillion (1977). As such it is intended to be part of the core series and companion to The Silmarillion. It is largely only useful to this topic in so much it gives a different and more detailed account of Mim's history at least up to his betrayal of Turin. Although some details are missing (part of the incomplete nature of the versions included).\n\nThe Children of Hurin is a complete story combined from various sources of the story published previously or from further discoveries made since the release of HoME and fills in gaps of the story left out in previous released versions. Thus it is intended to be the most detailed and accessible version of the story. It includes a more expanded account than the version included in The Silmarillion some cases revising the account there-in. It is mainly useful only as far as information about Mim which gives a more complete account of his time with the outlaws, and restores sime of his darker traits, and also more detailed information about the cursed Elven\/Dwarven sword and later reformed and wielded by Turin.\n\nBeren and Lúthien is a combination of various tales and poems from various points in Tolkien's development, released together more 'complete' version of the tale. It further reintroduces quite a bit of the material concerning 'treacherous Dwarves\" from Lost Tales, Lay of Leithien, and other sources. Like Children of Hurin it 'fills' in gaps in previous versions of the story and also puts them together in a more chronological state. However due to the fractured nature of the Beren and Luthien's story it tends to have more 'editor' notes interspersed throughout (and sometimes conflicting details Beren is both an Elf and Man depending on the portion of the story being told in the book, and its source, Christopher made no attempt to edit materials to fit with the 'latest' versions of the story). Due to the fractured nature of the materials and the evolution of ideas this book contains more editorial explanations than Children, and is somewhat closer to Unfinished Tales in that regards.\n\nIn addition the term 'wicked dwarves as mentioned before there is an offhanded remark in relation to dwarves and their emnity with the elves that ponts out there is a difference between 'decent dwarves' and other dwarves (who are apparently not so decent).\n\nThough the reason for their dislike is rather 'tame' is inspired by frivolous elves in the Book of Lost Tales and The Father Christmas Letters of Edwardian and Georgian fairy sentimentality. Their personality as shown in the hobbit represented the last appearance of \"elves as faeries\" in the main line of the legendarium, as Tolkien focused later primarily on medieval style elves. (in comparison to the more mature writings later written).\n\nStill less petty reasons for the distrust is explained later on in the hobbit by a reference back to the Sack of Doriath and the death of Thingol.\n\nAn early draft of the Hobbit when Tolkien 's dwarves underwent a transformation into 'decent enough people', if \"commercial-minded\" states in regards to goblins and dwarves;\n\nThis may have been a reference to early versions of the The Fall of Gondolin in which Goblins fought alongside balrogs and dragons in sacking Gondolin, and goblin-mercenaries aiding dwarves in looting Artanor (precursor to Thingol's Thousand Caves of Menegroth in Doriath) from The Book of Lost Tales.\n\nFurther aspects of the dwarves association in the past with darkness as spellcasters and sorcerers of dark curses and malefic magic (as seen in the story of Mim) in an early draft the book described;\n\nThis is only hinted at in the final version;\n\nIn some of Tolkien's earliest writings Dwarves were a mostly evil race created by Melko\/Melkor, as seen in the The Book of Lost Tales. In those early versions there were but two races of dwarves (a concept that made it into early drafts of the Hobbit, and even the first edition published, though later revised to seven)..But this idea was revised in later writings (and line removed in second edition of the hobbit). A few of these ideas were reused in the history of the Petty-dwarves. Although they were not necessarily evil (however selfish and would make deals with any side to protect their own lives), but misunderstood tragic individuals hunted by those who thought them monsters or stupid creatures.\n\nIn The History of the Hobbit it is ntoed that the The Book of Lost Tales is filled with 'elvish' bias (and thus is more anti-dwarf, than the more equitable narrative in The Hobbit). Thus like the explanation stories told by Men that denegrated Dwarves accusing them of evil, so to did the elves tell negative stories about the dwarves as well. Which may explain why some of the early stories paints the dwarves in a more negative light.\n\nIt is also mentioned in the History of the Hobbit, that the Hobbit predates the stories of Aule's creations of the dwarves in the Quenta (written and revised between Hobbit and LOTR or after the LOTR). Thus it makes references to some of the earlier legends in earlier versions of the Quenta or Lost Tales on the formation of the dwarves. As such while it may have been written after he was moving away from the idea that the Dwarves were created from the earty by Melko\/Morgoth. He still was toying with the idea of dwarves having been formed from stone (and returning to stone in death), and it is mentioned within the text. The story did however lean away from Dwarves having any connection to Melkor but more of a neutral race tied to no powers (he had been moving into early versions of the Quenta at the time). However, the story does make some of the earliest references to female dwarves (\"nieces\" and the mother of Fili and Kili) suggesting that they do not all arise from stone. In The Lord of the Rings the idea that they were formed from stone would be described to be rumors and legends by other races, and not based the the truth as they know it.  \n\nIn many of the early writings Dwarves are said to be created by \"Melko', or at least moved closer to friendship with him. Inbetween it is ambiguoulsy suggested they came out of stone spontaeously. It was only later in development following the Hobbit that the ideas of Aule creating them was introduced. Ironically it is said that Aule and Melkor are actaully the two Valar that are closest to each other in personality and skill. Both sought to 'create' life of their own. Both created (or case of Morgoth 'corrupted') life that was in the image and likeness of their creators. But only Aule never worked against Illuvitar interfere or destroy what Eru was creating. But ironically in an indirect way the dwarves would share likeness to Morgoth, if only in the way Aule was similar to him. But Dwarves were also both like and unlike elves and men as well, and made resistant to Morgoth's will. This is alluded to in the The War of the Jewels in the The Later Quenta Silmarillion;\n\nIn earlier versions of the Silmarillion as detailed in The History of Middle-earth series, Mîm the Dwarf was a much more evil character, who was a minion of Glaudring, and actively betrayed Túrin (the latter idea was resurrected in the complete published The Children of Hurin). But as dwarves gradually changed in Tolkien's writings from evil orc-like beings to the dwarves they later became, Mîm's character was changed, and in the final texts he is no longer a true villain, but almost a tragic character in his own right. However, the Children of Hurin restores some of the darker aspects of Mim's story and his selfish and evil nature, and turning towards the darkness, but leaves some details ambiguous referencing two versions of the same account in the same story with an account more sympathetic to the dwarf in the footnotes.\n\nDwarves become actively involved on the side of Melko, during the Battle of Palisor, the death of King Tinwelent, and the Fall of Gondolin in the earliest writings. Though at times they seem to be working of their own will, and betray others, and befriending other evil forces. This is described as \"drawn more nigh in friendship to the kind of Melko.\"\n\nThese dwarves do not appear to always be evil, but sometimes neutral, they are said to neither serve Melko nor Manwe. But they start to lean ever closer to Melko due to their avarice, greed, and sense of revenge to anyone who wrongs them. This ultimately leads to them towards darkness and they are always at odds with the elves for all times to come. The neutral evil persists in Tolkien's writings as late as some of the material associated with the Lost Road.\n\nThe Shaping of Middle-earth, The War of the Jewels, and The History of the Hobbit notes that Tolkien had to essentially turn his older more evil dwarf race (of two races) into a new race to separate them from the newer more pleasant Seven Houses;\n\nThis became important in later revisions in that elves encounter dwarves in which they don't necessarilly love have general peace and trade with. In contrast to those they went to war with the moment they saw them. The former became the dwarves of  Nogrod  & Belegost dwarves, and the treacherous ones became the Petty-dwarves.\n\nThe Wanderings of Hurin contains very little material concerning Mim, and while it may have included the latest revisions and updated information about Hurin. It was still predated some of the other material about Mim. Some of the notes appears to have the first references to 'petty-dwarves' that tolkien ever made, when he decided to convert dwarves into two races from the good ones and the bad ones. The chronology include, probably one of the last references Tolkien made to Hurin killing Mim. In the descriptions while no curse on the treasure is directly mentioned (as in earlier versions) it does include the idea that Hurin and his men took the whole treasure out of the hoard and not just Nauglamir as told in the published Silmarillion. The chronology however ends before Thingol is killed (thus no details about the dwarven conflict).\n\nSeveral things of note from this later published versions of Mim's story as they appear in the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Children of Hurin, and the latter two books of the HoMe series (Wanderings of Hurin). Is that Petty-dwarves are portrayed as a race of dwarves that was actively neutral in the War hating both sides. Having decended from some of the more ill-virtued of dwarves who had been exiled for their slothful, and rebellious, and darker behaviour. They were selfish and greedy, stealthy and treacherous (ambushing others from darkness and night). But they were also more concerned with their own success and well-being and willing to betray others in order to stay alive. They are also willingly issue dark curses on those who injure them. The Children of Hurin leaves things somewhat more ambiguous mentioning both tales that Mim was ambitious, devious and with a mind for betrayal, as well as greedy willing to turn over others for riches, whose heart had darkened and he had become evil (but also sympathetically mentions that some tales suggest that his betrayal was initially unintended). He is however, not as dark as the lieutenant figure who guarded Glaurung's treasure, and used dark magic to curse treasures with wards. Even still there is the question if he ever did put the curse on the treasure upon his death at Huron's hands.\n\nIn the Silmarillion it notes that dwarves may fight among themselves and any other race;\n\nThe reference to dwarves fighting among themselves may be a remnant of a reference to those dwarves such as the Petty-dwarves that were exiled, and it may also be a remnant reference to the two clans of the Lost Tales who ended up fighting each other after the curse of Mim struck. Indeed the term \"Naugrim\" is derived from the Nauglath in Tolkien's earlier version (and the Nauglath themselves became the Petty-dwarves). The feuds between the kindreds of dwarves had all been erased with the loss of the story of Ufedhin and theft of Necklace from the Lord of Nogrod, and the killing of the Lord of Belegost in later stories, and the fighting between the two clans of dwarves.\n\nThe killing of Tinwelint by the Nauglith and Indrafang in revenge was revised in later and published versions of the Silmarillion as the Nauglim dwarves of Norgrod taking revenge on Thingol. Though some of the particulars were different. The revenge in former was over the death of Mim (and a few other insults). In the later it was due to an insult by Thingol who refused to pay what he had promised the dwarves. A remnant of darkness of the former stories are alluded to in that the dwarves in their greed are thought to covet the silmaril and his treasures. While the dwarves resorted to hiring orcs and ogres to attack Doriath, there is no evidence of this in later and final published version of the story.\n\nIn the The Lays of Beleriand Christopher Tolkien notes, that there is was a sinister effect of Elvish association with Dwarves in the early stories giving the examples of Blodrin and Ufedhin he mentions it is not altogether absent in the tale of Eöl and Maeglin as it appears in The Silmarillion. In that tale the Dark Elf and his son spend much time with the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost forging dark weapons and armor (similar in description to the weapons in the The Lays of Beleriend and wielded by Beren in one of the stories in The Shaping of Middle-earth). One of these weapons a javelin proved to be poisonous. His son would later go to betray Gondolin to Sauron. Blodrin was revised into Blodren in the later The Gray Annals an Easterling.\n\nThe concept of sinister or cursed dwarven weapons that betray their masters such as Beren's knife Angrist appears throughout the earlier material and even hinted at in the The Grey Annals written in the 1950s after LOTR.\n\nMim's curse is a concept that appeared in some the early writings including the Lost Tales but is not mentioned in the Silmarillion by Christopher Tolkien and the co-author Guy Kay, and thus is not wholey J.R.R. Tolkien. In that construct the Dwarves were already in Doriath. They chose to murder Thingol under their own greed and lust for his treasures, the necklace and the Silmaril (which in a way paints them in a darker light than even one under influence of a 'curse'). Christopher and Guy Kay also took the liberty of removing the other individuals in Hurin's band from the story in their adaptation in the Silmarillion as well, which removed their part in the role of the curse (as well as most of the treasure hoard).\n\nThis story was not lightly or easily conceived, but was the outcome of long experimentation among alternative conceptions. In this work Guy Kay took a major part, and the chapter that I finally wrote owes much to my discussions with him. It is, and was, obvious that a Step was being taken of a different order from any other 'manipulation' of my father's own writing in the course of the book: even in the case of the story of The Fall of Gondolin, to which my father had never returned, something could be contrived without introducing radical changes in the narrative. It seemed at that time that there were elements inherent in the story of the Ruin of Doriath as it stood that were radically incompatible with 'The Silmarillion' as projected, and that there was here an inescapable choice: either to abandon that conception, or else to alter the story. I think now that this was a mistaken view, and that the undoubted difficulties could have been, and should have been, surmounted without so far overstepping the bounds of the editorial function.-The War of the Jewels, \"The Tale of Years\".\n\nWhile the The Children of Hurin reintroduces many of the darker ideas from Mim's story ends, it ends before the events of Hurin and Mim's encounter.\n\nThe nature of the publication of Beren and Luthien introduces almost all elements of Mim's curse and much of the treachery of the dwarves of Belegost and Nogrod from the The Tale of Naugrafling (although it only briefly touches on Hurin's and Mim's encounter), it follows the treasure as it reaches Doriath, and Beren's battle at the Stony Ford where the treasure was lost. But Beren and Luthien is a fractured mix of materials from different eras of publication roughly placed in continuous order of narrative. So some of the continuity is messy (Beren's racial status fluctuates between elf and human depending on the chapter in the book).\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Online includes the Dourhands.\n\nThe Eastern Dwarfs is a book series about the four dwarf houses in the far east of Middle-earth.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Wicked_dwarves"}}

Smaug was drawn towards the enormous wealth amassed by the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain during the reign of King Thror, and laid waste to the neighboring city of Dale and captured the Lonely Mountain, driving the surviving Dwarves into exile.","His origin was unknown although it was rather unlikely that he was one of survivors in the War of Wrath.","Returning to the treasure chamber, Bilbo attempted to steal a single cup, but its theft is immediately noticed by Smaug, who awakens from his slumber. Amused by the Hobbit, Smaug converses with Bilbo, attempting to deduce his origins and purpose in the mountain. He quickly surmises that Bilbo was aiding Thorin and the rest of the Dwarf company in an attempt to steal back the Arkenstone and reclaim the Mountain. Smaug flies into a rage, erupting from the mountain in a fiery wrath and loosening his flame upon the land. He flies to Lake-town upon the Long Lake and devastates it. In the midst of the wreck, Bard the Bowman, heir to the throne of Dale, does his best to rally men to repel the dragon's assault. Bard, guided by his knowledge of Smaug's secret weakness, fires a black arrow into the beast's vulnerable spot on his belly. Roaring in fury and pain, Smaug falls from the sky and crashes into the flaming ruins of Lake-town, his death signaled the end of the presence of dragons in Middle Earth. ","It is said that a vast fortune in gemstones lay with Smaug's rotting carcass amongst the pilings of old Lake-town, but few had the courage to dive for them in later years. With no Dragon to contend with, the survivors of the town rebuilt on dry land next to the lake.","The diphthong \"au\" in Smaug is pronounced like the \"ou\" in sound or house, though the name is often erroneously pronounced Smog, most notably in the Rankin\/Bass animated movie.","During the conversation between Smaug and Bilbo, Bilbo calls him several names and epithets, such as Smaug the:","It is unclear whether Smaug, the largest specimen in the Third Age, would compete in mightiness to his ancestors of average size in the First Age, though he was clearly smaller than Ancalagon, the largest known dragon to have existed.","Being a fully-grown dragon, Smaug was both massive and powerful, possessing physical strength capable of crushing stone with ease, as seen by his attack on the Lonely Mountain. He was able to fly thanks to his large wings, and had the ability to breathe streams of searing hot flame from his mouth. Some comments in The Hobbit imply that his entire body was imbued with fire, as he was seen to glow in the darkness of the Lonely Mountain's depths, and his usual paths were said to have been \"smoothed and slimed\" (i.e. melted) by his passage.","Later on, Smaug tried to take away Bilbo's friendship with Thorin by lying to him, claiming that the dwarf was using him and found his fate worth nothing, but the hobbit refused to believe him. Smaug was intrigued by his word and wanted to know what reward Thorin was willing to give him if he succeeded in finding the Arkenstone before stating that he would never give away any of treasure, not even a single coin. During the game, Smaug discerned the hobbit's attempt at stealing the jewel and kept Bilbo from catching the Arkenstone, boasting about his superiority. During the chase, Smaug showed Bilbo his underbelly, coated in gems, and the hobbit caught a glimpse of a single missing scale. Smaug then caught Bilbo's eye on the jewel and claimed that he was almost tempted to let him take it, only to let it consume Thorin to madness just like it did to Thrór, though, at that point, the dragon ended the banter with Bilbo and snapped toward the hobbit. Bilbo used his ring to escape and managed to get the Arkenstone while Smaug flew around in rage and unleashed a torrent of flames around the treasure chamber in an attempt to roast the Hobbit alive before he can escape.","It is possible that he can change how his fire-breath comes out, depending on the situation. In the first film, his fire was more liquid and napalm-like, which had enough power and mass to shatter stone buildings, and its blast could spread on the ground. In the second film, his fire is similar to a more typical fire, flamethrower-like, with immense firepower, enough to engulf his whole body. It is possible that his breath in the second movie was normal fire because his priority was to kill the intruders, and not to cause destruction, and to protect his treasures as well as not risk having the mountain fall down on him. Likewise, since most of Lake-Town consist of wood as opposed to the stone buildings of Dale, Smaug wouldn't need to rely on his flames to cause destruction, but just watch it spread. Even with that limitation, though, his single breath was enough to reignite the great forges of Erebor.","In the film adaptations, Smaug dramatically increased in size. His actual size was unknown until his image, next to a Boeing 747, was revealed to be 54 meters in length. However, this was the length of the painting itself, not his actual size. There are estimations of him to be longer than 60 meters in length and wider than 50 meters in wingspan based on comparisons with the dwarf coins. However, in the comments of Made in the Makings, his size is mentioned to be 130 meters in length and \"bigger than two jumbo jets\".","Unlike in the books, Smaug gives no mention to his tail or fiery breath during his speech to Bilbo, nor does he use either to smash the mountainside before he flies to Laketown, although he does breathe fire during the battle with the dwarves.","Smaug in this version was mentioned to be 'Slag', 'the ancient monster of the Earth'. He was slain by Bilbo, Thorin's company, and 'Princess Mika' (an original character who was one of three survivors from Elebor and Esgaroth along with Thorin) by shooting a large arrow, with the heart-shaped Arkenstone serving as the arrowhead, from a ballista.","In the 1977 animated version of The Hobbit, Smaug was voiced by Richard Boone, and his head looked wolf-like.","See here: Smaug\/Image Gallery"],"name":"Smaug","description":"Smaug is portrayed as being psychopathic, extremely sadistic, confident, violent, cruel, arrogant, intelligent and greedy, possessing an unquenchable desire for gold. His most distinguishing characteristic (aside from his greed) is his arrogance, as Smaug proudly boasts of his superiority and impregnability to Bilbo during their encounter. However, this proves to be his downfall, as he unwittingly reveals the weak spot in his chest to Bilbo when showing the Hobbit how he had willfully coated his underbelly in treasure to protect it.\n\nSmaug seems primarily motivated by personal greed rather than a desire to do evil, and does not seem to serve any allegiance other than his own. While he does ruthlessly destroy Dale and lays waste to the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain during his attack on the Lonely Mountain, once he has assumed dominion of the region he seems content to allow the rest of Middle Earth to go about its business, so long as he or his treasure remains undisturbed; although this could be because he feels that the people living in the region have nothing he wants. Highly intelligent, Smaug appears to possess a rather sardonic sense of humor, darkly mocking Bilbo while they converse within the Lonely Mountain's treasure chamber. Smaug seems to dislike Dwarves, considering them to be weak and pathetic creatures far beneath him, making unfavorable comments about Thror and showing no remorse over his slaughter of their kind and claiming of their kingdom. While conversing with Bilbo, Smaug is also able to quickly surmise the reason for Bilbo's presence in Erebor, and also correctly deduces that the Dwarves received aid from the men of Esgaroth in reaching the mountain.\n\nWhile his personality is more or less the same as the book, in the movie, Smaug is considerably more malicious and cruel. He takes much more pleasure in psychologically tormenting Bilbo, making suggestions that Thorin was just using him, that flattery wouldn't keep him alive, choosing to spare Bilbo just so that he can watch Lake-town burn and showing pleasure that Bilbo cared about the people of Laketown and tell him that their deaths would be on his head, and sarcastically asking him how he would like to die. During his attack on Lake-town, Smaug went out of his way to mock and sneer at Bard and Bain. He was also aware of the return of Sauron, and was apparently intent on joining forces with him (although there was some amount of confusion as to whether the dragon would ever ally with Sauron without any reward). Like his book counterpart, Smaug is extremely arrogant, and the mere implication that he may possess a weakness made him visibly angry; being insulted by Thorin was also quick to earn his anger. Smaug was supremely confident in his own powers, shown in his famous speech about how certain components of his body were weapons of destruction. He was utterly ruthless, completely capable of committing genocide in pursuit of his goals. Due to his hubris, egomania, and overall extreme narcissism, Smaug clearly suffers from a superiority complex.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Smaug"}}

Based on descriptions in The Hobbit, the Orcs of the Misty Mountains had some control over the Wargs living there. However, most Warg riders were loyal to the evil leaders of Mordor.\n\nIn the The Two Towers film, Saruman sends out Warg riders, under the command of Sharku, to attack the people of Edoras as they travel to Helm's Deep.\n\nIn The Return of the King as well, Gothmog rides a warg, but only for transportation.\n\nTheir armor was unique to the Warg-riders, and unique within the group; some, such as their leader (allegedly named Sharku, perhaps in reference to his great age) wore little beyond bone and fur, whereas others preferred to be more heavily protected, wearing multiple layers of rotting hide, fur and hair or mail, but nearly all included something from the remains of the Warg's kill, such as bone and tooth, and from parts of the Warg itself. Keeping their weight down was a factor with most in order not to tire the Warg.\n\nSharku's relative lack of protection may have been a status symbol; as the leader and longest-surviving member of the pack, he may have been demonstrating that he needed no barrier between himself and the monsters they shared their lives with.\n\nTheir cuirass was often made from the bones of a horse's rib cage, to which was stitched pieces of hide and fur; during centuries of wear \u2014 if the Orc survived his close contact with the Wargs, living with and feeding them as they did \u2014 the Warg-rider's armor would go from foul-smelling to rotten, and so would need to be constantly repaired and replaced.\n\nFresh hide would be stitched on top of old, and bones would be replaced as they disintegrated. Other parts of the orc's body would be wrapped in hide that had been reinforced with bone, and adorned with Warg fangs and spikes made from sharpened bone, to protect it from both enemy and ally.\n\nTheir armor may have been further strengthened by bonding pieces together with glue made by boiling down horse bones and hooves. Some orcs wore helmets made from the skulls and scalps of their kills, both beasts and men, and these often featured grisly crests of bone. A rough cloak of Warg fur would have completed the outfit.\n\nThe jockeys carried no shield, as both hands would be needed to hold on to the sword he carried and to the Warg itself.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Warg_riders"}}

Besides the shaping of Arda, Aulë's greatest works were the Two Lamps of the Valar, the vessels of the Sun and Moon, and the Dwarves, whom he created out of impatience for the Children of Ilúvatar.

Both also came to create beings of their own. But while Aulë strove to be true to the original intent of the Music of the Ainur, and submitted all that he did to the will of Ilúvatar, Melkor wished to control and subvert all things, and was jealous of the creations of others so that he would try to twist or destroy all that they made. There was long strife between Aulë and Melkor both before and after the creation of Arda. Aulë, however, traditionally opposed attempts to fight Melkor, for fear of the damage that would be wrought to Arda.\n\nWhen the Elves came to Valinor, the Ñoldor became the students of Aulë. Fëanor was his greatest pupil, and from him learned to make gems through craftsmanship that is now forgotten. This would eventually lead to the Silmarils, the greatest creation of handiwork within Arda. On the Flight of the Noldor, the Noldor who returned to Valinor under Finarfin named themselves the Aulendur, Followers of Aulë. Despite his lordly skill, Aulë was humble and compassionate, and indeed the Dwarves survived only because Aulë submitted them to the will of Ilúvatar. His spouse was Yavanna, with whom he dwelt in central Valinor.\n\nDesperate for pupils onto whom he could pass his knowledge, and unwilling to wait for the emergence of the Children of Ilúvatar, Aulë created his own race of beings, the dwarves. However, he did not have a clear idea of what the Children of Ilúvatar would be like, and because of the presence of the chaos caused by Melkor, Aulë made the Dwarves strong and unyielding, and not willing to endure the domination of others, as well as embodying some of his values and desires for Middle-earth. However Aulë did not have the power to give independent life to his creations, they could act only when his thought was on them.\n\nWhen Aulë completed his work he began to instruct the Dwarves in a language he had made for them, Khuzdul. Then Ilúvatar spoke to Aulë, asking why he would seek to exceed his power and authority by attempting to make new life. Aulë repented, answering that the drive to create was kindled in him by Ilúvatar, and that he only wished for other beings to love and teach, with whom to share in the beauty of the world. He admitted that his impatience had driven him to folly and submitted his creations to Ilúvatar. Assuming that they should be destroyed, he made to smite the seven Fathers of the Dwarves with a great hammer.  As he raised the hammer the Dwarves shrank from the coming blow, but Ilúvatar stayed Aulë's hand and showed that he had accepted Aulë's offer by gifting the Dwarves with spirits of their own, else they could not have been afraid.\n\nIlúvatar accepted the Dwarves as his adopted children however, as it was ordained that the elves were to be the first-born race, Ilúvatar set the Dwarves to sleep until after the Awakening of the Elves. He told Aulë that while both were his children, their creation was outside the scope of the Music of the Ainur, and strife would arise between the Dwarven race and the Elven race as the events of the world unfolded. The Dwarves believe that after they die their spirits move to halls that Aulë has set aside for them alone, and that their role will be to rebuild Arda after the Final Battle.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Aul%C3%AB"}}

He became King at the age of fifty when his father Gram died in TA 2741 during a time of crisis. His father had fought open warfare with the Dunlendings, who operated from the captured fortress of Isengard.\n\nDuring his reign, King Helm came into conflict with an arrogant, wealthy, and powerful landowner named Freca. Freca was a Dunlending with Rohirric blood; he claimed to be a descendant of King Fréawine of Rohan. Freca held lands - both banks of the river Adorn and his stronghold was near its source on the borders of Rohan. Freca viewed King Helm with both contempt and scorn, while Helm mistrusted Freca and was wary of him.\n\nIn TA 2754, Freca attempted to intimidate and coerce King Helm into giving his approval and consent to an arranged marriage between Freca's son Wulf and Helm's daughter. Freca marched to a meeting of the King's council in Edoras with a great force of men, planning to threaten the King into complying with his demands. In the resulting quarrel, Helm Hammerhand smote Freca with single blow from his fist. The blow was so great Freca died soon after. Enraged, the men of Freca left Edoras, and King Helm declared Wulf and his kin enemies of the King.\n\nFour years later in TA 2758, a combined force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf, and the Corsairs of Umbar overran Rohan. Helm was defeated in battle at the Crossings of Isen, and Helm withdrew into the Hornburg at Helm's Deep (which was later renamed in his honor). There, he endured a long siege.\n\nWhile King Helm and his younger son Prince Háma were besieged in the Hornburg, a force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf also besieged Edoras. Prince Haleth, King Helm\u2019s elder son who was the last defender to fall, led the defence of Edoras. He fell defending the doors of the Golden Hall.\n\nBoth Prince Háma and King Helm died during the Siege of the Hornburg. Shortly after Yule 2758, Prince Háma accompanied by a small force attempted a forage mission, but he and his men were lost in a blizzard and never seen again. The Hornburg held a large war-horn, and whenever it was blown, Helm would break through the Dunlending ranks, slaying many of their men. It is believed that many of the men he killed he did so with his bare hands.\n\nIt was said that grief and hunger made Helm more ferocious. After one such sortie, Helm died and did not return; his body was discovered the next morning frozen in the snow still standing, his eyes open, ready to fight. This led to a belief among the Rohirrim and Dunlendings that even in death the wraith of Helm Hammerhand still wandered through Rohan, and defended the Hornburg. Helm died in TA 2759 at the age of sixty-eight. Prince Haleth and Prince Háma also died during the conflict; his nephew Fréaláf Hildeson, who defeated the Dunlendings, succeeded Helm.\n\nHelm was called Hammerhand because of his grim nature, great strength and prowess; he also was known to fight barehanded sometimes attributed to a superstition that if \"he used no weapon no weapon would upon bite him\". The statue of Hammerhand was erected in Helm's Deep's courtyard.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Helm_Hammerhand"}}

In Unfinished Tales, Tolkien writes that on the 20th of September in 3018 Gríma was captured by the Nazgûl in the fields of Rohan, while on his way to Isengard to inform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at Edoras. He was interrogated and divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazgûl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Previously, the location of the Shire had been unknown to the Nazgûl, but they knew it to be the home of 'Baggins', whom they thought still had the Ring.","In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film of The Lord of the Rings, Gríma Wormtongue was voiced by Michael Deacon (and his name is pronounced as \"Gree-ma\"). Here he is much smaller than is implied in the book.

According to Dourif, Jackson encouraged him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience would immediately have a subliminal reaction of unease to the character. ","Gríma appears in The Lord of the Rings Online, and in the Battle for Middle-earth games as a hero for the Isengard faction, also Lord of the Rings Conquest."],"name":"Gríma Wormtongue","description":"Little is known of Gríma before he became counselor of Théoden in Edoras. His childhood is a mystery. What is known is that Gríma, son of Gálmód, and a native of Rohan, joined the service of Saruman in secret and worked as a spy to weaken Théoden and his kingdom, using his voice to keep the spell intact while Saruman is inside the King.\n\nIt is likely that Saruman had promised him Éowyn, the king's niece, as a reward for his services; in the novel, Wormtongue is accused of \"watching her under his lids and haunting her steps\" and in the film, he makes clumsy romantic overtures to her as she weeps for her dead cousin Théodred. He also exiles Éowyn's brother Éomer and his army from Rohan, only saying that he sees \"too much\" after Éomer says, \"Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps\". It is also possible that he has Dunlending ancestry, since he is darker-haired and physically smaller than the other Rohirrim.\n\nAfter Gandalf usurps Gríma's control of Théoden and releases the King, \"many things which men had missed\" were found locked in his trunk, including Herugrim, the blade of Théoden. With his betrayal revealed, Théoden presents Gríma with a choice: either ride into battle for the King or be exiled. Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Saruman at Orthanc. In the book, Gríma arrived at Orthanc after the battle of the Ents, but in the movie, he was there before the battle began. There, Gríma gave Saruman important information about Théoden's plans to leave Edoras with his people suspecting an attack would come, and that they would flee to Helm's Deep, the main fortress of Rohan, where the Battle of the Hornburg would be fought. Later, Saruman had cause to regret Gríma's dwelling in Orthanc when, following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, he foolishly threw a \"heavy rock\"\u2014 which was actually the Palantír of Orthanc at either Gandalf or Saruman (it is stated that \"he couldn't decide which he hated most\"), an act for which Saruman seems to have punished him severely (Pippin picked up the Palantír). Saruman was also said to have scalped Gríma and beaten him over time.\n\nGríma then accompanied Saruman to the Shire, where the two sought revenge in petty tyranny over the hobbits (though Saruman had already been exerting control from afar by sending evil Men to the Shire). During this time, Gríma became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, a beggar, almost resembling Gollum, and Saruman shortened his nickname to \"Worm\". Gríma killed Lotho Sackville-Baggins and may have eaten him, which he claims to have done in the book under Saruman's orders.\n\nSpurred by the words of Frodo that he did not have to follow Saruman, and having been pushed over the edge when Saruman scorned him, Gríma used a hidden knife to slit Saruman's throat, killing him (only in the book). He then tried to make his escape, but was quickly killed by several arrows fired from the hobbits present, ending his short and unhappy life.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue"}}

Soon, Morgomir and the Barrow-wights trapped him in the royal barrow.\n\nCarthaen's body was destroyed when Morgomir stabbed him with his Morgul-blade, but his spirit was corrupted, and he was transformed into one of the deadliest servants of the Witch-king: Karsh the Whisperer. Karsh became Leader of the Great Plague and went around seeking victims across Arnor. He hunted the Witch-king's enemies, whose screams were rarely heard, due to his deadly swift attacks, which could transform his prey into wraiths themselves.\n\nAfter the fall of Fornost, and the triumph of the Witch-King, Karsh was the first to attack the Elves and killed many Hobbits and Dúnedain. When Glorfindel and Eärnur attacked Angmar, the forces of the Elves and Gondor were too much for him and Elrond of Rivendell killed him by his magic Noldor sword. The spirit of Carthaen went to the Halls of Mandos and Karsh's body destroyed. The soul of the brave Arnorian Captain at last became free.\n\nCaptain Carthaen is a non-canonical character and appears only in the video game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king.\n\nKarsh's abilities makes him a counter for any hit and run tactics, as two of his abilities make getting away from him rather difficult. His first ability Chill Soul reduces the movement speed of any hostile units around him by 50% and deals damage over time. His next ability Blink allows him to teleport to a given location, allowing him to immediately teleport on top of a target and apply Chill Soul to force the opposition to deal with him, the teleport also acted the same way as Rogash's leap in that it scattered units and deal damage. His third and final ability Whisper of Death deals extreme damage to any living target, but is useless against any undead units. Just like normal Wraith's he gains health for every time he hits an enemy or a structure, which can make him a good meat shield against cheap units.\n\nKarsh was voiced by the English actor Jason Connery.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Karsh"}}

During the battle of Erebor, these giant beasts devastated dozens of soldiers with one strike alone of their weapons.\n\n(Weapons)\n\nBeing Ologs, these trolls were quite intelligent and kept formation with the orcs as they marched to battle. The war trolls carried a variety of weapons into battle against the allied armies of dwarves, elves, and men. Some trolls carried huge scythed gauntlets fitted with huge and sharp blades. (similar to the Guldur Orcs' shields). Others carried steel war maces and huge wooden clubs fitted with iron spikes in order to smash men and elf alike into paste. Some even used their bare hands, balling them up into fists to smash the allied armies, a few just simply grabbed the allied soldiers and threw them across the battlefield.\n\n(Stumpy\" the Albino Troll)\n\nThe least fortunate of these giant trolls was dubbed \"Stumpy,\" by the producers. He was Albino, Truncated at the limbs, (chained flails replaced his arms, while wrecking ball-like maces were in place of his legs. Stumpy was born blind and eyeless, and had chains fixed from his eye sockets to a chair on his back that was controlled by an orc driver. During the film \"The battle of the five armies: the extended edition\" the large albino troll was seen smashing through both elf and dwarf lines, until he was hijacked by Bofur, and was made to fight against other trolls and orcs (unwillingly) on the way to Ravenhill and was ultimately killed by Legolas.\n\n(Troll strengths)\n\nUnlike the smaller Guldur Olog-Hai, these trolls couldn't simply be taken down by a spear throw to the neck or a few arrows. It would take dozens of arrows and several spears\/pikes to be sent into the unarmored parts of the troll in order to take it down. A premeditated attack upon a troll would usually work and needed to be planned out well in order to kill the creature.\n\n(Other varieties of great Ologs)\n\nOther than being huge shock troops during the great battle of Erebor, certain varieties and sub-species of great Ologs were used to Azog's advantages, by being given siege machinery (such as ladders or battering ram-like stone headpieces.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Five Armies (Extended Edition only), a war troll was commandeered by Bofur, using the chains connected to its eye sockets to move it around. He used it to fight against the Guldur Orcs, until the other dwarves procured a dwarven battle cart and used it to smash through the army to get to Azog. Bofur followed them with his war troll until another war troll came across the other dwarves. Bofur controled his war troll to fight another war troll. The weight of the other war troll causes it to sink into the ice. Bofur and his troll begin to sink as well, until Bofur kills the other war troll using the one he is currently controlling. Bofur abandons his war troll and goes with the others, while the war troll wanders off aimlessly, smashing into things. It eventually comes across Legolas, who is shooting on top of a tower. The troll begins smashing the tower, until Legolas drops onto its head, sword in hand, mortally wounding it. The creature then smashes into the tower head-on, falling over the edge into a chasm below, killing it.\n\nIn the concept art book (Chronicles: the battle of the five armies edition) the concept art for these war trolls was going to originally have many of them with huge horns and spiny protrusions coming from their backs. An unusued troll concept was the \"Caber Troll\" which was going to be a type of horned troll that would throw giant Cabers (logs\/trees) adorned with spikes and hammers into the allied army lines.

This one-time Captain of the Black Númenóreans is the Witch-king\u2019s left hand man and rules over the corrupted and evil Men of Angmar \"with an iron fist\"."],"name":"Morgomir","description":"In the time of the first defeat of Sauron, his minions were scattered, demoralized, and leaderless. A minority of Orcs were eventually recruited by the Nazgûl. It was in this dark time for the forces of evil that the leader of the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, named his first in command in the Nazgûl as Morgomir and moved his forces upon the Edain-kingdom of Arnor in war.\n\nIt was Morgomir who acted as the Witch-king's chief Military-strategist, pointing out Arnor as being weaker than the kingdom of Gondor. He also commanded many of the deciding battles of the war. Morgomir's fighting technique is derived from the ancient Kings of Númenor - in battle he would usually deliver his strikes in a downward swing, or several twirling upward ones. He was more common to finish of leaders with a straight lunge into the chest. This battle technique was only used by Morgomir in the Angmar War, during which the power of the Witch-king allowed him to permanently take his visible, \"twilight\" form.\n\nWhen the Witch-king's forces began their assault on Arnor, there was only Morgomir and the Dread Lord himself. They arrived in the frozen mountain range just north of Arnor in the winter of that year. It was here that Morgomir pointed out a valuable unit, the Troll of the North Rogash, a viciously intelligent troll with the skill to wield a giant blade. Morgomir advised the Witch-king to coerce with the troll, and just as he had predicted, the troll and his legions of snow and hill trolls bowed to what was soon named The Iron Crown.\n\nWhen the Witch-king's stronghold in Angmar fell under attack by the native Black Númenóreans, the new troll army crushed them and the Witch-king gave them a choice, either their wills or their lives would be forfeit. When they agreed to serve, the Witch-king rewarded Morgomir by naming him Commander of the Black Númenóreans.\n\nWhen Morgomir made links inside the Hill-men of Rhudaur, his chief conspirator, Hwaldar the Hill Chief, was arrested by the forces of Arnor. Morgomir convinced the Witch-king that he was valuable, so the Witch-king launched a deadly assault on Rhudaur to free the hill-chief. It was Morgomir who cut down the royal guards and freed Hwaldar with a single stroke, again proving his worth as the Witch-king's Right-Hand-Man. This act earned the hill chief's respect and allegiance but landed Angmar in a very bad situation, for their attack force was dwindling and Arnor's fortresses to the east had been deployed, marching in their direction. And so, he turned again to Morgomir.\n\nMorgomir trained a select group of Black Númenóreans to develop their dark-art skills. These warriors, called \"thrall masters\", developed the ability to summon armies from the dust and before too long, the Witch-king's army was replenished and a bloody battle ensued. With the fall of the two fortresses and the death of King Argeleb, the first in command of Arnor's royal house, Arnor abandoned the first kingdom and prepared for the Witch-king's assault on the second: Cardolan and the ancient burial grounds of Arnor.\n\nAfter the Witch King´s victory in Rhudaur the only invasion route to Arthedain was through the Weather Hills guarded by the watchtower of Amon Sûl. After many years of attacking the fortress the Witch King himself with all of his lieutenants attacked the great fortress. Here a heavy strategy was needed for king Arveleg could foresee all their strategies with the Palantír of Amon Sûl. After an initial attack in the fortress they got inside and Morgomir showed a new spell in his deadly arsenal a power to reduce even the strongest tower to the ground, using it only in the main tower ruining it. But before the tower fell the King Arveleg with his personal guard managed to escape with the greatest desire of the Witch-king, the Palantír of Amon Sûl.\n\nEven if the Witch-king had destroyed Amon Sûl, he was still disappointed by the escape of Arveleg with the Palantír. The Witch-king decided to send Morgomir to hunt the king as a reward for his deeds in the Fall of Amon Sûl. Morgomir divided his legions in two; one would be of Orcs mounted in Dire Wolves commanded by two thrall masters to hunt king Arveleg and the other commanded by Morgomir himself to follow the others closely. The raiding party meets the king and his guard in the North Downs.\n\nMorgomir arrived to the place some hours latter but found no sign of the king or the orcs. After searching in the zone they found a crater with a small piece of glass stocked firmly to the ground. A group of Arnor soldiers arrived and a short but bloody battle emerged in which the men of Angmar emerged victorious. After taking the object Morgomir knew that it was a piece of the Palantír and searched desperately for the rest of the Palantir. After finding most of the seven pieces Morgomir discovered that the total of craters was seven so he led an attack against the outpost of Arnor to get back the remaining pieces. After the outpost was destroyed Morgomir took the shards to his master personally and with the powers of the shards they were able to train a elite group of Black Númenóreans into sorcerers which used the power of souls from their acolytes to launch deadly spells.\n\nAfter the fall of Amon Sûl the men of Cardolan were not affected by Angmar so the Witch King needed to destroy them quickly and easily and Morgomir knew the perfect way in the perfect place, the Barrow Downs. Morogmir knew that the desecration of these ancient soils would demoralize and anger the men of Arnor, pushing them into a hasty attack that would destroy them. The strategy consisted in sending small portions of the main army until the Prince of Cardolan came himself and then the main army would attack.\n\nMorgomir arrived during the mid battle to challenge the vanguard of Cardolan holding them until the arrive of the Witch King. Morgomir´s skills where very handy against the elite soldiers of Arnor. When the prince arrived Morgomir managed to maintain his troops aligned until the Witch King arrived for they feared more Morgomir than the armies of Arnor. The Witch King arrived and killed the prince and his army leaving Cardolan vulnerable for attack. Cardolan was destroyed completely few days after the battle. Angmar´s power was unstoppable at that time.?\n\nDuring the battle at Carn Dûm, the Witch-king became weakened in his powers, so he commanded Morgomir to take his army of newly trained sorcerers to lead an attack on the burial grounds of Arnor, soon to be named the Barrow-downs. The Witch-king had a great idea, using the new sorcerers, he commanded Morgomir to have the barrow tombs corrupted with a dark plague, that would kindle the spirits of the fallen Kings of Arnor in an ancient Necromancy Ritual, thus creating the Barrow-wights. This was the great plague that would spread so far as to weaken even distant Gondor.\n\nMorgomir's forces arrived at the barrow downs later that evening, and with darkness growing in the East as Sauron regained his strength, Morgomir decided that all the Barrows had to be corrupted by sunrise to give their master enough energy to prepare for his return. When the armies and Captain of Cardolan discovered the activity in their burial grounds, they launched a massive counterattack that Morgomir had planned for. In a Black Ritual he performed himself sacrificing five Avatars, he called upon a monstrous spiritual wolf that arose from the depths of the earth and wrecked the army just as the rituals were completed. Out of every Barrow, arose twisted spirits that resembled Shades but had more of a form to them. The ghostly Barrow Wights.\n\nIt was in this moment, with the Dread Lord's victory over Cardolan, Captain Carthaen of Cardolan was cornered by Barrow Wights and forced against the doors of a corrupted barrow. Out of the shadows, Morgomir strode towards him. The conversation between the two, occurred like this;\n\nMorgomir let out a shrill laugh and drew the Morgul blade, as he stabbed the captain, the valiant warrior began to twitch. His spirit waned and his strength failed him as he assumed the form of one of the Witch-king's deadliest servants, the \"Whispering Wraith\" Karsh.\n\nMore than four hundred years have passed since Morgomir's last battle, but he is still as able as he was. Instead, his skills have improved with the Darkness which was falling over Arnor, and at last its arms reached Arnor\u2019s capital, Fornost, the last hope of the North was the only thing that stood between the Witch King and total domination of Arnor. The battle was long an if it wasn\u2019t for Angmar's commanders certainly they would not stood a chance but their commanders presence specially that of the two Nazgûl was enough to make even the wildest troll have the organization equal to that of the men of Arnor. Morgomir's ruining skill was very handy during this battle. Before twilight Fornost was taken the Witch King sat upon the throne of Arnor and none dared to defy his power.\n\nAfter the destruction of Fornost and the final eradication of Arnor, the Witch-king sat on the throne of Angmar, Morgomir at his side. And with Sauron's strength almost fully restored, the Dread Lord could see everything and hear everything. And what he heard amused him, the last leader of Arnor had fled to Rivendell, to the Council of Elrond. Men called for their last known leader to join the elves in a final struggle against the Witch-king. The elves called for Glorfindel and Elrond to lead the army in the final battle, so the army moved on the Witch-king and forced him out of Fornost. Before the Dread Lord knew it, he was retreating into Angmar's frozen hills to his last stronghold, with the final battle now before him.\n\nMorgomir lead a strike force of Black Númenóreans to meet Elrond, Glorfindel and the prince Eärnur of Gondor. Karsh followed behind with barrow wights and sorcerers, whilst Rogash waited in ambush with his army of trolls. When Morgomir's troops met the alliance's, there was a vicious confrontation. The second in command of Angmar and the Nazgûl, dueled all three leaders at the same time, his skills pushed the prince to the ground and he drew a morgul blade. Glorfindel crippled Morgomir by slashing his middle three fingers off and sent the blade to the ground. Morgomir kept fighting, but the overwhelming might of Elrond and Glorfindel pushed him to his limits. His army was destroyed, and he fled from Angmar into Mordor where he and the Witch-king were reunited with the rest of the Nazgûl.\n\nThe Witch-king lost at the battle of the frozen plains and he retreated back to Mordor, where he was reunited with Morgomir's damaged spirit; he had returned to wraith form and had lost most of his acquired powers. He was just like the rest of the nine.\n\nAfter returning to Mordor, the powers that allowed Morgomir to keep a physical shape disappeared along with part of his strength, but still he was a dangerous foe. He participated in the taking of Minas Ithil and was one of the six Nazgûl that dwelt there with the Witch-king. He was swept by the flood in the river Bruinen and lost his horse there, as did the others. He then returned to Mordor where he received a new steed (a Fell Beast) and he, Sauron and the other Nazgûl then planned the Great Siege of Minas Tirith.\n\nClarification: Once Sauron returned to Mordor, with seven Nazgûl waiting for him, Khamul became his the Witch-king's \"second\". Since Khamul is known to be from the land of Rhûn, Morgomir was different from him.\n\nMorgomir was destroyed by lava-storm with the rest of the Nine after the One Ring was finally cast away into the Crack of Doom.\n\nAccording to the non-canonical Mordor: The Land of Shadow story-lines, Morgomir would have become the wraith Adunaphel, seeing as how he was from Númenor, and Khamûl is already confirmed to be the Witch-king's second; however, Adunaphel is named as the only female Ringwraith, which makes this knowledge more than a bit conflicting. Given how unlikely it is that any of the Nine were female, most fans are agreeable, though, with the identity of Morgomir being given to the 7th King of Men and the 3rd and last of the trio of former Black Numenoreans to fall under the thraldom of the Great Rings.\n\nMorgomir is a mid-game to end-game oriented hero unit that could be considered a tactical leader. He starts with no abilities, but gains the Morgul Blade for single target damage which turns the enemy into a Wraith if they are killed while the debuff is active. His Dread Visage reduces the attack and defense of any hostile units within the area. He also has two damage spike abilities: Dark Glory increases the damage and armor of Thrall Masters, Black Númenóreans, and Dark Rangers by a considerable amount and his last abilities is Ruin, a very high damaging single target skill that can only be used against structures. \n\nAs the mid to end-game leader Hero, he is rather weak in a one on one fight against other heroes and cannot take down more than a few weak battalions. Concentrated fire will bring him down rather quickly, but he is more robust then Hwaldar is. His debuff ability makes him worthwhile to use alongside Hwaldar and the Hill-men, as it evens the playing field further against higher quality units.\n\nSee also Morgomir at The Wiki for Middle-earth for game-information.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Morgomir"}}

He was the son and fourth child of Anárion, and was recorded as being the last child born in Númenor before its downfall. He had three older siblings, apparently all sisters.\n\nAfter the War of the Last Alliance in which his father Anárion was slain, for a few years Meneldil was groomed by his uncle Isildur to rule Gondor, since Isildur and his sons intended to go to the North to rule Arnor. According to Unfinished Tales, Meneldil was farsighted and well-pleased at the planned departure of Isildur, hoping that affairs in the North would keep them occupied. Meneldil became the third King of Gondor in TA 2 after the death of his uncle Isildur in the Disaster at the Gladden Fields. Meneldil was the first King of Gondor who ruled independently from the High Kingdom of the Dúnedain, Arnor.\n\nIt is uncertain whether Meneldil was King by right, as his father was only the regent for Gondor under the High King Isildur. His young cousin Valandil would have had the better claim as High King of Gondor and Arnor, but no claim by Valandil was ever made. It was in any case unlikely that Meneldil would give up his right to rule to a much younger cousin he had never seen. In any case, the people of Gondor did not resist Meneldil's claim to the throne, and King Valandil and his heirs made no serious attempt to regain control over Gondor until after Anárion's line had failed. In effect, Meneldil thus severed Gondor from Arnor, but the title of High King remained with the northern line.\n\nMeneldil died in TA 158 after one hundred fifty six years of rule and two hundred eighty one years of life and was succeeded by his son Cemendur.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Meneldil"}}

He was the eldest child of Denethor II (the penultimate Steward of Gondor) and his wife Finduilas, and would have taken over as Steward after Denethor's death, had he lived. When Boromir was only ten-years old, his mother died. Consequently, his father became a grim person and visibly preferred Boromir over his brother, Faramir. Despite this fact, Boromir looked after his younger brother and they became very close. Boromir devoted himself to leading his people and fought in the battle for the eastern part of Osgiliath. He, his brother, and two others were the only survivors of the unit that held the bridge until its destruction; they had to swim the river Anduin to reach safety.","Boromir disliked the idea of destroying the One Ring, as he believed that it could be used to defeat Sauron once and for all, to save Gondor, and return it to its former glory; he tried to convince Frodo to give him the Ring. When Frodo refused, Boromir tried to take it by force but the hobbit put it on and fled.","Three days after Boromir's death, his brother Faramir saw his funeral boat passing down the Anduin. Men of Gondor found Boromir's horn, the Horn of Gondor, broken in twain, and brought it to his father. This drove Denethor to despair, and when compounded with Faramir's later seemingly-mortal wounding and his knowledge of Mordor's indomitable might, he lost his mind. Many, including Faramir, often lamented Boromir's passing as Sauron readied his forces to attack, noting that his loss would be keenly felt by Gondor on the field of battle.","Boromir is portrayed by the English actor Sean Bean in Peter Jackson's trilogy as a brave and skilled warrior whose loyalty to Gondor tempts him to take the Ring for himself. He first appears in The Fellowship of the Ring at the Council of Elrond, where he suggests that Gondor use the One Ring as a weapon against Sauron. Although he squabbles with Aragorn over the kingship of Gondor, he joins the Fellowship of the Ring when it assembles. As the Fellowship travels toward Lórien, Boromir proves his worth as a fighter but continues to be tempted by the Ring. When the group arrives at Caras Galadhon, Galadriel speaks to him telepathically of the fall of Gondor.","Boromir's sword was like its owner: big, broad, and powerful. To use it single-handed required someone with great strength in the arm and wrist, both of which this skilled warrior had in abundance. It is a hand and a half sword meaning Boromir could wield it with one hand allowing him to use his shield and as a two handed sword. The blade was over three inches across at its widest point; it had a flattened diamond shape in section with an equally wide fuller in order to keep the weight down. However, the fuller ended some way short if the tip, thereby keeping as much strength in the end of the blade as possible. It was sharpened on both edges and tapered actually at the tip, which meant that it would have been equally effective for slashing against lightly armoured opponents.","In Ralph Bakshi's film, Boromir was portrayed by the English voice actor Michael Graham Cox in which the character has on a helmet that resembles a stereotypical viking's with two horns on each side.","In the 1955 BBC play, he was portrayed by the British voice actor Derek Prentice.

It was said of him by Éomer that he had a great deal in common with the people of Rohan. However, his desire to protect his people, and his inability to do so, left him vulnerable to the predations of the One Ring. This eventually caused him to attempt to take it from Frodo, though he deeply regretted this almost immediately after it occurred.

Melkor was the first to learn of the Awakening. He soon began sending evil spirits among the Elves, who planted seeds of doubt against the Valar. It is also rumoured that some of the Men were being captured by a Rider if they strayed too far, and the Men later believed these were brought to Utumno, who cruelly tortured and twisted them into Orcs.\n\nIn the First Age, thousands of Orcs were bred in Angband by Morgoth and to participate in the Battles of Beleriand, which lasted 587 years. They first appeared in the Battle of Lhammoth, where they were defeated by the Noldor. When the House of Fëanor returned to Middle-earth Morgoth sent a force of Orcs against them. Although the Orcs outnumbered the exiles they were no match for the power and wrath of the Ñoldor, and were quickly and easily defeated. However, Fëanor could not defeat the power of Morgoth alone and he was killed, leaving the Orcs to continue to breed under the Dark Lord. Years later, when the House of Fingolfin arrived in Middle-earth, Orcs were sent against them as well, but they were utterly defeated in the Battle of the Lammoth.  After their crushing defeat in the Dagor Aglareb and in a minor raid on Hithlum, the Orcs nevertheless regained their numbers and fought again in large numbers in the Dagor Bragollach and Nirnaeth Arnoediad. They were nearly destroyed in the War of Wrath, and those that survived fled eastwards into the Mountains of Angmar and the Grey Mountains.\n\nSometime around SA 1000, Sauron reappeared in Middle-earth and made the land of Mordor his realm, and then started to build the foundations of Barad-Dûr. During the War of the Elves and Sauron in SA 1700, the Orcs formed the main host of Sauron's power. Despite the immeasurable number of Orcs present, the battle was won by the Elves and the Numenoreans due to their united force and numbers.\n\nIn Tolkien's writings, Orcs were evil, cruel, wicked, hateful, blackhearted, and hated everybody and everything, particularly the orderly and prosperous. Physically, they were short in stature (unless of the Uruk variety) and humanoid in shape. They were generally squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, bow-legged, with wide mouths and slant eyes, long arms, dark skin, and fangs. Tolkien describes one \"huge Orc chieftain\" as \"almost Man-high\", and some must have been close to Hobbit height, as Sam and Frodo are able to disguise themselves as Orcs in Mordor.\n\nOrcs made no beautiful things, but many clever ones including machines, tools, weapons, and instruments of torture, were delighted by wheels, engines, and explosions, and could tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled Dwarves. This was so since the day they were bred by Melkor from corrupted, tortured and mutilated Men. They hate themselves and have an even deeper hatred of the Dark Lord who has brought them to this end. The result is a violent and warlike race in a perpetual state of chaos with itself and others. Despite their abominable nature, they are not dim-witted and are clever and crafty and make good tools, weapons, and machines of war but produce no beautiful things nor do they trade or share anything with others, unless ordered to by a Dark Lord for the purposes of war and conquest. Their tools and weapons, however, are of poor quality when compared to those of the Free Peoples.\n\nThey also developed tunnel-making, for living underground away from the light. Wickedness and violence were their nature, and they were known to quarrel and kill each other over petty things. An example of this destructiveness was its effect on nature such as was the case with forests and trees, which were often destroyed to fuel their war-making. See: Fangorn forest during the War of the Ring and the western part of Middle-earth after Sauron's War on the Elves in the mid-Second Age. However, perhaps the best example of this was during the War of the Ring, when two different groups of Orc soldiers captured the Hobbit Frodo Baggins, and then killed each other to the last in the Tower of Cirith Ungol due to a quarrel over his belongings. This allowed Samwise Gamgee to rescue Frodo and ultimately caused the destruction of the One Ring. Orcs generally hated all Elves, Dwarves, and Men, and yet some were said to make alliances with wicked Dwarf groups and others with corrupted Men. Without the leadership of a Dark Lord, Orcs usually live in tribal communities in underground lairs under mountains under the rule of brutal chieftains, raiding and pillaging settlements of other races that are unfortunate enough to live near them. Thus, they were hated by almost every race that knows them, even those allied with them. Without firm leadership, Orcs presumably went into battle often in complete disarray and without any semblance of formation or tactics. Their strength in combat came from numbers and sheer violence. Due to superior organization, training and weaponry, Men, Dwarves, Elves, and at times even Hobbits, were able to defeat larger numbers of Orcs, provided an ability to withstand the horror and shock of the initial onslaught.\n\nIn Tolkien's Sindarin language, \"Orc\" is orch, plural yrch. In his late, post-Lord of the Rings writings (published in The Peoples of Middle-earth), he preferred the spelling \"Ork\", evidently mainly to avoid the form Orcish, which would be naturally pronounced with the c as \/s\/ instead of \/k\/. (In Tolkien's languages the letter c was always pronounced \/k\/.) It is also possible that the word is a Common Tongue Version of 'orch', the Sindarin word for Orc. The original sense of the word seems to be \"bogey\", \"bogeyman\", that is, something that provokes fear, as seen in the Quenya cognate urko, pl. urqui. In the old English Orc means \"demon.\" The term Uruk-hai merely means \"orc-folk\" in the Black Speech, and was the Uruk-hai's name for themselves.\n\n\"Gorgûn\" was the name that Ghân-buri-Ghân of the wild men of the Drúadan Forest used for the Orcs in their own language.\n\n\"Yrrch\" was the name used by Haldir and his brother, Elves of Lothlorien. This same variation on \"orc\" was also used by Legolas indicating that it is Sindarin.\n\nIn the Peter Jackson films, orcs range greatly in appearance. Skin colour ranges from bone white (Azog and Bolg) and peachy colours (orcs like Gothmog) to shades of green. Most Orcs however, are shown as having darker shades of black or brown skin. Some orcs are also much more human-like than others, Azog looks like a large and muscular but pale and hairless human whilst Gothmog looks much more deformed and less human-like. In general the Orcs tend to be shorter than most men. Early orcs shown are particularly slack with poor posture and broad with long arms (Grishnakh is a good example of this shape) but some later Orcs are a more human shape. Another variety of Orc appears in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. These orcs are short mutated creatures covered in dubious warts and unidentified growths. They have pallid pinkish-white skin, large heads, and bat-like or porcine facial features. Many of these orcs also had small amounts of thinning white hair, and cataracts on their sensitive eyes. Also notable is the size of these orcs: while some were easily as big as a man, others were so small they'd be hard pressed to reach a Hobbit's shoulder height.\n\nThe clothing and armour they wear also ranges greatly. The orcs seem to wear an assortment of different styles of armour and clothing and also commonly have various piercings and tribal scars. The clothing and armour was probably scavenged. Other Orcs wear specifically designed and made uniform armour for battle. Orcs are often bald or balding, but there are also Orcs who have longer matted hair. The Orcs' hair is nearly always dark or greying in colour, but in The Return of the King some orcs with blonde hair and beards can be seen marching from Minas Morgul. The favourite weapon of the Orcs is an Orc Scimitar, used by Orcs from all areas.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Orcs"}}

Their exact origin is debated, though it was clearly stated that they were created by Morgoth in some sense."],"name":"Dragons","description":"Dragons lived throughout the First, Second, and Third ages of Middle-earth and may have lived longer. They were originally bred by Morgoth during the first age to serve as gigantic shock troopers and mobile artillery. The first dragon ever seen in Middle-earth was Glaurung, the father of dragons, who Morgoth used to great effect during the fourth and fifth battles in the War of the Jewels. Like most of the creatures made or twisted by Morgoth, they were capable of reproducing naturally. Dragons were sometimes referred to as serpents, great Worms, or simply Drakes, with the first two specifying the Wingless Dragons.\n\nDuring the First Age, the greatest heirloom of the house of Hador was the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, which was a helm of great weight that had as its crest an image of the head of Glaurung the Dragon.\n\nThe dragons of the Second Age and Third Age were a blight upon the Dwarves and all those who hoarded treasure. Some, like Smaug the Golden and Scatha the Worm, went from the Withered Heath and invaded Dwarven kingdoms. Before the coming of Smaug, there had not been notable activities observed during the Second Age, but dragons seemingly kept serving as dark servants (partially at least).\n\nThere was an inn in The Shire called The Green Dragon, and a type of flower and firework called a Snap Dragon. For Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday, Gandalf made a special dragon firework.\n\nIt is presumed that, after the death of Smaug in the Third Age, the great dragons had become extinct. According to Gandalf, the fire-drake race survived until at least just before the War of the Ring, and some lesser kin survived even after the war. It may have been possible that some races of dragon still existed throughout the Fourth Age.\n\nThe taxonomic system for Dragons in Middle-earth is based on two factors: means of locomotion, and fire breathing.\n\nSome Dragons could not breathe fire and were known as Cold-drakes. Of these most could not breathe anything at all, but some few could breathe a smoke or vapor or mist. In particular many Dragons without legs or wings were Cold-drakes. Cold-drakes are not referred to until the Third Age, though that does not mean they did not exist before. Possibly some Dragons, or perhaps some of their descendants, lost the ability to breathe fire in the millennium after the War of Wrath.\n\nDragons were long-lived, powerful, cunning, possessed of subtle intelligence, had great physical strength, and were covered in nearly impenetrable scales everywhere except their undersides. They also posessed an overwhelming greed for treasure, especially gold, and were well known for sleeping on piles of stolen treasure. By their very nature, they relished not only the theft of beautiful things, but the act of dispossession itself; essentially, it was more satisfying for them to steal treasure from another rather than come upon unclaimed valuables. According to Thorin Oakenshield they had a very keen sense of the value of their hoard, but never themselves crafted so much as a brass ring. Dragons were prone to fits of anger, which could result in devastating effects upon the surrounding land and those living on it. The reasons behind their strong affinity for gold are unknown, but dragons often put a greater priority on possessing gold than on obtaining food, and they can survive not eating (and maybe drinking as well) for decades or perhaps centuries. This suggests that jewels may be primal sources of the great serpents' life forces (though they could also simply possess extremely slow metabolisms, similar to other reptiles but exaggerated).. Due to this fact, dragons of Arda may or may not be immortal in ideal conditions, though regardless they are known to live for very long periods of time. Not much is known about the life cycle of dragons, but it is known that Glaurung, the progenitor of the species, took three centuries to grow from infancy to adulthood, and that he was considered an \"adolescent\" after growing for around a century. If Glaurung's development mirrors that of other dragons, then it also takes a great deal of time for their scales to become hard, as Glaurung's could still be penetrated by arrows after a century of development.\n\nMany accounts of interaction between dragons and other beings makes mention of them speaking, using the Common Tongue. In conjunction with this, they also possessed a hypnotic power known as the \"dragon-spell\", by which weaker-willed beings could be put into a trance or bent to a dragon's will when the beast spoke. Even those of strong will could be subjected to this ability, especially if they were not prepared for it. Dragons could make even greater use of this ability through psychological manipulation, increasing the power of the spell by taunting a subject with knowledge of some inner conflict on the part of the subject. Glaurung, for instance, was not fully capable of bending Túrin to his will, but when the dragon began to taunt him with his own failings, Túrin became far more receptive to the dragon's suggestions. In addition, this dragon-spell seems to have had the ability to plant mistrust in the listener's mind. This power also extended to a dragon's treasure hoard, causing it to excite feelings of greed and animosity among others who would possess it. Feuds and battles frequently followed upon the death of a dragon; usually between the individual who slew the beast and the original owners (or their heirs) of its hoard, as well as an occasional ambitious third party. Some have speculated that this 'curse' played a part in Fram's death at the hands of the Dwarves after he had slain Scatha. The same could be said of the famous Battle of Five Armies upon the death of Smaug, though other external circumstances clearly played a significant role in causing that conflict.\n\nDragons evidently delighted in sowing discord and strife among others, and apparently had a love of riddles and puzzling talk, spending long hours trying to decipher it. Therefore, speaking in ambiguous riddles was the best way to converse with a dragon, as it was quite unwise to either tell the full truth or to directly refuse them. Bilbo Baggins used this knowledge to great effect during his confrontation with Smaug, entertaining him with vague doublespeak in order to keep him mentally occupied and relatively calm.\n\nDragons had an acute sense of smell. During his encounter with Smaug, Bilbo Baggins was informed in no uncertain terms by the dragon that knew that Bilbo was in the company of Dwarves due to the scent of a \"dwarf-ridden pony\" upon Bilbo. However, he was unable to determine what Bilbo was by scent, as he had never encountered a hobbit before. Furthermore, despite his invisibility, thanks to the One Ring, Smaug was aware of the Hobbit's presence by both his breath and the movement of the air he caused in the great hall. Dragons were known to be able to sleep with half an eye open, on the alert for intruders if they were suspicious. The hobbit, his senses perhaps heightened by wearing the ring, also reported seeing a pale ray of light emanating from Smaug's eye as he probed the chamber back and forth for the burglar.\n\nDragons had strong scales covering the majority of their bodies, which could resist most weapons, though young dragons had to grow into their natural armour. Mithril is said to have been as strong as dragon scales, though lighter in weight. The underbelly of a dragon was described as soft, slimy, and unarmored, and was often exploited as a point of vulnerability in combat. However, Smaug had lain so long on the heap of treasure in the deep of the Lonely Mountain that gems and coins had become encrusted in the slime, so that he was \"armored above and below with iron scales and hard gems\"; he was also said to have had scales there too making his underbelly harder to strike at than his back (though this protection was not complete, and ultimately resulted in him being killed). The Dwarves appear to have had some skill at fighting dragons, as seen when they held off Glaurung for a time in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. This was one of the few instances where the battle was not due to stolen gold. The age-old fight between dwarves and dragons was primarily a result of the dwarves placing great value on their hard-earned treasure, and the dragon's habit of stealing it. King Dain I and his son Fror of the Grey Mountains were both slain at the doors of their hall by a great cold-drake. Both races had a lust for beautiful metals and gems, and so, naturally, came into conflict, with the dragons generally prevailling.\n\nA great stench went before Glaurung, and his blood contained some sort of venom, though it is not known if all dragons had these two traits, although the Dwarves commented on the reek of Smaug that filled the Lonely Mountain's halls after the dragon's long stay there.\n\nDragon fire was hot enough to melt the Rings of Power. Indeed, four of the seven rings gifted to the Dwarves were consumed by dragon fire. However, it was said by Gandalf that no dragon's fire would be hot enough to melt the One Ring, not even that of Ancalagon the Black, the greatest dragon.\n\nWhen the company Iron Crown Enterprises gained the licensing rights for games made from Tolkien's books, they expanded the selection of named dragons considerably in both Middle-earth Role Playing and The Wizards, a trading card game set in Middle-earth. Also in the real-time strategy game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, based on Peter Jackson's film trilogy, there is a dragon named Drogoth.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, there are several types of creatures distantly related to dragons. There are giant salamanders, worms (long, quadrupedal serpents) and drakes (smaller, weaker, less intelligent forms of dragons.) There is also an undead dragon in the game, Thorog, resurrected by the forces of the Witch-king of Angmar to aid him in maintaining control over the Misty Mountains. Though not all dragons were mentioned by name in the official texts, names coming from sources other than Tolkien are said not to be \"canonical\".\n\nIn a later expansions of the game, Drogoth the Dragon Lord were featured in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, serving as a commander of goblin forces.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard, a raid of 12 or 24 players takes place in the lair of Draigoch, another dragon in the Misty Mountains, though much further south in Enedwaith. He, unlike Thorog, is alive, though similarly flies and breathes fire. Another blue-fire breathing individual was portrayed as an ultimate force of Isengard.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, players encounter the dragon Úrgost and must ally with him against Agandaûr.\n\nDrakes will appear as rather neutral characters in Middle-earth: Shadow of War.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dragons"}}

After his death, he was re-embodied by the Valar to act as an emissary.","Glorfindel was born in Tirion sometime during the Noontide of Valinor, and was descended from a house of princes. He followed the House of Fingolfin during the Flight of the Ñoldor, but he took no part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë.","Along with King Turgon, Glorfindel fought in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, holding the King's flanks as they retreated towards the Pass of Sirion.","Glorfindel joined Tuor in defending the Square, until Egalmoth arrived and Ecthelion was slain during his fight with Gothmog. When King Turgon was also slain, the Gondolindrim escaped through Idril's Secret Way, with Glorfindel holding the rear manfully and lost more of his followers there.","A thousand years later, in SA 1600, Manwë sent him back to Middle-earth as an emissary of the Valar and granted him powers nearly as strong as that of the Maiar's.","It is possible that Glorfindel remained for a time in Lindon along with the other noble Elves, such as Gil-galad, Círdan, and Elrond, a descendant of Tuor and Idril.","During the Battle of Fornost, Glorfindel was the major reason the evil Witch-King of Angmar was defeated. After the battle was over, and the Witch-King had fled, it was Glorfindel who predicted that no mortal man would ever destroy the Witch-king. This prediction would come true a thousand years later at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, when Éowyn of Rohan (a woman) and Meriadoc Brandybuck (a Hobbit) destroyed the Witch-King.","A thousand years later, Glorfindel was sent by Lord Elrond to search for Frodo and his companions. He pursued some of the Nazgûl and drew them away from the Ford of Bruinen. He then found and led the company for days stopping only briefly to let the Hobbits rest. When the Nazgul approached again, Glorfindel put Frodo on his white horse Asfaloth, and bade the horse take Frodo to Rivendell. Asfaloth out ran the black horses of the Nazgûl and managed to cross the Ford of Bruinen which lead to Rivendell. A severely weakened Frodo, conscious but delirious due to the wound he was carrying from the Morgul Blade, turned back to defy the Riders who pleaded for him to come with them. The Nazgul entered the shallow ford but were there un-horsed and swept away by a torrent of enchanted water which guarded the entrance to Imladris charged with the power of the Half-elven and indeed by Gandalf the Grey. He later led the injured Frodo and the rest of the company safely to Rivendell.","After the Ring's destruction, Glorfindel, along with Erestor and the sons of Elrond, witnessed the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen. His ultimate fate is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that he eventually sailed to Valinor with the rest of his kin.","Glorfindel was a very capable fighter, with great endurance; he fought for hours during the Fall of Gondolin and managed to face against a Balrog on his own.","His original name is said to have been Laurefindil, which is the Quenya for \"Golden-haired\", from laurë (\"golden\") and findilë (\"head of hair\").Glorfindel is simply the Sindarin translation of Laurefindil, from glaur (\"golden\") and fîn or find (\"lock of hair\").","Glorfindel was said to be descended from a house of princes and one of the noble elves in Gondolin. Due to his golden hair, he might be descended from a Ñoldorin-Vanyarin intermarriage, like Finrod and Galadriel. His loyalty and following Turgon also indicated that he could be one of Turgon's kin, despite Turgon and the House of Fingolfin having dark hair. In The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, it is suggested that Glorfindel is a member of the House of Finarfin.","In Tolkien's early drafts, there were two Glorfindels: a Glorfindel of Gondolin and a Glorfindel of Rivendell. These two were initially thought to be different individuals. While writing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien borrowed a name from one of the earlier elves. As the legendarium grew more diverse, however, Tolkien decided that an elf who had fought in many wars might be a good companion for Gandalf. He explained in The Last Writings that the Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell are one and the same:","Upon deciding Glorfindel's return to Middle-earth, Tolkien came up with three options: SA 1200 (during Annatar's appearance in Númenor), SA 1600 (the completion of Barad-dûr), or TA 1000 (with the five Istari). Although all were probable, Tolkien favoured the SA 1600 as Glorfindel's return.","Glorfindel was left out of Ralph Bakshi's version of the Lord of the Rings, with Legolas in place of him when Aragorn was supposed to meet him before the attack at the Ford of Bruinen.","In The Fellowship of the Ring, Glorfindel's role in guiding Frodo Baggins to Rivendell is filled by Arwen, though he does appear during the prologue when Sauron is defeated. In The Return of the King, Glorfindel is seen walking next to Arwen as she is having her vision of her son Eldarion during the journey to The Grey Havens. In his last appearance, he is seen at the crowning of King Elessar, behind Legolas and in front of Arwen. In all appearances in the movies he has no speaking lines.","He was included in the BBC's Lord of the Rings radio serial in 1981 and was voiced by John Webb.","With Drogoth defeated, the Blue Mountains are free and Sauron's hold is further lessened. However, Glorfindel and Gloin are astonished to learn that the Dwarves refuse to help them. They then make their way to the Grey Havens, hoping for a better reception from the Elves."],"name":"Glorfindel","description":"Glorfindel was known for his golden hair, which at some point, was described to be yellow. He was an elf of great bodily and spiritual structure, wisdom, and bravery. The Gondolindrim loved him dearly and wept upon witnessing his passing at Cirith Thoronath. He was a capable leader, as seen when he led his House during the Fall, and loyal to his King and brothers-in-arms. He was very courageous and mindful of the refugees as they escaped. He chose to protect all the escaping Gondolindrim (especially Tuor and Idril), though he \"would have defended them even had they been fugitives of any rank\". He displayed more of his power and courage when he faced against the Nine Riders to save Frodo, and when he participated in the Council of Elrond.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Glorfindel"}}

He gave the Witch-King 7000 Easterlings to invade Minas Tirith and fight off the Rohirrim with. He provided Sauron with defensive Cohorts of Easterlings to maintain unity between the Orcs and Uruk-hai, i.e. the post-Pelennor ambush at Cair Andros. He personally lead 200,000 infantry and a payload of artillery to finally crush the Dalish Empire of Brand, kill Brand, and slay any Erebor resident that dared to protect Dale. He failed to crush the Dwarven stronghold he was requested personally by Sauron to crush, for when he had heard that Sauron died, Amdûr withdrew from Erebor noticing his incremental technology unable to penetrate the Dwarven Craftsmanship of the mountain walls.\n\nThere is no Amdûr in the actual Lore, but it is possible to create Developed characters for adaptations using names in Adûnaic, Westron, or in an Ancient or Medieval West Asian language from our world; all without resorting to non-Tolkien lore.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Amd%C3%BBr"}}

After they were bred, Attack Trolls were trained in battle far more effectively than normal Trolls, and had more powerful weapons and armor to ensure their devastation and survival."],"name":"Attack Troll","description":"They acted as shock troops for Mordor's mighty army, obliterating many soldiers of Gondor as the rest of the Orcs moved into the city. They were about the same height as normal Trolls (12-17 feet), but with far more strength and power. Later, an Attack Troll was also seen attempting to break down the Gates to the Third Level of Minas Tirith before being slain by the Army of the Dead.\n\nIn video games, Attack Trolls are among the most powerful of all the forces of evil. They were dressed in plate armor and could obliterate entire battalions of soldiers before finally being slain. They are some of Mordor's most valuable troops, as they are used to devastate both men and buildings alike.\n\nIt is highly likely that Attack Trolls were armored Olog-hai, which gave them resistance to the sun and more overall power.\n\nMost Attack Trolls were either trained to use, or preferred to use spiked clubs in battle. These gigantic clubs were suitable for destroying many enemies at a time with one swing. They also used these clubs to damage gates and smash structures to pieces. With its club, an Attack Troll could easily obliterate enemy formations, striking terror into the hearts of its foes and throwing them into utter disarray. In most video games, Attack Trolls can destroy one or more non-hero warriors in one swing.\n\nWhile most Attack Trolls preferred to use clubs, some (mainly their captains) used two huge swords instead of clubs. While these swords do not have such a huge damage radius and could be parried (only strong heroes like Aragorn are seen to be capable of this), they dealt the greatest damage. Also, these swords reduced the chance of attacking in melee even more, rendering most melee weapons practically useless against them.\n\nAttack Trolls have very few weaknesses, as they are protected by armor all around and can sweep away enemies before they can be hit. One weakness is the war pike. Commonly, their armour is weak at the neck. While an Attack Troll can slay Pikemen easily, it will most likely fall if a pike is thrown at its neck and connects. The same can occur to its chest if the armor is broken. Also, siege machines like catapults can hurl stones at the Attack Trolls, knocking them down or breaking the armor. While it will most likely not slay them by itself, it opens up opportunities for enemy soldiers to finish the job. Arrows can also slay Attack Trolls, though it will probably take one or more full volleys, as one arrow will certainly not be enough to slay them. Attack Trolls also became present in The Lord of the Rings: Conquest, in which the player can climb up the back of the troll, and stab it in the neck.\n\nUnlike Cave-trolls and other troll types, Attack Trolls were intelligent to an extent and were smart enough to strike only their opponents rather than every friend or foe in its path. Also, they had a finer battle style in general, working in groups to crush their enemies and knowing how to defeat them depending on their position. Attack Trolls also appear to cooperate well with Orcs rather than having to be enslaved by them, and could operate the siege machinery of Mordor (including Grond) well.\n\nAttack Trolls appear only in The Lord of the Rings videos games.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, they appear as the most feared and expensive heavy unit available to the faction of Mordor. They are extremely strong but have a weakness to spearmen.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Attack_Troll"}}

Its pinions were in between horned fingers; and its body gave off a stench. It is possible that fell beasts came from \"an older world\". The dark lord Sauron bred these fell beasts and gave them to his servants.\n\nWhen the Nine Nazgûl were thwarted at the Ford of Bruinen near Rivendell, they were riding coal-black horses. Those steeds were destroyed in the flood caused by Elrond's intercession that vanquished the Nazgûl as they pursued Frodo.\n\nAfter The Fellowship of the Ring had left Lothlórien and were camped on the western shore of the River Anduin, they saw \"a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night.\" When Legolas raised the great bow of Lórien and shot it with an arrow, it gave \"a harsh croaking scream\" and vanished into the gloom of the Eastern shore.\n\nFrodo, Sam, and Gollum encountered a fell beast while passing through the Dead Marshes, wherein Gollum referred to the beasts as \"wraiths on wings\".\n\nAccording to the chieftain of Harrowdale, a fell beast flew over Edoras and stooped just over Meduseld. They described it as being a darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird. After this, Gandalf told the Rohirrim to assemble at Dunharrow rather than at the fields to prevent attack.\n\nWhen Faramir, captain of Gondor, was fleeing from the besieged city of Osgiliath on his way to Minas Tirith, he was many times beset by winged Nazgûl until Gandalf rode out and drove them away with a shaft of white light from his raised hand, most probably from Narya, the invisible ring of fire, of which he was the bearer.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Witch-king of Angmar arrived in battle mounted on a fell beast. When the Witch-king successfully injured King Théoden, Éowyn removes her guise as Dernhelm and kills the fell beast. The winged Wraiths would later join the Battle of the Black Gate and be engaged by Gwaihir and his Great Eagles, only to flee at the command of Sauron when he sensed Frodo donning the Ring within Mount Doom.\n\nThere is a common misconception that these creatures are called Nazgûl, probably due to the fact that the unit in many video games (combined Fell beast and Ringwraith) was called a Nazgûl. Another possible explanation is the line in Return of the King where the Witch King says \"Do not come between the Nazgûl and his prey\" referring to himself, but shortly before, his mount had appeared to try to eat Théoden's horse.\n\nTolkien did not use  fell beast as a proper name, merely describing the animals as \"fell.\" Fell, a Middle English adjective (from the Old French fel \"cruel, dreadful\") has come to mean, in Modern English, \"ferocious, fierce, terrible, cruel, dreadful\", and implies an underlying malevolence or hostility that make the noun described all the worse for the ill-will that drives its suddenness and intensity. Given the rarity of fell (which had all but disappeared from Modern English until Tolkien's work revived it), the animals having no other name, Tolkien's fans often, if not quite correctly, have dubbed them \"fellbeasts\"--although philologists in general, and students of Tolkien's oeuvre in particular, look askance at such usage. (Cf, e.g., \"fell light in his eyes\" and \"fell meats.\")\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version of The Lord of the Rings, one of the Nazgûl (possibly the Witch-king, for he carries a mace), is shown riding a fell beast. However, Bakshi's film only covers events up to the Battle of the Hornburg, so that is the last we see of the fell beasts and their riders.\n\nIn the Rankin-Bass 1980 animated version of The Return of the King, the Nazgûl ride winged horses. But when Éowyn confronts the Witch-King he is riding a bird-like steed. Gandalf had called it a carrion-fowl. \n\nSee also:Witch-king's Fell Beast\n\nIn Peter Jackson's trilogy of movies based on The Lord of the Rings, the fell beasts are depicted as Wyverns (a two legged, flying serpentine creature that is similar to a Dragon), i.e. their heads appear more like a snake's and they don't have beaks. It is a common misconception that they are dragons in the books; Tolkien definitely meant a pterosaur-like creature, as shown in the quote above.\n\nAlthough on screen the film characters never make this mistake, sometimes actors on the commentary tracks refer to the winged creature as a Nazgûl; this is incorrect. The Fell-beast is the creature that the nine Nazgûl ride, and the mistake probably arose because Fell-beasts are always seen with a Nazgûl atop them.\n\nThe Witch-King in The Return of the King says specifically: \"Do not come between a Nazgûl and his prey.\" Though he commands the Fell Beast to eat Theoden he is referring to himself when he says Nazgûl, not the Fell-beast.\n\nClearly (at least in the movies and video games), Fell beasts were powerful creatures and were deadly offensive predators, especially with the Nazgûl on them. They could choose either to bite their prey (less attacking radius but increased damage) or swoop down on them (larger attacking radius), scattering enemies apart or outright crushing them. If a Fell beast snatched a soldier, it could easily fly high into the air and drop its helpless victim to his death far below. Fell beasts were feared for their ferocity and speed, and were known as the second fastest creatures in Middle-earth (The Eagles are faster).\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, the Fell Beasts could also breathe foul air on their opponents, weakening them significantly.\n\nOne other major use of the Fell beast was spreading Fear. From the very beginning, Fell Beasts are terrifying creatures. Combined with a Nazgûl's screech, very few enemies could hope to even stand up to them; only heroes could effectively hope to do so.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Fellbeast"}}

He was known by the Elves as Iarwain Ben-adar (\"Oldest and Fatherless\" in Sindarin), who dwelt in the valley of the river Withywindle, east of the Shire.","See also: The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, with special reference to Letters 144 and 153.","Goldberry described him as being \"Master of wood, water and hill.\" His power over supernatural beings is evidenced by both his freeing the Hobbits from Old Man Willow and his rescue of them from the Barrow-wights, whose cursed treasure he was also able to make clean. Here it is seen that the One Ring has no power over Bombadil; he can see Frodo when the Ring makes him invisible to others, and can wear it himself with no effect. He even tosses the Ring in the air and makes it disappear, but then produces it from his other hand and returns it to Frodo. While this seems to demonstrate that he has unique and mysterious power over the Ring, the idea of giving him the Ring for safekeeping is rejected in Book Two's second chapter, \"The Council of Elrond\". Gandalf says, rather, that \"the Ring has no power over him...\" and believes that Tom would not find the Ring to be very important and so might simply misplace it.","Paula Marmor notes that bobadil is an archaic word meaning \"braggart\", as seen in the character \"Captain Bobadill\" in the English play Every Man in His Humour. Because of its Bucklandish form, An Introduction to Elvish lists the name Bombadil under the \"Celtic-sounding names\". However, it is said that the word derives from Boabdil, the Spaniard name of Abu Abdillah Muhammad XII, the last Moorish ruler of Granada.","A common speculation is that Tom Bombadil could be a spiritual being closely connected to Eru Ilúvatar or perhaps Eru himself in corporeal form. This is due to the extent of Bombadil's unknown origin and powers, and also Bombadil's full embodiment of song and music which are trademarks of Eru.","The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, a book of verse published in 1962, purported to contain a selection of Hobbit poems, two of which were about Tom Bombadil and include his adventure with Badger folk. He also appears in the poem The Stone Troll, supposedly composed by Sam Gamgee and recorded in the Red Book of Westmarch, in which Tom mentions his \"nuncle\" Tim, on whose bones the troll is feeding, and he also mentions his father.","In many film and radio adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, Bombadil is notable by his absence, possibly because nobody knows quite what to do with him. Peter Jackson justified his omission of Bombadil from the film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring by pointing out that he did little to advance the story, having nothing to do with the Ring storyline, and serving little purpose when it came to getting the hobbits to Rivendell, and putting together the Fellowship. However, much of Bombadil's dialogue, and the scene in which the hobbits meet Old Man Willow, are transplanted into the scenes that Merry and Pippin share with Treebeard in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."],"name":"Tom Bombadil","description":"The origins and nature of Tom Bombadil are unknown; however, he already existed when the Dark Lord came to Arda, signifying he may have been alive even before the coming of the Valar. However, he may have been speaking in this instance of Melkor's second entry into Arda after he was driven out by the arrival of Tulkas, as to experience the \"dark under the stars\" would have only been possible after the creation of the stars, which occurred after Varda came with the other Valar to Arda.\n\nHis role and nature in the First Age is unknown, but he must have witnessed most of the major events and battles. He also witnessed the reducing of the great forests that covered all Middle-earth, and perhaps of his powers.\n\nThe level of his interactions with the outside world is also unclear; however, he seemed to have a name among many peoples and perhaps became a folkloric figure in the traditions and legends of Elves, Dwarves and Men. He has already also lived in the west much before the Elves went there and the tides were folded. It had been sometime in this period, probably, that he met the River-daughter, Goldberry, with whom he would eventually marry.\n\nIt is not known when Tom settled into his domain outside the Old Forest, but it is clear, by the time of the War of the Ring, that he has been there for quite some time. Farmer Maggot of Marish in the Eastfarthing and a few Bucklanders knew him and were friendly with him.\n\nIn TA 3018, Frodo and his company had a chance meeting with Bombadil in the Old Forest after a nearly disastrous encounter with Old Man Willow. Frodo, who had fled from the tree looking for help, enlisted Bombadil, who had been out gathering water lilies. Bombadil went immediately with Frodo to the tree and commanded it to release its prisoners, Merry and Pippin, which it immediately did. He then invited Frodo and his companions to his home, where the Hobbits had an almost dreamlike stay, feasting and making merry with Tom. In this state, Frodo rather inadvertently told Tom all about the Ring and his quest, and when Tom asked to inspect the Ring, Frodo, without question and without any of the reluctance that tended to accompany giving the Ring to another, allowed him to. Tom then put the Ring on his finger, yet not only did he not disappear, but the Ring appeared to have no effect on him at all. After making the Ring itself vanish with a sleight-of-hand trick, he returned it to Frodo, who, slightly suspicious that it had not made Tom vanish, put it on to make sure it was the genuine Ring. Tom surprised him yet again by revealing that he could see Frodo even with the Ring on, and told Frodo to remove it, stating that his hand was fairer without it.\n\nAfter two days resting and feasting at Tom's home, the Hobbits set out again, only to be captured the next day by Wights on the Barrow-downs Fortunately, Tom once again came to their rescue, dispersing the Wights and breaking open their tomb. After this, he escorted the Hobbits to the borders of his land and left them there.\n\nThe peril of the hobbits was not over; an attack on their lives was carried out, and their ponies were set loose. The ponies apparently remembered the care they were given in the house of Tom Bombadil, and returned to stay beside Tom's own pony, Fatty Lumpkin. He returned them to Barliman Butterbur, the proprietor of The Prancing Pony. Since he had paid eighteen pence as compensation for the loss, he was now the owner of five fine ponies.\n\nOver a month later, Tom became a topic of discussion at the Council of Elrond. There, Elrond, who had apparently met Tom in times long past, reminisced about him briefly before the question was put before the Council of whether or not to give the Ring to Tom, as it appeared as though Tom may have had power over even the Ring within his lands. However, Gandalf quickly dismissed the idea, saying that rather than Tom having power over the Ring, the Ring simply had no power over Tom. He was immune to its influence, but he could not alter it. There is however evidence of Toms ability to effect the rings power over others, as we see Frodo freely give the ring to Tom without the usual hesitation or protective behaviours. Additionally, he said that, while Tom might be willing to take the Ring if asked by all the Free People of the world, he might do so, but would not understand the reason. Due to this, Tom would have likely either forgot about it or thrown it away, as such things had little relevance to him. It was also mentioned that taking the Ring back to him would be impossible to accomplish without it becoming known to Sauron, and that sooner or later, Sauron would bend all his power towards Tom's realm to take the Ring back. Despite his mastery within his realm, it was assumed that Tom would not have cared or been able to keep the Ring contained to his realm.\n\nFour years after the One Ring was destroyed, Gandalf spent some time with Bombadil. It is unknown how the meeting was or what they discussed between them. Gandalf remarked to the Hobbits that Bombadil would doubtless have little interest in the tales of their adventures, except perhaps their encounters with the Ents.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tom_Bombadil"}}

He was, and still is, Tolkien's most renowned character for his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore the One Ring to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best friend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who sailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third Age.","Frodo, as described by Gandalf, was \"taller than some and fairer than most, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.\" (The Fellowship of the Ring, Chapter 10, \"Strider\") He was a shy, young hobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had lighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his Brandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a hobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is fifty, due to the influence of the Ring. Bilbo and Frodo shared a common birthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the opening of The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo and Bilbo were celebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays, respectively. Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in Hobbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world, fascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Bilbo travelled in The Hobbit) did not fit the general content personality of most Hobbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his Took ancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Gollum and allowing him to guide him and Sam to Mordor despite Sam's distrust of the creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the quest's success in destroying the Ring. The influence of the Ring and the wound by the Morgul-Blade seems combined to have given him the ability to see into the spirit world, for instance he sees faraway events in his dreams on several occasions. He also can see the ring of power worn by Galadriel and he seems to be able to sense danger.","Frodo was dressed in typical Hobbit-fashion when he left the Shire: knee breeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright green and yellow were typical for Shire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a pocketknife.","Frodo used Bilbo's famed short sword Sting for melee combat, it was also put to great use as it warns him of nearby orcs and goblins by glowing blue.","Originally, Frodo was to be named Bingo Bolger-Baggins, but as the work became more serious, that name was dropped.","Christopher Guard voiced Frodo in Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) with Sharon Baird doing the modeling.","Orson Bean voiced Frodo in the Rankin\/Bass The Return of the King film.","Arwen, Elrond's daughter, leads Frodo to Rivendell instead of Glorfindel.

In the novel, Faramir declared right from the first that he wanted no part of the One Ring, but in the film Faramir at first follows what he believes is his duty to bring the Ring back to Minas Tirith. But while travelling with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum through the city of Osgiliath, the city is attacked by a Nazgûl and the forces of Mordor, and Faramir realizes he should not take the Ring after he sees the effect it has on Frodo.","He is also portrayed by Taneli Mäkelä in the Finnish 1993 production Hobbit.","Frodo was voiced by Oliver Burt in The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series), James Arrington in The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series), Ian Holm in The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series), Nigel Planer in Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series), Elijah Wood in Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and Steve Staley in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game).","Frodo was portrayed by Lauren Lopez in a parody of Lord of the Rings by the group Team Starkid."],"name":"Frodo Baggins","description":"Much of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the ancestral home of the Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula Brandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending Meriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing trouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer Maggot's farm Bamfurlong.  \n\nIn TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in Brandy Hall until his 99-year-old \"uncle\" Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989. Bilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him his heir.\n\nThe two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of the Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the lore of Middle-earth. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12\u201314 of our calendar), and a party of special magnificence was held at the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo hit the peculiar year of 111.\n\nBilbo gave a memorable Birthday Speech before playing a joke on his fellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where Bilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the Party were left confused and disgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.\n\nBefore departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long conversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily surrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a note for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.\n\nAfter the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was now the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic ring. Gandalf, ever more curious about the ring's origin, power, and purpose (but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit against the using the ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied with the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on April 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the Ring was actually the One Ring, which the evil lord Sauron needed to rule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the Ring, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to Rivendell.\n\nAfter Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was running out of money. This rumor, although not begun by Frodo, was encouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at Crickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had agreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of the Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the Sackville-Baggins, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and Pippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as Sauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazgûl, had entered the Shire dressed as Black riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.\n\nFrodo was unable to find much information about his pursuers from his conversations with the High Elves and Farmer Maggot, but what they were told was less than encouraging. When Frodo arrived at Buckland, where Merry was waiting, he found that Merry and Pippin already knew about Frodo's \"secret\" journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to bring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and the Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed. They met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man Willow and the Barrow-Wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a mysterious being who dwelled in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.\n\nIn Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went by the name of Mr. Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as possible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the shadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man, a Ranger, as Strider.\n\nThat night, black riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search of Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits from them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself as Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the backstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a pony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo and his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to Rivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to the top of Weathertop.\n\nOn the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of the nine Ringwraiths at the hill of Weathertop. In the presence of the Nazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to resist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the name of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader of the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder (he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-blade. If it had caught him in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker and under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the appearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had torches, one of their few weaknesses.\n\nThough Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A fragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it continued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was rescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his horse, named Asfaloth. They were pursued by the Nazgûl as Asfaloth carried Frodo to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of Rivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, Frodo turned and saw the Nine Ringwraiths on the other side. They ordered him to give up the Ring, but Frodo refused.\n\nSubsequently, the Ringwraiths were washed away in a flood called up by Elrond, the leader of Rivendell. He was healed in Rivendell by Elrond, although both of them knew that the wound would never fully heal, as it was as spiritual as it was physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo awoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to bother him for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.\n\nAfter his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had organized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth discussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One Ring must be destroyed. As the ring was shown and tempers flared, argument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission, until Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it into the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples offered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nThe Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of the Dwarves. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made coat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had been given to Bilbo by Thorin after the events of The Hobbit, and Sting had been taken by Bilbo from the den of a troll. On December 25, the Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.\n\nOn January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty Mountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due to a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of Moria at the urging of Gimli. \n\nMoria (also named Khazad-dum), was the most ancient and grand of Dwarven cities, but was deserted when the dwarves uncovered a Balrog, known only as Durin's Bane, beneath the city, and had been defeated by legions of goblins. When they entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship was attacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll before he was stabbed by an orc captain, his mithril shirt saving him from a deadly blow. The Fellowship ran through Moria to the Bridge of Khazad-dum, where Gandalf fell while confronting Durin's Bane. Once outside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and Sam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.\n\nDeeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven kingdom of Lothlórien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror. Frodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take it, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the diminishing of the power of the elves. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a phial with the light of the star Eärendil captured inside; this gift would prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also provided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and ships for their voyage down the Anduin River.\n\nThe Fellowship continued their journey south to Amon Hen. There, Boromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there. When the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir followed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested course of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.\n\nFrodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he watched as war brewed across Middle-Earth and the Eye of Sauron searching for him as he traveled.\n\nTaking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have Sam's company.\n\nThe two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Here Boromir was killed by uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the two young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken to Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three Hunters decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their captors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.\n\nAfter leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam tried to navigate through the winding paths of the Emyn Muil. After getting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first tried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help) and tied up with the elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and into the Dead Marshes.\n\nThe Dead Marshes followed the razor-sharp rocks of Emyn Muil, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum had secretly discovered a path when out on one of his many errands. He led Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.\n\nGollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had desired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger was too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the stairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves being led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a skirmish between a company of warriors from Haradrim (along with Oliphaunts) and rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the ranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir blindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth Annûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Samwise foolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One Ring. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality, unlike his brother, Boromir, and let the ring-bearer go free. Later, Gollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the hidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed, although the rift between master and servant had once again begun to open.\n\nGollum led the Hobbits past the lair of the Witch-King of Angmar, Minas Morgul, and up the stairs into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the top though, they were abandoned by Gollum. They cautiously travelled through the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way barred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the webbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further into the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the threads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself safe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak out and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's webbing, Samwise was able to draw her into single combat wherein he, using Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her and drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's neck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He overheard the orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master was not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the tower of Cirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.\n\nFrodo was taken to the utmost top of Cirith Ungol and imprisoned.  He was stripped of all his clothes and all the things he carried. Squabbling over his mithril vest, fighting broke out amongst the two lead orcs and their battalions, killing almost all the orcs and Uruk-hai in the tower. Sam arrived at the gate of Cirith Ungol, only to find his way blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, journeyed to the tower where Frodo was held, and rescued his master. They fled the tower, having to pass the Watchers again (although this time destroying them), and entered Mordor.\n\nFrodo and Sam crawled onward through the empty plains of Mordor, as the orcs had been sent to the Black Gate to stop the Men of the West's army, and, after falling in and out of a company of Orcs, started to climb Mount Doom. They journeyed on for many days with hardly any food or water, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over him grew the closer they came to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable to go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance while his master rested upon his back. It was then that Gollum decided to reappear, and after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach, and Frodo fled up the mountain.\n\nInside the Crack of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the ring, and rid himself of his burden, but the power of the ring was at its strongest, due to the proximity of the cracks. It was here that Frodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the ring. Sam yelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its power and claimed the Ring for himself. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell and hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put on the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was reunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he toppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying himself and the One Ring.\n\nThe two hobbits tried to escape as the volcano erupted. Just as it looked as though they were doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them, and with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor rescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to safety.\n\nAfter recovering in Minas Tirith, and witnessing the coronation of King Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. When they arrived though, they found it under the control of a man named Sharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was ruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Grima Wormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin however, started to gather all the Shirriffs and townsfolk in the Shire, and they successfully defeated the Ruffians employed by Sharkey at the Battle of Bywater.\n\nFrodo wasn't directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater; instead, he made sure that no Hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit had ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire and that it was not going to begin there), and also that any ruffians that surrendered were not harmed.\n\nFrodo briefly served as Deputy Mayor of the Shire, but soon realized that he still bore the wounds of his quest, and so retired. He was also in continual pain from his shoulder wound, which pained him each anniversary of their stay on Weathertop. On 22 September SR 1421 (Fourth Age), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Círdan aboard an Elven ship. He was allowed passage across the sea to the Undying Lands, as he was a ring-bearer, with the hope of healing the damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused. Sometime after the year 61 in the Fourth Age, fellow ring-bearer and best friend Samwise Gamgee, reunited with Frodo in the undying lands where it was presumed they lived out the remainder of their days.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Frodo_Baggins"}}

He was the only child of Saradoc Brandybuck (TA 2940 - FO 11), Master of Buckland, and Esmeralda Took (TA 2936 - ?), the younger sister of Paladin Took II , making him first cousin to Paladin's son Pippin, who was clearly his closest friend.\n\nMerry was considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits, for example, even before Frodo Baggins leaves the Shire, he knew of the One Ring and its power. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party, protecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind \"the Conspiracy\" of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger (more commonly known as \"Fatty\", due to his plump form) and himself to help Frodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring begins, Merry was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. His shortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided the Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the Barrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.\n\nAt Bree, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Frodo foolishly put on the ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by the Nazgûl who arrived. At Rivendell, he was seen studying maps and plotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a little less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two to relay news to the people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end Gandalf, believing in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam, requested that Elrond allow the two hobbits to come along. At Amon Hen he was captured along with Pippin by a band of Saruman's fighting Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Boromir valiantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.\n\nEscaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, Treebeard and the newly risen Gandalf the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant amounts of Entwash, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair growth. Accompanying Treebeard to the Entmoot, and later to Isengard, he and Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here that Merry encountered King Théoden of Rohan, and was reunited with the remaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).\n\nSeparated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to Gondor, Merry swore fealty to Théoden and became his squire. Without permission from his liege, he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of young Dernhelm (who was actually Éowyn, though Merry didn't know it). When Nazgûl attacked the Riders of Rohan and Théoden was injured, Merry and Éowyn faced the Witch King of Angmar alone. Here, Merry's companion revealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both fell beast and the Nazgûl alone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, built for this very purpose, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the Ringwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He cut the Witch King behind the knee as he was about to kill Eowyn. This was enough to allow Éowyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Théoden's last words, but went unnoticed by the honour escort of Riders and was found wandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Aragorn and recovered fully.\n\nFor his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Rohan, knighted him and gave him the name of \"Holdwine\". During the Scouring of the Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the Horn of Rohan presented to him by Éowyn.\n\nUpon their return he and Pippin both got married to beautiful hobbit women. They were also the tallest of hobbits, taller even than the legendary Bandobras \"Bullroarer\" Took, due to their having drunk large amounts of Entwater. Merry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age. He became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11). He wrote Old Words and Names in the Shire. Although he was not recorded as having any children within the family trees, he clearly had at least one son. At the age of 102, he returned to Rohan and Gondor with Pippin, dying there around the year FO 64. He was laid to rest in Gondor, and when Elessar died in the Fourth Age 120, he and Pippin were entombed beside the great king.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Meriadoc_Brandybuck"}}

Tar-Meneldur encouraged the seafarers, and allowed his son Aldarion to establish a guild of seafarers, which became one of the most powerful organisations in Númenor. Many voyages along the coasts were made at this time, and the first settlements were made in Middle-earth by Númenórean explorers, although none of them permanent yet. These early settlements were however the later cores of Arnor and Gondor, and the reestablished contact of Númenóreans with their distant kin allowed the Adûnaic tongue to merge with local, far akin languages, eventually leading to the Westron speech. This would in later years prove to be one of the greatest assets to the power of Númenor in Middle-earth.\n\nNear the end of Tar-Meneldur's rule reports came that evil had begun to stir in the east of Middle-earth (the first awakenings of Sauron, as was later learned), and Gil-galad requested the aid of Tar-Meneldur. Recognizing his son Aldarion was more aware of the troubles, and was a powerful leader of men, Meneldur abdicated in favour of his son far earlier than was expected.\n\nOn the family front Meneldur, together with his wife Almarian, attempted to mediate between his son Aldarion and Aldarion's betrothed Erendis, who had become estranged.

Additionally, there is as skull-like bony crest covering the upper jaw and face with small, rather blank-looking eyes. Drakes do not have vivid horns on the heads as dragons do, and have large jaws resembling those of crocdiles.\n\nBeing more scaly and spiky than fell beasts, drakes may be more heavily built than the former creature, especially in regards to their tails and hind legs, but at the same time have slightly shorter necks and tails than fell beasts. Along with fell beasts, one or more of these creatures were ridden by the Nazgûl, including the Witch-king of Angmar. Overall, silhouette of the drakes seen in the game resemble fell beasts far more than they resemble Smaug.\n\nThere is another type of drake, with distinctive beaks, tail protuberances, and horns. This breed is more akin to Hell Hawk, an alias and original description for the Fell beasts in the books.\n\nAs being kin of dragons, drakes have high potential in terms of engaging and attacking enemies, and in regards flying. They can use two types of breath: flamethrower-like fire and fire balls. Despite being slim compared other land-dwelling monsters (such as the Graug), drakes may be surprisingly durable and powerful.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Drake"}}

His lair is located in the Grey Mountains.

In the final days during the battles at Minas Tirith, Erebor and Mirkwood, the Black Numenorean, Agandaur, made a deal with Urgost. The two decreed that if Agandaur won the dwarf mountain of Nordinbad, then Urgost would offer his allegiance to him and his master Sauron. Agandaur left behind some Uruk-hai and Men of Carn Dum to await Urgost's answer as he plotted against Nordinbad.\n\nUnbeknownst to Urgost, three heroes Eradan, Andriel, and Farin had swept through the forces Agandaur left behind. As they entered his lair, Urgost slammed down and roared with rage and irritation, believing them to be servants of Agandaur. When he realized they were not, Urgost asked why they were here. When he got his answer, he told them about Agandaur's offer and that he actually had no interest in Nordinbad and had a mind to conquer Carn Dum instead. He was not afraid to fight Agandaur for it, but he knew that he would make an enemy of Sauron if he did. As powerful as he and his dragon kin are, the dark lord would have surely sought to hunt him down if that was the case. Instead he promised to the heroes that he would not join Sauron's forces and remain neutral, if they would turn over Carn Dum to him, since it would be uninhabited after the Numenorean was slain. He then tells the heroes to hurry if they wish to save Nordinbad, for Agandaur is moving against it at that very moment. When they're about to leave Urgost sarcastically says, \"Oh yes. By all means, hurry.\" and backs away laughing.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Morannon, the three heroes dueled and destroyed Agandaur. With his destruction, Urgost flew out from his lair and soared onward to Carn Dum. He confronted the heroes again, and breathed out his immense flames upon landing. Urgost had sensed that Sauron was destroyed, and that he had been wise not to ally with him. The dragon reminded the heroes of their bargain, and they told him their deal is kept. Urgost flew off to enjoy his new lair, and the three heroes left Carn Dum astride Beleram, one of the Great Eagles to Rivendell earning their well-deserved rest.\n\nUrgost, like any fire-drake, is immsensely large. His claws are razor-sharp, and he has a crown-like array of horns and spines on his head, which extends down his neck and back. His skin is reddish brown all over with a hint of black, flaming yellow eyes, and a wide jaw with large teeth. In total, he strongly resembles his kin in early days such as Smaug.\n\nUrgost is very much like Smaug for many reasons. Like any normal dragon in middle earth, Urgost is ferocious, greedy, intelligent, and powerful. Unlike the dragons of Morgoth in the First Age, he has no allegiance to Sauron, Agandaur, or any of the other dark powers. As long as his desire is fulfilled, he has no intention to cause absurd harms on free folks (this trend could be said for any other dragons after the banishment of Morgoth, including Smaug).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Urgost"}}

They helped to begin the shaping of Arda through the music of Ilúvatar and often referred to one another as brother or sister. Each of the Ainur added his or her own part to the music creating the world incarnate. All except Melkor. His vision of what Arda should have been was different than Eru's. This led to the casting out of Melkor and his great rebellion that caused so many of the ills of the world of Arda. The Valar originally dwelt on the hidden Isle of Almaren, but after its destruction, long before the Awakening of the Elves, they moved to Aman and founded Valinor.\n\nThe Valar were powers of the world created by Ilúvatar, or Eru, who rarely directly intervened in the world's course of events. They were part of the Hierarchy of Spirits that is a major part of the Tolkien Myth. Eru (the One), also called Ilúvatar by the Elves, was the Creator. The angel-like spirits he created were the Ainur, which comprised the Valar and the Maiar. The Valar were the greatest of the Ainur, but the Maiar were also spirits whose being began before the world, of the same order as the Valar but of less degree.\n\nThough less powerful than the Valar, the Maiar were powerful nonetheless, and included Melian, Sauron, Olórin (later known as Gandalf) and the other Istari, the Balrogs, and many others. A Maia would often associate himself with a particular Vala. For example, Ossë and Uinen, powers of the oceans, served under Ulmo, while Curumo (later known as Saruman), served Aulë the Smith. Sauron also served Aulë before he was corrupted by Melkor.\n\nIt was originally Melkor's intention to rule Arda for himself, but Manwë called other spirits to help him confront Melkor. Among these were the other Valar and the Maiar. Melkor withdrew from Arda, and the others continued their creation of the World. But Melkor saw this, and returned to fight for control of Arda.\n\nThese are the names of the Valar as they were known to the Eldar. In Middle-earth, they were known by other names of Sindarin origin; for example they called Varda Elbereth. Men knew them by many other names, and sometimes worshipped them as Gods. The elves called Varda, the creator of the stars, Elentári. The dwarves called Aulë, their creator, Mahal. The ents called Yavanna, their creator, Kementári. It should be noted that, with the exception of Oromë, the names listed below are not actual names but rather titles: the true names of the Valar are nowhere recorded. Male Valar are called \"Lords of the Valar\"; females are called \"Ladies of the Valar,\" or Valier.\n\nThe Aratar (Sindarin: Exalted) or High Ones of Arda are the eight greatest of the Valar: Manwë, Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aulë, Mandos, Nienna, and Oromë. Melkor, the most powerful of all, is not counted among them.\n\nLórien and Mandos are brothers and are referred to jointly as the Fëanturi or \"Masters of Spirits\".\n\nJust like all other Ainur, the powers of the Valar are very mysterious, however good guesses can be made.\n\nThe Valar most likely have similar, though superior, abilities to the Maiar, which include light and fire control. They can undoubtedly shift forms. The Valars mere presence can place humans and elves in a trance. Manwe and Ulmo can both control and perceive massive volumes of matter at once, perhaps giving evidence of advanced intelligence. Yavana and Nessa\u2019s efforts combined could create Laurilein, which had at the very least thousands of Sun-like flowers, and Telperion, who made the light for millions of stars.\n\nVarda could lift enormous stars that weigh billions of metric exatons, and move at presumably FTL speeds to do this. One possibility is that the Aniur can move at infinite speeds in empty space.\n\nAnother possibility is time travel (though inability to effect). About the Aniur it was said \u201CAll that was past they could fully perceive\u201D\n\nIt seems that even this power might be simply a restricted form. this seems likely is what they did in the Anulindale was FAR more impressive than anything else they did (ie: Melkor creating discord with his thoughts).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Valar"}}

During the War of the Ring, Nordri's people were threatened by a Black Numenorean named Agandaur, a dark sorcerer and the right hand of the dark lord, Sauron. Agandaur came to Nordinbad under parley, and demanded that Nordri and Gorin turn over Nordinbad to him and his army, and if they do, their lives would be spared and they could seek out a new home. Of course, Nordri's father refused, and in his wrath, Agandaur warned them that for their defiance, a fiery doom will come upon them and destroy them all.\n\nAfterward, Nordri leads a mission to reactivate an ancient weapon within the Orc-infested peak of Mount Gundabad, with the knowledge that they would surely die. Accompanied by his friend Bruni, Nordri and his companions fought through many orcs, as well as Mountain-trolls and Uruk-hai. Only Bruni and himself eventually made it to the chamber of the weapon, where they were surrounded by a horde of enemies. As they made ready to fight to the end, three strange warriors - Eradan of the Dunedain, Andriel of Rivendell, and Farin of the Lonely Mountain - arrived to their aid, and drove the enemy wave back. Nordri told them of their plan to activate the weapon and crush the orcs, to which they agreed to safeguard them while they activate it. After waves of enemies repeatedly attacked them, Nordri and Bruni eventually activated the weapon, which brought the whole mountain down upon the orcs, and they would eventually be brought down with it. Nordri apologized to the three heroes for getting them killed with them, but in that moment, three Great Eagles flew into the mountain and flew them out before the mountain collapsed upon them.\n\nWhen they returned to Nordinbad, Nordri introduced the three heroes to his father, who thanked him for bringing Nordri back alive and for saving their home. Eradan, Farin and Andriel then tell them they had gone to Gundabad in search of Agandaur, and Nordri and Gorin told them about their meeting with him. When they mention his warning of the \"fiery doom,\" they fear that Agandaur had allied himself with Urgost, a dragon who lives farther east. Nonetheless, the heroes agree to go after the dragon, and Nordri mentions that they can find Urgost's dwelling with help from Radagast the Brown, who dwells in the forests of Mirkwood.\n\nAfter Farin, Eradan and Andriel leave to find Radagast and locate Urgost, Agandaur had once again plotted against Nordinbad. The dark servant of Sauron had unleashed an immense army of Orcs, Uruk-hai, Goblins, Olog-hai and Men of Carn Dum. They had launched catapults upon them and amassed siege towers on the walls, and in the chaos, Bruni was killed. Farin, Andriel and Eradan returned from Urgost's lair to aid Nordri and his kinsmen, telling them to go back inside the mountain and defend the rest of their people. The heroes were able to drive back waves of enemies, but their eagle companion, Beleram, had been gravely injured, whilst Baranthor and Armenel had been killed. When the battle had ended, Nordri promised the heroes that Beleram would have the best care they could give Beleram.\n\nNordri and his people survived the bloody siege, but at the cost of so many kinsmen. Long after the three heroes left for Carn Dum to finish off Agandaur, Beleram had left the dwarves' care to go and aid his allies.\n\nAfter Agandaur's defeat and the destruction of Sauron, the Fourth Age of Middle-Earth had begun. Nordri and his fellow dwarves rebuilt Nordinbad. It was also later revealed that Farin had told Gloin, a fellow Longbeard, the existence of Nordinbad, and that he would be happy to establish trade between them and the dwarves of Erebor, now ruled by King Thorin Stonehelm.

Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the wounded Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, but he declared that Prince Imrahil should rule the City until Faramir awoke, in effect granting Imrahil the position of Steward.\n\nDuring the debate of the Captains of the West, Gandalf proposed that they march to the Black Gate to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo the Ring-bearer. Imrahil said that he would follow his liege Aragorn, but since Minas Tirith was under his command the Prince advised that some should remain to defend the City.

Rateliff, in the never completed third revision of The Hobbit, Bombur, along with Bifur and Bofur were to become something like an honour-guard to Thorin.

Bombur was not of Durin's line although he was descended from dwarves of Moria. His birth year is also unknown. However, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to Erebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the 13 \"by some fifty years\" and that after Thorin had been captured, Balin was \"the eldest left\". Since Fíli was born in T.A. 2859 and Balin was born in 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763 and 2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue Mountains with Thorin after the loss of Thráin The II.\n\nBombur is the twelfth Dwarf to arrive at Bag End. Because he counts for two, he is the last to enter Beorn's house and the last to cross the Enchanted river in Mirkwood. Bombur is first introduced when he tumbles with Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they enter Bag End, and he also is knocked into the Enchanted river (and falls asleep). He chooses to stay and guard the supplies camp while the others move up Lonely Mountain because he trusts neither mountain paths nor ropes. Later though, he is forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon Smaug.\n\nBombur sleeps at several key moments in the book. When he is violently knocked into the Mirkwood River by an aggressive stag, he falls under a spell that makes him sleep for days, burdening the others with his weight as they walked on. And while he is on a midnight lookout in the fortified Lonely Mountain, Bilbo promises to keep watch so that he can sleep a bit longer and take another watch later (Bilbo used this opportunity to sneak the Arkenstone out of the mountain). Incidentally, he was asleep when they opened his barrel after escaping the Elves of Mirkwood and also when Bilbo discovered the secret entrance to Lonely Mountain. Bombur is always last and doesn't enjoy it. When the Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo meet Beorn, Bombur comes last. He comes along straight after Bifur and Bofur so he won't be last. He fought at and survived the Battle of the Five Armies. Following the defeat of Smaug, Dain II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure and he remained to live at the Lonely Mountain.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings, many years later, Frodo Baggins inquires after Bombur and learns that he has grown so fat it takes six Dwarves to lift him to the dinner table. It is unlikely that Bombur fought in the Battle of Dale due to his weight.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bombur"}}

(Christopher Tolkien identified \"uruks\" as an \"anglicisation\" of \"Uruk-hai\".) In The Lord of the Rings, Saruman's orcs identify themselves as the \"fighting Uruk-hai\", and so Uruk-hai is the common term used to refer to them. A tracker-orc in Mordor makes reference to a \"pack of rebel Uruk-hai\", apparently in reference towards Gorbag's troop of orcs who were Uruks of Mordor."],"name":"Uruk-hai","description":"Tolkien described the Uruk-hai of Isengard as large, smart orcs with slanted eyes, thick legs, and large hands. They were armed with bows made of yew and short, broad-bladed swords. The Isengarders' equipment was noted as quite different from normal orcish gear.\n\nUruk-hai were first created by Sauron late in the Third Age. In the War of the Ring, the Uruk-hai made up a large part of Saruman's Army, together with the Dunlendings, man-enemies of Rohan. There are suggestions that the Uruk-hai were the result of crossbreeding orcs and men. Certainly, there were other creatures in Saruman's armies, and under his command in the Shire, that appear to have been hybrids. \"Half-orcs\" were as tall as Men and are never described simply as orcs, as the Uruk-hai frequently are. Saruman's army of Uruk-hai fought against King Théoden of Rohan and his people at Helm's Deep.\n\nThe Uruks first appeared about the year TA 2475, when they conquered Ithilien and destroyed the city of Osgiliath. The Uruks in the service of Barad-dûr, the folk of Mordor, used the symbol of the red Eye of Sauron. The Red Eye was also painted on their shields. The Uruks of Saruman the White used an 'S' Elf-rune wrought in white metal on the front of their iron helms. It was clear this 'S' stood for Saruman, because their shields had a small white hand (the symbol of Saruman) centered on a black field. Aragorn commented that their gear was not in the manner of other orcs at all. Instead of the curved scimitar, they used short, broad-bladed swords. Their great bows were made of yew wood, of the same length and shape as those of men. Unlike the smaller orcs of the Misty Mountains, the Isengarders appeared indifferent to the Sun.\n\nSaruman appeared to aid his orcs with his wizardry as well: when Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas followed the party of Uruks who kidnapped Merry and Pippin, Saruman's will caused weariness of the heart for the pursuers and lent speed to the orcs. This was the group that slew Boromir, and was annihilated by Éomer and the Riders of Rohan.\n\nUruk-hai was a Black Speech word that meant \"Orc-folk\". The name \"Uruk-hai\" has the element Uruk, which was a Black Speech word related to orc, related to the (Valinórean) Quenya word urko (Ñoldorin Quenya: orko) of the same meaning. The element hai means \"folk\", so \"Uruk-hai\" is \"Orc-folk\". A similar term is Olog-hai (\"troll-folk\"), used for a breed of especially strong and vicious trolls capable of surviving sunlight.\n\nChristopher Tolkien describes \"uruks\" as an Anglicization of \"Uruk-hai\" and his father used the two terms interchangeably a number of times. Some readers assume the two terms are different because in The Lord of the Rings 'Uruk-hai' is used primarily to describe Saruman's forces while 'uruks' and 'Black Uruks of Mordor' are used primarily to describe Sauron's. However, there are examples of each term being used in reference to either group. While 'Uruk-hai' means simply 'Orc-folk', the term was reserved for the soldier orcs of Mordor and Isengard, with snaga ('slave') being their term for other breeds.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy by Peter Jackson, Saruman appeared to be the only one who created the Uruks. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf mentioned of Saruman breeding the Uruks to possess the traits of orcs and goblin men without the two races' weaknesses. However, the book Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare cleared up this discrepancy by explaining that he is in fact only replicating the method that had already been used by Sauron. Sauron's uruks, seen in The Return of the King, have noticeably rougher features than Saruman's. They are shown in the movie as being released from a kind of membrane in the mud deep under Isengard (special commentary on the DVD edition explained that they were trying to base the scene on an early description of Tolkien's that orcs \"worm their way out of the ground like maggots\").\n\nHis Uruks include pikemen, swordsmen, crossbowmen, sappers, scouts, and berserkers. The berserkers are even larger and more vicious Uruks. They shave their heads and fill their helmets with human blood, so that when they put on the helmets the blood runs down their backs and its scent sends them into a killing frenzy. They carry double-bent swords. These swords were feared by their Rohirrim enemies for good reason. First, they had double spikes on the end (used for hamstringing or disemboweling horses). Second, the tremendous strength of the berserkers could easily take the head off of any human. Last, they had a keen cutting edge that could easily cut through the leather armor of the Rohirrim (for the massive swords were powerful enough to cut through even steel armor). The sappers were responsible for crewing the ballistae, handling the ladders and carrying Saruman's bombs.\n\nPikemen, as the name suggests, carry pikes and, likewise, crossbowmen carry crossbows. Normal Uruk infantry wield swords and shields. These swords maximize the brute strength of the Uruks, being able to cut off limbs and heads very easily. The upward-pointing spike on the end was an ingenious addition by Saruman, a learned scholar skilled in the arts of warfare. Knowing that he would be facing the legendary Rohirrim cavalry, the additional spike could pull a rider from his horse with minimal effort and either kill or disable his mount. It also served as a terror weapon, sending many shivers down the spine of even experienced soldiers. Given that Saruman wished to make a great army of destructive soldiers quickly, he devoted more time to arming and birthing his Uruks than he did training them. Given the quickened births of his second batch of Uruk-hai warriors, they were unable to be trained in many tactics of war.\n\nMost of their weapons show this, requiring little thought to be used. The sword would hack an enemy with the straight side in one direction then stab the enemy with the jutting bladed part on the other side, repeated until the Uruk either died or ran out of things to kill. They also sometimes use bladed shields with the white hand painted on them, as seen in Amon Hen during Aragorn's fight against Lurtz. These were broad shields, made of durable iron that could defend well against incoming attacks and would provide an alternative weapon by using the bladed side, should the Uruk lose his other weapon. Scouts wear light, leather armor and have leather helmets with no crests or brims, and wield short swords, axes, daggers, and powerful bows of yew with a tremendous draw weight. Their armor is grey and is made up of large lames and has a groin guard. Underneath is a layer of chainmail that covers the torso, half the arm and a small fraction of the legs. They also wear arm armor but they have bare legs. For footwear they have puttees and sandals that are covered by foot and leg armor. The helmets vary. Heavy Uruk helms are metal caps with an eye slit, horizontal crests and two smaller crests at either side of the mouth. Crossbow and engineer helms are a simple metal cap that covers the top half of the head (just the eyes on the face) and have huge brims at the bottom. Berserker helms have two circular eyeholes and an empty space for the mouth. They have no crests or brims. Commander helms are basically berserker helms with massive crests. Almost all the helms have the white hand of Saruman painted on them. Despite the strong iron used in most of an Isengard Uruk-hai's armor, it provided little protection at joints, so as to not constrict movement, or at the back, as Saruman was to use them for attack purposes and would not expect any form of flanking attack.\n\nAs the Isengard Uruk-hai were an army that was being rapidly grown, mass production of arms was required to equip them quickly. The metal weapons used by the Isengard uruks, as depicted in The Fellowship of the Ring, are likely made from iron (or possibly steel) melted in a foundry, cast in open molds, then forged, and finally finished by sharpening on grindstones. Armor and helmets are also seen being hammered and shaped en masse. Though the weapons and armor were competently crafted, the quality is depicted as relatively crude compared to the more finely honed weapons of the elves, men, and Dwarves. This lack of quality is not shown as hindering effectiveness.\n\nMordor Uruk-hai differ greatly from their Isengard kin. While the Uruk-hai of Isengard were uniformly well-armed, using hardened iron armour, shields, and wielding well-crafted yet simple weaponry, Mordor's Black Uruks wore scraps of black leather armour with hoods along with chainmail and would use any sort of weapon they came across. Additionally, while most of the Uruk-hai of Saruman were rushed in their birthings, needing to amass an army quickly, Sauron's Uruk-hai were not, having no need to create an army of Uruk-hai quickly when he had innumerable garrisons of orcs, trolls, evil men, and all manner of other maleficent beings under his command that could be sent forth at any time he wished, and so were able to be bred fully, rising to their full capacities.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Uruk-hai"}}

With his Goblins, Half-trolls, and Corsairs, he eliminates any Ents and Elves that attempt to make a defense. After they are destroyed, Gorkil creates a base and marches upon the Grey Havens. More Elves try to stop them, but like the warriors of the Beach defense, all are again slain. When the Goblin Army arrives upon the Grey Havens, Gorkil commands it to destroy every building and elf in the area. Gorkil leads the destruction to two of three Elven fortresses, while Corsair ships destroy the third. The Grey Havens are utterly destroyed and the Elves flee into the woods, their hopes of escaping to the west gone forever. Gorkil and his army then heads to the Shire, ready to settle an ancient feud.\n\nIn Mission 3, Gorkil prepares his army to destroy the Shire. A previous goblin, Golfimbul, had attempted to attack the Shire but was killed. This Battle of Greenfields was still deep in the minds of the Goblins, and now Gorkil prepares to settle the score once and for all. Gorkil commands his troops to destroy four Seats of Power, which keep the Hobbits motivated to retaliate. After building a base and mustering an army, they get help from the Wild Men of Dunland and Mountain Giants. Gorkil and his army destroys all the Hobbits and all the Dúnedain in the area, destroying the Four seats of power and conquering buildings like The Green Dragon Inn and Farmer Maggot's orchard. Soon after the seats of power are destroyed, Wormtongue and an army of Uruk-hai arrive to attack the Goblins and take the Shire for their own. He is killed by the Goblins, however, and the Uruk-hai break away in confusion and disarray. The Shire is now Gorkil's, and any Hobbits that survived the attack will be slain soon enough.\n\nIn Mission 4, Gorkil and his Goblin Army prepares to attack the mighty city of Fornost. The Dwarves of the Blue Mountains and most of the surviving Dúnedain are gathered here, and Gorkil prepares to destroy them and take the city for his own. After preparing his mighty army, Gorkil sends Cave-trolls and Mountain Giants to destroy both the main gates and postern gates hidden in the eastern part of the wall (assume that north is up, south is down, east is right, and west is left). Though many fall to the Dúnedain arrows and Dwarven Catapults, these structures are soon destroyed and the outer defenses crushed. With inner Fornost left, the Dwarves prepare a mighty Earth Hammer, but the Goblins invade and destroy this weapon of mass destruction before it activates. They then proceed to the Fornost Citadel, crushing it to pieces. The remaining defenders are all slain soon after, and the lands west of the Misty Mountains are now free for Sauron to control. Gorkil does not play an activate role again until Mission 8, the Fall of Rivendell.\n\nIn Mission 8, Gorkil arrives at the woods just outside of Rivendell. He has received word that Sauron has returned, that Frodo has fallen at Mount Doom, and that he must begin the assault on Rivendell. He brings him a mighty army to destroy the outer defenses of Rivendell. Glorfindel and several Rivendell Lancers ride out in an attempt to destroy the Goblins, but the Half-Troll Marauders and Gorkil's scorpion are more than a match, and all the elf riders (including Glorfindel) are slain. After capturing an outpost for extra resources, Gorkil and his army destroy the outer battle towers and Mirkwood Archers that guard Rivendell's front gate. With the help of many Mountain Giants, Rivendell's front gate is destroyed.\n\nAfter the gate is destroyed and the forces of Mordor (including Sauron) arrive, Gorkil gives control of the invasion to the Dark Lord and becomes one of his lieutenants. Combining his Goblin army with that of Mordor, the mighty armies lay waste to all of Rivendell, killing Elrond and Arwen in the process. While the attack is occurring, the Fellowship of the Ring (minus Sam and Frodo, who apparently fell at Mount Doom) arrives with the Army of the Dead, but the Dead soon disappear and all Fellowship members are slain. Sauron, Gorkil, and his fellow lieutenants (including Drogoth, Shelob, three Nazgûl, two Fell-Beast Riders, the Witch-king of Angmar, and the Mouth of Sauron) turn their attention back to Rivendell, and finish destroying the last remnants of Rivendell. Rivendell has fallen, and darkness now covers Middle-earth forever.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gorkil_the_Goblin_King"}}

He was also the tallest of the Elves of Gondolin.\n\nPengolodh escaped the sack of the city with Tuor and Idril's company of survivors, and followed them to the Mouths of Sirion. He is not further mentioned in writing, but since the Annals of Beleriand are attributed to him, as well as the edited Annals of Aman (furthering the work of Rúmil), he must have stayed in Lindon for at least a while after the War of Wrath, so that the Dúnedain could copy his work.\n\nIt was during his stay at the Mouths of Sirion that Pengolodh did the majority of his work. Basing on information obtained from the refugees of Doriath, he made copies and extracts of documents written in Cirth, possibly preserving them as an active writing system.\n\nLater, in the Second Age, he lived in the Ñoldorin kingdom of Gil-galad in Lindon. Pengolodh was one of the few Elves admitted into Khazad-dûm, where he might have learned Khuzdul. Pengolodh left Middle-earth during the War of the Elves and Sauron and after the fall of Eregion, and left for Tol Eressëa, last of the Loremasters to leave Middle-earth.

His lineage and influence left him in a position to challenge the current king, Eldacar, who was only half Dúnedain. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the legitimate heir to the throne, but his half Rhovanion lineage angered citizens who believed in a pure dúnedain royalty. Capitalizing on what became outright protest against the current king, Castamir was able to incite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the city Osgiliath in TA 1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops, destroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the city and into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the king, Castamir seized the throne.\n\nFor ten years Castamir ruled Gondor with an iron fist, while Eldacar quietly regained power. Castamir ruled cruelly, and committed many foul deeds, including executing Eldacar's own son, Ornendil. At first the people of Gondor tolerated Castamir because of his pure Númenórean blood. Then, in 1447, Castamir, now called \"the Usurper\" by his people was overthrown after a decade of wicked rule with the people now rallying around the true king, Eldacar. He was slain by Eldacar's forces at the Battle of Erui, the decisive battle of the Kin-strife as this period came to be known. At the Crossings of Erui, Eldacar personally slew Castamir.\n\nCastamir's influence did not end there. Remnants of his forces, and his surviving sons, retreated from the Battle of Erui to the port of Pelargir and escaped by ship to Umbar, far to the south. These descendants of Castamir became the so-called \"Corsairs of Umbar\", fierce pirates who terrorized the ports of Gondor with the help of the men of Harad. They were perhaps the greatest threat to Gondor for nearly 400 years, commanding massive fleets of ships. Their most infamous exploit was the Raid of Pelargir in TA 1634, in which a Corsair armada led by his great-grandsons Angamaitë\u200E and Sangahyando\u200E sailed up the river Anduin to the port of Pelargir, deep in Gondor's territory. This raid coincided with the young King Minardil's visit, and he was slain in by the Corsairs as they attacked.\n\nThey remained a significant threat until TA 1810, when King Telumehtar retook Umbar for Gondor. So great a victory was this, that forever after Telumehtar was known as Umbardacil, which literally means \"victor over Umbar\". In this battle the last descendants of Castamir were finally killed.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Castamir_the_Usurper"}}

When Melkor created the discord in the Music of the Ainur, the Second Theme of Eru that rose to counter the discord used Manwë as its chief instrument. When Arda was formed, Manwë was appointed Ruler of Arda, hence his most common title, the Elder King. Manwë was a kind, compassionate ruler, unconcerned with his own power. He oversaw all of the Valar's early attempts to order Arda, but was unable to stop Melkor's rampages until the Vala Tulkas came to Arda to assist his brethren.\n\nAfterwards, the Valar under Manwë made an abode on Middle-earth in the Isle of Almaren and constructed the two Lamps of the Valar to provide light to the world. But Melkor destroyed the lamps, and the Valar retreated to the continent of Aman, which they heavily fortified. Eventually, the Elves awoke in Middle-earth, and Manwë at last went with the other Valar to subdue Melkor. They succeeded, and Melkor was imprisoned in the Halls of Mandos. He extended an invitation to the Elves to journey to Aman and live there amongst the Valar. For the three Ages of Melkor's imprisonment, the Valar and the Elves lived in peace and happiness. But eventually Melkor was allowed to plead for pardon before Manwë again.\n\nAs Manwë was completely free of evil, he was unable to comprehend it, leading him to believe Melkor's lies concerning his reformation. He released Melkor from Mandos, whereupon Melkor began plotting the downfall of the Elves and the ruin of Aman's bliss. He began to cleverly spread lies amongst the Ñoldor, who soon grew to resent the Valar because of said lies. Eventually, due to the rebellious actions of the Noldor prince Fëanor, Melkor's lies were uncovered, but he escaped before he could be recaptured. Soon thereafter, Melkor recruited the great spider Ungoliant and poisoned the Two Trees. He then murdered the King of the Noldor, Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and incited Fëanor's leaving Aman with most of the Noldor in rebellion.\n\nSoon thereafter, Manwë learned that the rebellious Noldor had attacked and slaughtered many of the Teleri. As such, he forbade the Ñoldor from returning to Valinor once they left, and stated also that the Elves would receive no help from the Valar in their war against Morgoth. He then caused Valinor to be hidden by way of the Shadowy Seas and the Enchanted Isles to prevent the Ñoldor from returning.\n\nTo hearten the Eldar, he had Aulë fashion the Sun and the Moon, for he knew the rising of the Atani was coming soon, and sent Thorondor and the Eagles to watch them. After Morgoth's fall, Manwë cast him into the void. Manwë dresses in blue robes and has blue eyes. He wields a scepter of sapphire made for him by the Ñoldor.

Like many Dwarf lords it can be presumed that he was stout in body as he was in spirit, albeit quite greedy. This greed can be attributed, no doubt, to the effects of his ring of power which brooded a great lust for gold within their Dwarven bearers. This greed even lead to the spurning of King Thranduil, and the eventual souring of their relationship.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Thr%C3%B3r"}}

He was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, and was the only one of the dwarves to readily fight alongside elves in the war against Sauron at the end of the Third Age. After the defeat of Sauron, he was given lordship of the Glittering Caves at Helm's Deep.","In the books, Gimli uses one single axe. In Ralph Bakshi's ill-fated animation film, he follows the books description (The Lord of the Rings (Animated, 1978)), while in the trilogy by Peter Jackson, Gimli was known for his skill with the Axe, and during the War of the Ring he wielded five different types of axes.","During the Fellowship's travels through Moria, Gimli was able to retrieve a double bladed battle axe which apparently belonged to his father's cousin Balin, Lord of Moria, who had perished during the Goblin and Orc attack on Dwarrowdelf. Being double bladed, it allowed Gimli to swing it in both directions, without any need to constantly change the angle or grip. But it was much heavier, with a shorter staff, which meant it was more suited to close combat, but was compensated by its great striking power. He is never seen using it during the Return of the King film, as it remains pinned to his cloak. Gimli used all the axes mentioned above throughout the War of the Ring. He used them depending on the battlefield conditions and the types of enemies that he would have to face. No matter what axe, however, Gimli used them all with devastating power in every battle he faced, working in perfect conjunction with Aragorn's swordplay and Legolas's bow skill.","In addition to his melee weapons, Gimli utilized several throwing axes for his ranged attack. These axes, though obviously not the ones with the most range, could effectively kill whatever they were thrown at (with the exception of large, heavily armored enemies like trolls); however, he rarely uses them in the films. In the movies, Gimli threw an axe at the cave troll and at Gandalf in Fangorn Forest. He also throws one at an Uruk at beginning of the battle of Amon Hen. It is apparent that he prefers engaging in direct combat rather than using his throwing axes. Only on the PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube platforms of the Two Towers Gimli has 25 throwing axes and Gimli has 30 throwing axes in The Return of the King video game on the same above mentioned platforms as well as Mac and PC. This game also came out on the Gameboy Advance. Throwing axes however makes this function different in the Two Towers and The Return of the King on the Gameboy Advance it is available but to perform this function at the cost of certain points to do this certain ability. Though they can effectively damage\/kill enemies when charged, they are actually the weakest among Gimli's ranged attacks unlike the ranged attacks of Aragorn and Legolas. Still, they do have potency up to some extent.","In the Peter Jackson adaptation, Gimli accompanies his father, Gloin, and a deputation of Dwarves who have been summoned to the Council of Elrond to discuss the fate of the One Ring. In this adaptation, he attempts to destroy the ring by hitting it with his axe, but the axe breaks on the ring, which is itself unblemished by the encounter. He later volunteers to join the company at least in part because Legolas had just volunteered and he doubted the Elf's intentions. In the Peter Jackson adaptation, it was his idea to travel through the mines of Moria, though in the books it is Gandalf's. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)), (The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)), and (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003))","Gimli was shown as a bald-headed dwarf and was voiced by David Buck. (The Lord of the Rings (Animated, 1978))"],"name":"Gimli","description":"Gimli was the son of Glóin and a nephew of Óin, both former companions of Bilbo Baggins. He was a remote descendant of Durin the Deathless, father of the first house of dwarven people. Gimli stemmed from, but was not an inheritor of, the royal line. Through his father, Gimli was also the first cousin once removed (or \"nephew\", for simplicity's sake) of Balin, Lord of Moria, and his brother Dwalin, two more former companions of Bilbo. It is also stated in the Unfinished Tales that Gimli was prevented from traveling with his father on The Quest of Erebor because Thorin and company thought him too young, though Gimli, being in his sixties, considered himself ripe for adventure and was disappointed to be left behind.\n\nIn the year 3017 of the Third Age, an emissary from Mordor approached the King under the Mountain, Dáin II, with offers of friendship and requests for news of a Hobbit bearing a Ring. Not trusting the messenger, Dáin sent Glóin and Gimli to Rivendell to seek the advice of Elrond, and to have Bilbo warned that the Enemy was seeking him. As a result, they were summoned to the Council of Elrond, where Elrond believed they would find the answers to their questions and would be able to contribute. Whilst there, Gloin told Elrond of the messenger and made reference to Balin, who had entered Moria and attempted to reclaim it. However, he had not sent any word to King Dáin II for five years, and Gloin was concerned. The Council ultimately chose to send Frodo Baggins to Mordor to destroy the Ring, and decided that a small fellowship should go with him. Gimli volunteered to accompany the Fellowship to Mordor to destroy the One Ring.\n\nHe volunteered to join the company at least in part because Legolas had volunteered and he doubted the elf's intentions. Gimli journeyed with the fellowship southward along the Misty Mountains. However, the Fellowship was stymied in their attempt to traverse the pass of Caradhras, and were compelled to travel under the mountain rather than go over it. While none in the Fellowship were particularly keen on passing thorough Moria, Gimli at least was eager to learn what may have happened to Balin. Unfortunately, while in Moria, Gimli discovered Balin's tomb, as well as evidence that virtually all of the Dwarves who had attempted to retake Moria had been slain years prior. After Gandalf fell with Durin's Bane from the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, the Fellowship entered the Woods of Lothlórien, thus making Gimli the first dwarf to enter the Realm since the Balrog was awakened in Moria. However, there was some tension regarding Gimli's being in the Wood, and his Elven escorts wished to blindfold him for the journey. Gimli staunchly refused until Aragorn decided that all in the Fellowship should be blindfolded to make the Elven demand more equitable. While in Lorien, he accompanied Legolas on many walks through the wooded city, and the two became fast friends. When the fellowship departed, he was given a strand of Galadriel's hair, though when he asked for one, he was given three, which would lead to his name in later years of \"Lockbearer\", given to him by Galadriel. When the Fellowship of the Ring fractured, Gimli accompanied Aragorn and Legolas in pursuit of Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, who had been captured by the forces of Isengard.\n\nEventually the three were reunited with Gandalf, and became more involved with the war. Gimli played a critical role in the defeat of the forces of Isengard at Helms Deep, where he was separated from Aragorn and Legolas and driven into the caves which he would later become Lord of. He fought his way out alongside Eomer when the forces of Isengard were driven from Helm's Deep. His skill with an axe led to his winning, by one orc, the friendly contest he and Legolas held over who could kill the most Orcs, despite starting with a disadvantage. Gimli then accompanied Aragorn and Legolas through the Dimholt in an attempt to recruit the Army of the Dead. Upon freeing Gondor\u2019s soldiers and capturing the Corsair's ships, the forces under Aragorn, including Gimli, sailed to Minas Tirith. After being victorious at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Gimli accompanied Aragorn and the remainder of the Gondor and Rohan armies to the Black gates.\n\nAfter the War, Gimli led a large number of Durin's Folk south to establish a new Dwarf kingdom in the Glittering Caves, which were located behind Helm's Deep where Gimli was trapped during the battle, and he became the first Lord of the Glittering Caves. The Dwarves of the Glittering Caves, led by their Lord Gimli, would repair much of the physical damage that was incurred during the War of the Ring. Most notably, they rebuilt the Great Gate of Minas Tirith with a new one made of Mithril and steel, as well as improving upon the existing layout of the entire city.\n\nGimli was 139 years old (born in 2879 of the Third Age) when the Fellowship of the Ring set out from Rivendell, making him 52 years older than Aragorn. His date of death is not known, and according to the Red Book of Westmarch, he is said to have traveled with Legolas into the West, thus becoming the first dwarf to visit the Undying Lands. Of this possibility, Tolkien wrote that it would be strange indeed, that any Dwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the Eldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit it, but that it is said that Gimli went not only because of his great friendship with Legolas, but also out of desire to see again the beauty of Galadriel; and that she, being mighty among the Eldar, may have obtained this grace for him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gimli"}}

He was a man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion, and the most accomplished hero and adventurer of the First Age. The battle of the Dagor Bragollach befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin of his kingdom. The young Beren lived with his father and eleven loyal followers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the thirteen of them performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the Dark King of Angband. After the ruin of the Outlaws of Dorthonion and the death of his father, Beren lived alone in Dorthonion off the land and came to know the many birds and beasts that lived there, and they helped him when he needed it. During this time, he hunted nothing and ate no meat and only killed the creatures of Morgoth that roamed the country. He learned not to fear death only captivity and bondage; however, things began grow more difficult for him in Dorthonion for Morgoth put an even greater price on his head and he was forced from the land of his birth by Sauron and Draugluin. He crossed into Doriath, through the forests of Dungortheb, where he saw and fell in love with Lúthien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian.\n\nThingol haughtily refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage. He said that he would allow the marriage to take place only if Beren brought back a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. The task was intended to be impossible, but Beren and Lúthien, with the aid of Finrod of Nargothrond and Huan the Great Hound (both of whom died protecting Beren), braved many perils (even besting Sauron, then Morgoth's most powerful lieutenant) and captured a Silmaril. However, as they escaped from Angband, the great wolf Carcharoth, whom Morgoth had personally bred, awoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert the beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand swallowed it and the Silmaril (thus Beren was called Erchamion, One-hand), and proceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Lúthien and the unconscious Beren were rescued by the Eagles of Manwë. When he presented himself to Thingol, he demonstrated to him that he had obtained, then lost the Silmaril at the cost of one of his hands; he was then given the name Camlost, Empty-handed. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth, where the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was accomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.\n\nLúthien's love for Beren was so strong that, upon hearing of his death, she lay down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of Mandos, where she managed to charm Mandos into granting her a wish. Both she and Beren were miraculously restored to life, but both of them would live as mortals and die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of Arda to a place unknown. Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol Galen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed apart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the First Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of dwarves who had destroyed Doriath and stolen the Nauglamír (and the Silmaril with it).\n\nLúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be one of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of men, of elves, and of the Ainur. Through his descendants, the blood of Beren and of Lúthien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain.\n\nBeren's deeds inspired all the peoples opposing Morgoth to unite themselves into a greater force to vanquish his power resulting in the valiant but doomed Union of Maedhros. His romance and love for Lúthien Tinúviel and what he was willing to do to ensure it helped foster greater respect for men amongst the elves. He was also the first to mix the blood of elves and men with each other and this bloodline continued, siring the Númenórean nobility and the Dúnedain alike on up to Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Beren"}}

His eyes burned like red coals and his teeth were poisoned as the spears of the Orcish legions. Carcharoth was the guardian of the gate of Angband and none could pass him by strength of body alone.\n\nHe became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril when Beren and Lúthien had to pass him on their way in. He espied them on their way in, and grew suspicious of Beren because he was disguised as Draugluin, who Carcharoth knew to be slain. Before he could take action against the pair, Lúthien enchanted him with her magic, sending him into a deep sleep. Unfortunately, on their way out Carcharoth awoke, and Lúthien was too weary to spell him again. Beren held out the captured Silmaril in an attempt to stay the beast, but Carcharoth was not daunted, and bit off Beren's hand at the wrist, Silmaril and all.\n\nThe Silmaril burnt away Carcharoth's insides, and he became crazed with pain, yet filled with great power. A terror to Eldar, Men and Orcs alike, he burst from Angband, slaying anything and everything in his path. He continued south through Beleriand, and eventually he arrived in Doriath. With the power of the Silmaril inside him, the Girdle of Melian had no effect on him, and his presence placed the entire kingdom in grave danger. To protect Doriath, Beren Erchamion, Elu Thingol, Beleg Cúthalion, and Mablung joined with Huan the Hound to track down and slay the Wolf.\n\nCarcharoth was killed in single combat by Huan in FA 466, but both Huan and Beren were mortally wounded by the poison in Carcharoth's teeth.

Once a Númenórean king of men, he was corrupted by one of the nine Rings of Power that had been given to the lords of men, and became an undead wraith in the service of Sauron.  ","As a Nazgûl, the Witch-king had a wide arsenal of powers. He was surrounded by an aura of fear, enough to make trained soldiers run in terror. Besides the common Black Breath, any weapon that struck the Witch-king would be destroyed (a fate shared by Meriadoc Brandybuck's and Éowyn's swords), and its bearer would be poisoned. This was so severe that it was worse than a blow from his mace.","In The Fellowship of the Ring, the Witch-king appears unnamed as one of the nine Nazgûl. He appears briefly as a king of men in the prologue, and serves as one of the primary antagonists throughout the film alongside the other Ringwraiths. The Ringwraith who stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade on Weathertop is the Witch-king, although this is only revealed in The Return of the King by Gandalf.","The Witch-king also appears in the The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, briefly fighting Radagast. The Witch-king's portrayal in the film is also different from in the books. In the film he is said to have been killed after the fall of Angmar and buried prior to his revival by the Necromancer. In the books, however, the Witch-king does not die following the fall of Angmar, and instead goes to Dol Guldur. In The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, he, along with the other Ringwraiths, fight the White Council in Dol Guldur. After being defeated, they flee to Mordor with Sauron.","It would appear based on much of Angmar's powers that the Witch-king's original sorcery was based on ice, cold, and the dead. In the Battle for Middle-earth games, the Witch-king is noted for being extremely cruel, as he will attack friend and foe alike. The only two other units in the franchise that show this savagery are the Balrog and the Spectral Werewolf, as not even Sauron kills his underlings for being in the way. He also has the largest health pool for a standard hero, at 8,000 health points at the start, but has very little to any armor.","Although not officially named in The Lord of the Rings books, those who preordered The Lord of the Rings: Conquest video game were given a replica of the Witch-king's sword. On the box art (and playing as the Witch-king in the game), EA provides a name for the weapon: The Sword of Terror.","In the movies, the Witch-king uses a flail instead of a mace. Although the choice of weapon was different, it is a relatively minor change as both mace and flail are similar in nature, and used with equal power in the hands of the Lord of the Nazgûl.","The Witch-king's last and smallest weapon was, in a way, more powerful than any of his primaries. That was a Morgul-blade, a deadly sorcerer's device that could turn any it stabbed into a lesser wraith, slave to the true Nine and Sauron. A Morgul-blade was reserved for the most powerful enemies of the Dark Lord, or for special purposes. He used it on Frodo, in an attempt to claim the Ring and punish its bearer by putting him in a state worse than death. Fortunately, though, the blade failed to complete its task. Nevertheless, a Morgul-blade is a powerful tool of destruction, with one of the most powerful curses imaginable upon it.","Besides weapons actually crafted from forges in Mordor, the Witch-king also used his winged Fell beast as a method of attacking his enemies. This Fell Beast served two purposes: to take down enemy structures and catapults and to kill massive amounts of enemies at once. When the Witch-king (or indeed, any other Ringwraith) swooped down upon his enemies, they would flee in terror and attempt to save themselves (usually unsuccessfully). This Fell Beast was finally slain by Éowyn via decapitation.","Though no character in the story uses the title Witch-king of Angmar, Tolkien does use the title in full in Appendix B, in the entry for the year 1409 of the Third Age.","An undead \"witch-king\" named Þráinn appears in Hrómundar saga Gripssonar. It is probable that this was Tolkien's source of inspiration. Although, another witch-king appears in Greek mythology, and is named Aeetes. What should be noted is that Aeetes' appearance bears more resemblance to the one of Angmar."],"name":"Witch-king of Angmar","description":"The first sighting of the Nazgûl in Middle-earth was reported in SA 2251. For the next 1200 years, the Lord of the Nazgûl would serve Sauron as his second in command. He fought in the war against the Last Alliance of Elves and Men between SA 3434 and SA 3441. It was in SA 3441 when Sauron was finally defeated and the nine Nazgûl disappeared from Middle-earth.\n\nOne thousand years into the Third Age, Sauron took a new form as the Necromancer, and founded the fortress of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood in TA 1050. This signaled the return of the Nine Nazgûl to Middle-earth.\n\nThe Lord of the Nazgûl reappeared in TA 1300 in the north near the lost realm of Arnor. There he founded the kingdom of Angmar. It was after the formation of Angmar and several conflicts with the Dúnedain of the North that the Lord of the Nazgûl received the title of \"Witch-king, Lord of Angmar\".\n\nHe then began his open war campaign with the three divided kingdoms of Arnor (Arthedain, Rhudaur, and Cardolan). In TA 1356, the Witch-king invaded the kingdom of Rhudaur and replaced the Dúnedain king of the land with a hill-chief allied to Angmar. King Argeleb of Arthedain was killed trying to defend Rhudaur against Angmar. In TA 1409 the troops of the Witch-king assaulted the fortress of Amon Sûl and burned the tower, during which conflict king Arveleg of Arthedain was killed. The Witch-king then invaded and destroyed the kingdom of Cardolan. Then the Witch-king invaded Arthedain and came close to destroying it but King Araphor with the help of the elves of Lindon and Rivendell managed to defeat the invading forces.\n\nSoon, the only resistance against the Witch-king's forces was the western kingdom of Arthedain. The Witch-king continued his war for hundreds of years. In TA 1636, the Witch-king sent wights to the Barrow-downs in Cardolan in order to prevent the rebirth of the kingdom. The Witch-king claimed ultimate victory in the north in TA 1974, when his forces captured Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain. With its capture, the final kingdom collapsed, and with it, the last remnants of the lost realm of Arnor were destroyed.\n\nThe Witch-king gladly took his seat of power in the newly captured Fornost. But his glory did not last long, for in TA 1975, general Eärnur of Gondor landed at the harbours of the Grey Havens, leading an army of Gondor. His army was joined by the Elves of Lindon and the remnant of the northern Dúnedain, and they marched on the Witch-king.\n\nEärnur's host did not meet the Witch-king at Fornost, but on the plains west of it toward Lake Evendim, home of the ancient kings of Arnor, Annúminas. The battle would forever be known as the Battle of Fornost. Eärnur's Dúnedain army was later joined in the mists of battle by Glorfindel and his Elven army from Rivendell. The Witch-king revealed himself and challenged Eärnur. As Eärnur attempted to attack, his horse was overwhelmed with fear of the Nazgûl lord and bucked. The Witch-king, taunting Eärnur, fled the battlefield. When Eärnur attempted to follow, Glorfindel stopped him with a warning that would become prophetic in the future:\n\nThe Witch-king, having destroyed the North-kingdom, fled the North. Angmar was left leaderless and soon collapsed.\n\nHaving ruined the Dunedain kingdoms in Eriador, the Witch-king returned to Mordor. Although Sauron was still hiding in Dol Guldur (disguised as the Necromancer), the other eight Nazgûl rallied around the Witch-king. Together, the nine of them laboured to rebuild their master's power in Mordor, gathering huge Orcish hordes about themselves. In the year TA 2000 they came out of Mordor and began attacking Gondor, which was recovered from the Great Plague but devastated by the Wainriders. In TA 2002 they captured Minas Ithil, and took the place for their own. It became known as Minas Morgul and its citadel \"the Tower of Witchcraft\", and remained a place of great evil for centuries thereafter.\n\nIn TA 2043, King Eärnil II of Gondor passed away and his son Eärnur, the Witch-king's old enemy, inherited the throne. Upon his coronation, the Witch-king challenged him to single combat, but Eärnur refused. However, seven years later in TA 2050 the Witch-king again challenged him\u2014and Eärnur accepted. The Gondorian King rode out of Minas Tirith to fight the Witch-king at Minas Morgul. He entered the city's gates and was never seen again, thus ending the reign of the Gondorian Kings and beginning the rule of the Stewards of Gondor. In TA 2063 the Watchful Peace began when Sauron fled Dol Guldur and hid in the East, and the Nazgûl remained quiet in Minas Morgul for the next 400 years.  In TA 2460, the Watchful Peace ended when Sauron, disguised as the Necromancer, returned with increased strength to Dol Guldur, and in TA 2475 the Witch-king led hordes of Orcs and Haradrim against Osgiliath and seized its eastern half. The city was ruined, and the great stone bridge linking the east and west banks of the Anduin river was destroyed, dealing a devastating blow to the morale of Gondor.\n\nIn TA 2941 the Necromancer was finally expelled from Dol Guldur when Gandalf confirmed that he truly was Sauron in disguise. Sauron returned to Mordor and began preparations to find his One Ring. He began the reconstruction of Barad-dûr in TA 2951 and sent three Ringwraiths to re-capture Dol Guldur. And in TA 3018, with the capture of Gollum, Sauron learned, through torture, where the land of the Hobbits lay. Unfortunately, Gollum had lied, and the Ringwraiths went to Saruman, who refused to tell them the location of the land of the Halflings. The Witch King chanced upon Grima Wormtongue in Rohan, who, for fear of his life, told the Nazgûl where the Shire was. Sauron opened the gates of Minas Morgul and sent forth the Witch-king and the other Nazgûl disguised as Black Riders to fetch his Ring.\n\nWith an attack on Osgiliath that was in fact a ruse, the Nazgûl and army of Orcs were able to cross the river and ride west.\n\nThe Witch-king and the other eight Nazgûl rode swiftly from Mordor to the lands of the Shire. They continued to search for \"Baggins\" until they tracked him to Buckland. The Nine Riders raided Buckland but could not find the Ring.\n\nThe Witch-king led four other Nazgûl to Weathertop where they discovered Frodo, Aragorn, and the other hobbits. The Ringwraiths attacked the party and the Witch-king wounded Frodo with a Morgul blade. Though successfully driven off by Aragorn, Frodo's wound threatened to turn him into a wraith like the Nazgûl. Elrond of Rivendell sent Glorfindel to guide Frodo to Rivendell where Elrond could heal his wound. Glorfindel's race to Rivendell lured the Ringwraiths into the Bruinen. Here, Elrond released a Great Flood, with Gandalf giving the waves of the torrent the form of horses. This flood destroyed the physical forms of the Ringwraiths, killed their horses, and sent the Wraiths back to their master in Mordor, buying the Fellowship time to plan an attack.\n\nWith their return to Mordor, Sauron bestowed upon the Nazgûl great winged creatures as their new mounts. Sauron used the lesser eight Nazgûl for reconnaissance work and the occasional shock troop. The Witch-king, however, returned to Minas Morgul and resumed the role of commander of Sauron's forces. He then began battles to capture Osgiliath, finally issuing from Morgul with a great host. However, at the bridge over Morgulduin he pauses, feeling the Ring nearby; until Frodo touches the Phial and turns aside his enemy's thought.\n\nThe final Battle of Osgiliath was fought on March 13, 3019 of the Third Age against Faramir's rangers. Faramir's forces could not hold the Orc hordes under the control of Gothmog. Faramir pulled his forces back to Minas Tirith assailed by flying Nazgûl, losing much of his force in the retreat. A second time he went forth, and from that assault only Faramir returned to Minas Tirith, gravely wounded, in Gandalf's arms. With Gondor's defeat at Osgiliath, nothing stood in the way of Sauron's ambitions of destroying Minas Tirith and the Free People's hopes.  On March 14, Orcs, Haradrim, and Easterling forces numbering over 200,000 marched on the gates of Minas Tirith. Sauron had bestowed the Witch-king with newfound strength, making his appears on a black horse, his presence casting a shadow of utter paralysis and fear upon defender and foe. Crying incantations in \"some forgotten tongue,\" he enhances the power of Grond, and weakens the already damaged gate of Minas Tirith. The ram breaks open the gate, and the defenders inside flee, terror stricken by his dark presence. However, his march in is hindered by Gandalf the White, the only one able to withstand his power. There is a duel of words between them, and the Witch-king doffs his hood revealing a crown on empty air, mocking Gandalf as \"old fool\" and bidding him die, threateningly draws his blade, which blazes on its own accord. Gandalf holds firm, ready to do battle, but before they can clash the horns of Rohan sound, signaling the arrival of aid to Minas Tirith. The Witch-king then withdraws to order the defence against this new threat.\n\nThe Witch-king mounted his Fell beast and rallied his troops against the furious charge of the Rohirrim. The army of Rohan was slowed the initial charge blunted by their encounter with the Mumakil, allowing the hosts of Mordor to re-organize. The Witch-king took this opportunity to strike down King Théoden while his troops were in confusion. Flying on the back of his fell beast, he drove upon Théoden. The advancing Rohirrim horses panicked as his beast attacked. Théoden's horse, Snowmane, became frightened, was struck by a black dart and fell upon its master.\n\nAs the Witch-king hovered over Théoden on his fell beast, Éowyn and the hobbit Merry stood in his way.\n\nÉowyn slew his fell beast with a single stroke of her sword, severing its neck. The Witch-king arose, and with a cry of hatred he shattered her shield and broke her left arm with a single blow of his mace. But as he towered over her, preparing to deliver the final blow, Merry stabbed his sword from behind into the sinew of the Witch-king's knee. While the Witch-king was distracted, Éowyn drove her sword where the head of the wraith would have been, slaying him.\n\nThe prophesy of Glorfindel so many centuries before had thus come to pass. For not by the hand of [a] man had he failed, but by those of a hobbit and a woman. Now, with his death, the tide of the battle had changed, and ultimately the outcome of the War. No more than ten days later, Sauron himself was finally defeated when the One Ring was cast back into the fires of Mount Doom and unmade.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Witch-king_of_Angmar"}}

He is a playable hero for Angmar in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king. He was slain during the final assault on Angmar."],"name":"Rogash","description":"When the Witch-king of Angmar arrived, Rogash was fighting a group of Black Númenórean infantry. The Witch-king and Morgomir helped him to kill the Black Númenóreans. Rogash explained to the Witch King that he wanted to unite the Snow Trolls, Hill Trolls and Dire wolves to steal gold and meat from the men of Arnor. The Witch-king told Rogash that if he wanted to unite all trolls, he would have to serve him. They advanced to the Hill of Snow Trolls where they found a group of Trolls fighting against each other, Rogash stopped the battle and the Witch King asked them to join him against the Black Númenóreans. They agreed to join and killed the all the Black Númenóreans that lived close to their hill. After moving north they found some trolls working as slaves and so freed them and built three fortresses to hold against the Black Númenórean's. After going south Rogash found a group of Cave Trolls and united them to his casue. Since the Black Númenóreans were launching a counterattack, the Witch King and Rogash fled to their southern fortress and defeated the Black Númenóreans when they arrived.\n\nThe new king Arveleg had finally defeated Angmar after so many attacks. That he had foreseen with the Palantír of Amon Sûl. The Witch King attacked Amon Sûl with all his forces and had sent a diversion attack to Rivendell and Cardolan. Rogash easily breached their shield walls by jumping over the soldiers. Reinforcements arrived to help the Dunedain. However some Mountain Giants were sent to reinforce the Witch-king. All the Maiar that were allowed Amon Sûl magic powers were destroyed and Morgomir destroyed the tower with his powers. Arveleg fled from the fortress with the Palantír. Morgomir had gone in and persuaded Arveleg. It is unknown if any Dunedian survived or escaped.\n\nThe Witch-king attacked the Barrow Downs knowing that Cardolan would foolishly attack his forces. First he sends Hwaldar, who defeated the initial attacks then Rogash and his Troll Army arrived to destroy the vanguard of Cardolan. Even if the vanguard was made of elite soldiers Rogash and his Trolls where too strong for them. At last the Prince arrived to the Barrow Downs at the same time that the Witch-king with the main army arrived. The Royal Guard of Cardolan was too strong and many Trolls died, but Rogash slew a good number of them. The Witch-king killed the prince in a single duel, and Cardolan was defeated, leaving only Fornost, in the region Arthedain, as the last fortress in Arnor.\n\nThe attack on Rivendell united all the Elven realms against Angmar. The Elves of Lindon, Rivendell and Lorien lead by Glorfindel and Elrond march against Carn Dûm. Rogash and Morgomir waited for the signal of the Witch King to arrive with reinforcements. The Witch-king light the signal and Morgomir and Rogash began moving but they arrived too late the citadel was besieged by the Elves but there was still time to save Angmar while Rogash and his army attacked from the back the Elven army the gates opened and the forces of Carn Dûm attacked from the front. Rogash's arrival saved Angmar from total destruction.\n\nAfter the Great Plague had weakened Arnor, the Witch-king decides to attack Fornost and have absolute victory over Arnor. All his armies were there to ruin the city. After the main gate of Fornost was destroyed the Shade of the Wolf was summoned. Hobbits of the Shire and of Bree arrived to help Arnor. Rogash with some Trolls and Karsh killed them all. The Troll army came separated from the main army and destroyed the Northwestern parts of the city. They enter the citadel by its western gate where they met with the main army. They took down the monuments of Gondor, which gave them victory.\n\nWhen Elrond, Glorfindel and Eärnur finally attacked Angmar, Rogash and an army of Trolls waited for them in the Hills of the Snow Trolls. When the army arrived and Earnur challenged Rogash, many Elves and Men fell under the mighty sword of Rogash until Earnur fought against him and killed him. All of his Trolls died and the Witch-king was defeated. That was then the end of the Reign of Angmar, and Carn-dûm was destroyed.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rogash"}}

Bard himself fired many arrows with his great yew bow. He was down to his last arrow when a thrush came and perched on his shoulder. Because Bard was of the race of Dale, he was able to understand the thrush's words. The bird told him of the weak spot in Smaug's armor that Bilbo Baggins had discovered. Bard fired his Black Arrow and struck the hollow by Smaug's left breast and the dragon fell from the sky, landing on Laketown and destroying it.\n\nBard escaped into the lake and swam ashore. The people wanted him to be their King, but he said he would continue to serve the Master of Laketown for the time being. Bard took charge of organizing shelter and aid for the refugees and sent messages to the Elvenking of Mirkwood asking for help. Then, Bard and the Elvenking led their armies to the Lonely Mountain, seeking a share of the treasure.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, they were surprised to find Thorin Oakenshield and his company of Dwarves still alive. Bard sought reparations from Thorin on the grounds that it was he who had slain Smaug, that part of the Dragon\u2019s treasure had once belonged to Dale, and that the people of Laketown were suffering and needed aid. Thorin said that the destruction of Laketown was not his responsibility and he refused to parley with armies camped outside the mountain. Bard sent a messenger several hours later asking for one-twelfth of the treasure, but again Thorin refused.\n\nBilbo Baggins thought that Bard's claims were reasonable, so one night he went secretly to the camp of the Lakemen and Elves. The Hobbit had found the Arkenstone - the treasure that Thorin most desired - and he offered it to Bard and Thranduil to use to negotiate. He also told them that an army of 500 Dwarves led by Dain II Ironfoot was coming from the Iron Hills.\n\nThe next day, Bard asked Thorin for a portion of the treasure in exchange for the Arkenstone. Thorin was enraged, but he reluctantly agreed to give up Bilbo's one-fourteenth share. Dain's army arrived the next day, and Bard tried to prevent them from entering the Lonely Mountain until the exchange for the Arkenstone had been made. A battle seemed imminent, but then Gandalf told them that an army of Goblins and Wargs were approaching. Bard, Thranduil, and Dain took council together and they joined forces to fight their common enemy in the Battle of the Five Armies. During the battle, Thorin had emerged from mountain and had rallied Dwarves, Elves, and Men to the attack, but he was mortally wounded. Bard laid the Arkenstone upon Thorin's breast when he was buried under the mountain, and Dain agreed to pay the one-fourteenth share of the treasure as promised. Bard gave the emeralds of Girion to Thranduil and Bilbo agreed to take a small chest of gold and one of silver. Bard also contributed gold for the aid of Laketown, and although the Master of Laketown absconded with much of it, Laketown was rebuilt and its people became prosperous.\n\nBard went to his ancestral home of Dale at the foot of the Lonely Mountain. He rebuilt the ruined town and in TA 2944, he became King of Dale. Bard maintained good relations with the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain and trade flowed freely up and down the River Running.

This was when they attacked the mountain and took it from the Dwarves. In the Third Age, the Orcs of Angmar officially stated Gundabad as their capital, which angered the Dwarves greatly.   Gundabad remained an Orc stronghold, until it was cleared of orcs in TA 2799, after the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. However, small groups of orcs must have returned and fortified it anew during the events of The Hobbit, menacing Wilderland once again. It was from here that the Goblins present at the Battle of Five Armies came from in their marching numbers. Their leader, Bolg, son of Azog, was the supreme commander of the orcs from Mount Gundabad and presumably the northern Misty Mountains, and was killed by Beorn, the skin-changer. It is unknown what became of the orcs after that or who their leader was, but they eventually became a threat again. In battle, they were armed with orcish scitimars, spears and axes.\n\nIn The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Azog is from Mount Gundabad. Azog led legions of Gundabad Orcs to Moria.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the Gundabad Orcs had appearance similar to that of the Orcs of Mordor, the footsoldiers of the Dark Lord Sauron. They had dark skin, fangs, claws, and a small amount of hair. They wore armor of brown and white fur coats threaded with various beast's teeth and wooden shields bearing the Eye of Sauron. They, like many orcs, used long scimitars with which they impaled and slashed their victims.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gundabad_Orcs"}}

After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin\n\nLater in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.\n\nDwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party began at Bilbo's hobbit hole. He was wearing a dark-green hood and walked in as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli and Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself. Dwalin lent a green hood and cloak to Bilbo when they set out on their journey.\n\nAfter reclaiming the mountain from Smaug, Dwalin fought in the Battle of Five Armies and was one of those that survived the terrible battle. He later received his fourteenth share and chose to live in Erebor under the rule of Dáin II Ironfoot, Thorin's cousin.\n\nDwalin was one of seven of the ten Dwarves of Thorin's company who were still living in Erebor when Frodo came to Rivendell, as reported by Glóin. After the War of the Ring was over, resulting the defeat of Sauron and the destruction of the One Ring, Dwalin lived throughout his life in the Fourth Age in Middle-earth and passed away in FO 91 at the age of 340, considered later than any other known date of death for others of the company.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dwalin"}}

Her primary weapons are a reflex bow and two long daggers. She is shown to be an adept archer and marksman, with elvish reflexes and accuracy. She can simultaneously wield her bow and knife in combat, and can fire an arrow quick enough to intervene with the passage of a slower Orc arrow. She is also shown to possess some medical knowledge, being able to treat wounds from poisoned weapons. As a native of the Woodland Realm, she is also a capable tree climber.\n\nEvangeline Lilly, who plays Tauriel in the movie, expressed some trepidation at the reaction of Tolkien purists to a character that does not appear in Tolkien's written works, but stated that for her, creating the character for the adaptation was justified: \"I believe she is authentic, because Tolkien refers to The Woodland Elves, he just doesn't talk about who they are specifically\u2026 [Peter and Fran] know that world so well.

Almost immediately after the death of Náin, Dáin rushed up the steps and slew Azog himself, thus avenging his father's death. He was a very young Dwarf at the time, being only thirty-two years of age, by the Dwarves reckoning, he was still a stripling. Dáin's feat was heralded as a magnificent and glorious triumph for one so young. Dáin alone looked past the gate into Moria, and had the wisdom to know that it was impossible for the dwarves to return at that time. His kingdom at the Iron Hills was so great that they were the only people truly capable of dealing with Sauron's forces at that time.\n\nDáin was the friend and cousin of Thorin Oakenshield, and responded to Thorin's call for help during the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Dáin marched with five hundred Dwarven soldiers, exceptionally strong even by Dwarven standards, clad in heavy armor and iron boots, and armed with mattocks, shields, and broadswords. He arrived just in time for the Battle of the Five Armies. After the battle, Dain thanked the Eagles for their timely intervention, crowning their chief with gold and swearing the dwarves to everlasting friendship with them. He also honored Thorin's committments to Bard the Bowman and Bilbo Baggins, giving a fourteenth share of the Mountain's treasure to the people of Lake-town, and promising an even greater share to Bilbo, who politely declined to take more than two small chests, filled with silver and gold. Dain also restored the emeralds of Girion to King Thranduil, who prized them greatly.\n\nAfter Thorin's death, Dáin became King under the Mountain and King of Durin's folk, the first not to be in a direct line. Dáin was a wise and just leader, and brought much wealth to the mountain realm and was on good terms with the Men of Dale in the south and the Elven king of Northern Mirkwood as well, which ensured peace for many years to come. When Balin and other dwarves decided to reclaim Moria, Dáin initially refused, but Balin insisted on going.\n A few months before the Council of Elrond, a messenger from Mordor appeared at the entrance of the Lonely Mountain and offered the Dwarves an alliance with Sauron, asking only in return that the Dwarves share what they knew \"concerning Hobbits\", and help to track down the One Ring, which the messenger described as \"least of rings... a trifle that Sauron fancies.\"  The messenger said that, if the Dwarves could deliver the Ring itself, then Sauron would return three of the Rings of Power that originally belonged to the Dwarf-Lords, and Moria would be theirs to possess forever.  On the other hand, the messenger warned that \"things will not seem so well\" if the Dwarves did not help.\n\nSuspicious and apparently recognizing old enemies such as Orcs, Dain refused to be bribed or blackmailed, and sent the messenger away without an answer, and instead sent Glóin to Rivendell, to consult with Elrond, while Dáin prepared the Lonely Mountain for war.\n\nDáin participated in the War of the Ring's northern campaign but was killed during the Battle of Dale in TA 3019, defending the body of King Brand of Dale before the gates of the Lonely Mountain. He was, by then, an extremely old Dwarf, at the age of two-hundred and fifty-two, but still strong for his age. He was still among the greatest of the Dwarven warriors, a direct descendant of Durin and his prowess in battle was nearly unmatched.\n\nAfter news of his death reached Minas Tirith, Gandalf remarked that, as saddened as they must be at Dáin's death, they should be glad that he died in battle, defending his friend's body, as well as amazed that he was still as formidable a warrior as he had been when he was a young dwarf:\n\nAfter his death during the war, his son, Thorin III Stonehelm, succeeded him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/D%C3%A1in_II_Ironfoot"}}

The eyes of Arien were said to be too bright for even the Eldar to look upon. In the Years of the Trees, Arien tended to the golden flower gardens of Vána where Arien would water the flowers with great bright dews collected from the great golden Tree Laurelin. Later, Arien was chosen by the Valar to carry the vessel of the Sun because she was the only one who was not afraid and could bear the heats of the great Tree Laurelin and so was unhurt by it. While in Valinor , Arien took a physical form similar to that of the Valar; but when Arien left Valinor, she forsook her raiment and became a \"naked flame of fire, terrible in the fullness of her splendour\".\n\nLater on, when the great Two Trees of Valinor were destroyed by Morgoth  and Ungoliant, the golden Tree Laurelin managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. Subsequently Aulë, the Greatest Craftmans of the Earth, then created a vessel to hold the last golden fruit of Laurelin. However the Maia Tilion, chosen to steer the vessel of the Moon, had traversed seven times before the vessel of the Sun was ready. So after the vessel for the Sun  also named 'Anar' was at last made ready, Arien carried the vessel of the Sun away up into the Heavens giving light to the World. Hence, Anar rose in glory and the first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the Pelóri Mountains in Aman. And the clouds of Middle-earth was kindled and there was heard the sound of many waterfalls. Then indeed Morgoth was dismayed and he descended to the lowest pits of Angband and also withdrew all his servants as well. There, Morgoth sent forth great reeks and darkness of clouds to hide his land from the the light of the Daystar. For of Arien, Morgoth feared with a great fear and dared not come close to her having indeed no power to do so now.\n\nIt has been told that Arien was more powerful than Tilion who was drawn to Arien and occasionally followed Arien through the night sky but when catching up to her, the Island of the Moon became burned and blackened by Arien's heat when in close proximity to her. Moreover, the Valar stored the great radiance of the Sun in many vessels, vats, and pools to use for their comfort in times of darkness. As Arien was the \"Guardian of the Sun\", she was one of the most loved of the Maiar by mortal Men for her first journey across the sky was the signal of the  Awakening of Men.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Arien"}}

This is not a reasonable possibility. Mordor was extremely well guarded and Sauron had many spies. Attempting this would have resulted in the ring being delivered into the hands of Sauron. It has nothing to do with how high the Eagles could fly (their Aeries were on the Peaks of the Misty Mountains, which were between 5,000 and 8,000 meters in height), or their willingness to take anyone (as noted in Book 6, Chapter 4 of The Lord of the Rings: The field of Cormallen, when Gwaihir says to Gandalf in response to his request to rescue Frodo: 'I would bear you,\" answered Gwahir 'whither you wished even if you were made of stone.' (it should be pointed out that prior references to \"tidings\" vs \"burdens\" use the term \"bear,\" which derives from the Old English Barun, meaning \"to carry a heavy burden\" - Gwaihir at that point was referring not to his unwillingness to carry Gandalf, or his inability to fly with him on his back), but simply due to the fact it is a bad idea. In addition to Mordor being well guarded. The One Ring must be dropped, not into Mount Doom itself, but into the Cracks of Doom. An Eagle flying towards Mordor could have tipped Sauron to this plan, where he would have ordered the Cracks of Doom sealed, and waited outside it on the slopes of Mount Doom with an army of a half million Orcs, tens of thousands of Easterlings, Haradrim, and Black Númenóreans, and nine Nazgûl awaiting the arrival of his precious ring."],"name":"Gwaihir","description":"Gwaihir was descended from Thorondor, the greatest Eagle who ever lived. It was said that he and his brother Landroval aided Thorondor in rescuing Beren and Luthien from Angband.\n\nAt some point in his life, Gandalf the Grey saved him from a poisoned arrow.\n\nIn the summer of TA 3018, Gandalf asked Radagast the Brown to send word among his friends the birds to learn what they could of the Enemy's plans. The Great Eagles flew far and wide and gathered news of the Nazgûl and the mustering of Orcs and Wargs, and of the escape of Gollum from Mirkwood.\n\nGwaihir went to Isengard to bring this news to Gandalf. In the early hours of September 18, he found Gandalf imprisoned by Saruman on the pinnacle of Orthanc. Gwaihir bore Gandalf away, and when the Wizard said that he needed a horse, Gwaihir set him down in the land of Rohan.\n\nOn February 17, 3019, Gwaihir was searching for Gandalf at the request of Galadriel when he found the Wizard atop the Silvertine. Gandalf had vanquished the Balrog in the Battle of the Peak, but the entrance to the Endless Stair had been blocked and he had been unable to escape from the mountaintop. Gwaihir once again bore Gandalf and he found his burden to be as light as a feather, for Gandalf's old life had been burned away and he had been reborn as Gandalf the White.\n\nThe Eagle brought Gandalf to Lothlórien and then at the Wizard's request he flew to seek news of the Fellowship. Aragorn and Legolas both saw him circling above the Emyn Muil. Gwaihir returned to Gandalf with the news that Merry and Pippin had been captured by Saruman's Uruk-hai.\n\nGwaihir and his brother Landroval led a great company of Eagles to the Battle of the Black Gate on March 25, 3019. They swooped in to attack the Winged Nazgûl, but the Nazgûl fled when Sauron summoned them to fly to Mount Doom where Frodo Baggins stood at the Cracks of Doom with the Ring. After the Ring was destroyed, Mount Doom erupted and Frodo and Sam were stranded on a hill amid flowing lava and falling ash. Gandalf asked Gwaihir to bear him a final time. Accompanied by Landroval and Meneldor, Gwaihir raced swiftly to Mount Doom and with his keen sight, he spotted the Hobbits through the fumes.

Her offspring were a great bane on the world in later years. She was described as surrounded by \"an aura of darkness\". Her fate is unknown, but it is said that, always hungry, Ungoliant ended by devouring herself.\n\nThe Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, and his thirteen Dwarf companions encountered giant spiders in Mirkwood forest on their Quest to the Lonely Mountain. Only Bilbo's magic ring and an Elven blade (Sting) allowed them to escape being eaten.\n\nFrodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee encountered Ungoliant's daughter, Shelob, in her lair as they were trying to enter Mordor during their quest to destroy the One Ring. Frodo was ambushed by the spider twice, and was paralyzed by her poison on the second encounter. Sam used Sting to attack Shelob and wounded her, forcing her to flee the scene. It is unknown whether she died from her wounds.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the reason that Tolkien featured spiders so prominently in his stories was not because he was bitten by a tarantula when he was young, but rather because his son was afraid of them.\n\nIn LEGO The Lord of the Rings, the player must go through Shelob's Lair and kill at least six small spiders with Sauron's mark on their back.\n\nIn the Lord of the Rings Minecraft mod, spiders can be found in Mirkwood and Nan Ungol.

He first created a group of angelic beings, called in Elvish the \"Ainur,\" and these holy spirits were co-actors in the creation of Arda through a holy music and chanting called the \"Music of the Ainur.\" He is known also as \"the All-Powerful\".\n\nEru is an important part of the stories of The Silmarillion but is not mentioned by name in Tolkien's most famous works, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (He is alluded to as \"the One\" in a part of Appendix A that speaks of the downfall of Númenor).\n\nEru alone could create independent life or reality by giving it the Flame.\n\nElves and Men were created by Eru directly, without delegation to the Ainur, and they are therefore called \"Children of Ilúvatar\" (Eruhini). The Dwarves were created by Aulë with the belated blessing of Ilúvatar, though they would be second to the Children of Ilúvatar. Ents were also created by Eru under the request of Yavanna who reasoned that Dwarves would want to fell trees. Melkor instilled some semblance of free will into his mockeries of Eru Ilúvatar's creations (Orcs and Trolls).\n\nThe first things that Ilúvatar created were the Ainur (from his thoughts). He then bade the Ainur to sing to him; this was called the Ainulindalë, or the music of the Ainur. Melkor created a discord to the music, and Iluvatar added three themes to the Ainulindale, which talked about the fate of Arda.\n\nThe next thing he made was Eä, the \"World and All That Is\", and Eä was in the Void (Melkor was drawn to the Void, and so at the beginning of Arda, he lay in the Void, or the Outside as it was sometimes called). He then gave the Ainur the option to go into Eä and fashion it as they will. The Greatest Ainur who chose to do so were called the Valar, and they controlled the shaping of the Arda. They could not make life, however, as Aulë proves, who was able to give only shape to the Dwarves, while consciousness was given to them by Eru. The Valar were accompanied by the Maiar, the lesser Ainur. The elves and men, however, came directly from Ilúvatar's thoughts, and are referred to in The Silmarillion as The First Children of Ilúvatar and the Second Children of Ilúvatar, respectively, while the Dwarves would be the Adopted Children.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar"}}

He has a very tall and stiff-limbed appearance, with bark-like skin and leafy hair."],"name":"Treebeard","description":"Treebeard was the oldest ent who ever lived. He was so old that he remembered the time of Elves teaching the trees to speak, recalling how they wanted to talk to everything. In the time when Middle-earth was merely a giant forest, Treebeard roamed the land, presumably with his love, Fimbrethil. But after the loss of the Entwives, he and the remaining ents dwelt in the Forest of Fangorn, isolating themselves from the outside world.\n\nWith the arrival of the Istari in the year TA 1000 of the Third Age, Saruman came to Fangorn and befriended Treebeard, and would often visit him. The two would talk, discussing various subjects, with Saruman gathering information about the forest itself, and in particular its intertwining paths.\n\nAs the years passed and with no Entings due to the loss of the Entwives, the number of ents fell. Some ents in their old age became still and silent, almost becoming tree like as they slumbered. Treebeard, Finglas, Fladrif, Quickbeam and around fifty remained, some younger, some older. When Sauron's shadow began to spread across the land once more, Treebeard and the Ents remained in Fangorn, continuing to tend the trees, and taking no part in the affairs of Men, Elves and Wizards. However, they were brought into the war when Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took escaped from Saruman's Orcs, became lost in Fangorn Forest and befriended Treebeard. Upon learning that Saruman was cutting down the forest to power his war effort, an angry Treebeard called all the ents together for an Entmoot. After three days of deliberation, they decided to attack Isengard, in an event known as the Last March of the Ents.\n\nLeading the attack, Treebeard helped to bring down Isengard's walls and utterly destroy them, save the tower of Orthanc and Saruman himself who sat in his tower with his manservant Grima Wormtongue. The Ents also broke the dam wall which had starved the once green and beautiful Wizards Vale of all its water, flooding Saruman's pits, mines, and machines of war. Once Isengard was cleansed, Treebeard remained to guard over Saruman, but was ultimately unable to keep him, due to the power of Saruman's voice and the fact that Treebeard could not bear to lock any living thing up.\n\nAfter Aragorn was crowned king, he promised Treebeard that the Ents could prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of Mordor gone, and renew their search for the Entwives.  However, Treebeard sadly lamented that forests may spread once more, but the Ents would not, predicting that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn forest until they slowly dwindled in number.  However, he still held some hope for finding the Entwives, as he asked Merry and Pippin to watch for them near the Shire, and to bring word if they were to find them.\n\nTreebeard's ultimate fate is not known.  While he aged very slowly and was extremely long-lived, he was not immortal.  He most likely underwent the same fate of all the Ents: eventually settling down in one place, growing roots and leaves, and essentially becoming a tree himself, ceasing conscious thought.\n\nIn her final words to Treebeard during their parting at Isengard, Galadriel says she will \"Not [see him] in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again.  Then in the willow-meads of Nan-tathren we may meet in the spring.  Farewell!\" This suggests that in the future, perhaps after the Dagor Dagorath, when the lands of Beleriand will be recovered again, Treebeard and, possibly all the other Ents, will awaken again and that he will meet her again in Nan-Tathren.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's films The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Treebeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct; his voice is performed by John Rhys-Davies, who also plays Gimli.\n\nIn the movie The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), the Ents at the Entmoot initially decline Merry and Pippin's request for help. Treebeard is carrying the hobbits through the forest, when Pippin gets an idea. He asks Treebeard to carry them towards Isengard, because that is the last place Saruman would look for them. When Treebeard gets close to the forest's edge, he sees the devastation wrought by Saruman's orcs. The trees have all been chopped down to serve as fuel for Saruman's war machine. Treebeard then makes a momentous decision, and calls for the other Ents.\n\nThey attack Isengard and manage to flood it. In the book, Treebeard and the Ents decide to attack Saruman without any such coercion. They were already most likely aware of this situation.  When Gandalf arrives at Isengard in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Treebeard refers to Gandalf as \"young master Gandalf\".\n\nTreebeard is featured in The Lord of the Rings: Conquest in both the good and evil campaigns. In the first he appears in the Battle of Isengard level, where the player must deliver Gríma Wormtongue's key to Orthanc to him. In the second, an alternate timeline in which Frodo took the One Ring for himself sees Treebeard killed by the Balrog known as Durin's Bane.\n\nHe also appears in LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game, in which he is a playable character when one of the Hobbits is riding on his shoulder.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Treebeard"}}

Her elder brothers were Finrod Felagund, Angrod, and Aegnor. Galadriel was a niece of Fëanor, one of the most important elves of the First Age.","Galadriel was born in Valinor during the Years of the Trees, before the First Age had even begun. Much of Galadriel's story is confusing, and there are several distinct tales told about her collected in the Unfinished Tales. According to the older account, used in the published Silmarillion, Galadriel was an eager participant and leader in the rebellion of the Ñoldor and their flight from Valinor due to her desire to one day rule over a patch of Middle-earth herself.","Celeborn and Galadriel traveled first to Lindon, where they ruled over a group of Elves as a fiefdom under Gil-galad. Sometime later, they had a daughter, Celebrían. They moved eastward and established the realm of Eregion, or Hollin, which they ruled under Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor. Eregion, to the west of the Misty Mountains near Moria, was a prosperous kingdom during this time, and had open trade with the Dwarves. Also, during this time, they made contact with a Nandorin settlement in the valley of the Anduin, later to be known as Lothlórien. Subsequently, while Celebrimbor now ruled over Eregion, they left Eregion by way of the mines of Khazad-dûm and became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien.","The tales tell little of Galadriel or of Celeborn during many centuries in the Third Age, but after the formation of the White Council in TA 2463 she put forth her might in opposition of Sauron. She played a pivotal role in the formation of the Council, though her counsel to put Gandalf at its head was not followed. After Sauron was ousted from his fortress of Dol Guldur, Lórien kept vigilance over the region until the time of the War of the Ring.","Once in Caras Galadhon, Galadriel allowed Frodo and Sam to peer into the Mirror of Galadriel, enabling them to glimpse possible events of the future. She, in turn, was tested when Frodo Baggins later offered to place the One Ring in her keeping. To illustrate what would happen if she accepted, she presented an image of herself corrupted by the ring, declaring, \"In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!\" In the movie, what she says is different, which is: \"In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen! Not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me, and despair!\"","Besides her magical powers, Galadriel was also extremely wise and intelligent: she was one of the very few who were not fooled by Sauron in the Second Age, and therefore suggested to Celebrimbor to hide the Three Rings. She also refrained from openly using the powers of Nenya while the One Ring was in Sauron's possession, and only did so after the One Ring was lost (for it was only then that it was safe enough for her to do so). When Frodo offered her the One Ring, Galadriel managed to reject the undeniable temptation, for she was wise enough to know that, though she might start off with good intentions with the One Ring in her possession, she would only become a tyrant as terrible as Sauron in the end. This could be viewed as a testament to her excellent understanding of the seductive nature of power, as well as her awareness of her own personal limitations.","The name Galadhriel was used outside Lórien by the people who did not know the ancient days and Galadriel's history, confusing her name with the Elvish word galadh (\"tree\") and the name of the Galadhrim, the people of Lórien.","She is referred to as The Lady of Lórien, Lady of Light, The Lady of the Galadhrim, or The Lady of the Wood interchangeably. Within the realm of Lothlórien, she was referred to as simply Lady Galadriel or The Lady.","In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 Lord of the Rings, Galadriel is voiced by Scottish character actress Annette Crosbie.","In the extended edition, Galadriel and Celeborn give the other members of the Fellowship various gifts as well. Besides Frodo and Sam, she gave Merry and Pippin an Elven dagger, Aragorn a curved Elvish hunting knife, Legolas a Bow of the Galadhrim and three strands of Galadriel's hair was given to Gimli.","Galadriel first appears in An Unexpected Journey at a meeting of the White Council alongside Elrond, Gandalf, and Saruman. She believes Gandalf when he claims that the Necromancer is becoming a bigger threat and that something must be done with Dol Guldur.","Galadriel was voiced by Marian Diamond in the BBC's The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series).","The name Galadriel has moved outside of Tolkien's work and into the wider world; parents occasionally give it to their daughters, and at least one high-end shop has adopted it as their own. The Led Zeppelin songs Stairway to Heaven and The Battle of Evermore contain many references to Galadriel. The band Barclay James Harvest also wrote a song named \"Galadriel.\" Galadriel was the given name of the main character in the Katherine Paterson novel The Great Gilly Hopkins. In the novel Panic, there are a group of computer hackers known simply as Galadriel Jones and the elves. Since Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released, the elven names of Galadriel and Legolas, and Elrond were often used by fans to name their characters."],"name":"Galadriel","description":"The Lady Galadriel - \"Lady of Light\" - grandmother of Lady Arwen, is an Elven Queen of extraordinary beauty, with her timeless features and golden river of hair.\n\nGaladriel was highly praised for her beauty, particularly that of her hair, which was a deep and radiant gold, shot with silver. It was said by the elves of Tirion to have ensnared the light of the two trees, Telperion and Laurelin, and possibly to have inspired the creation of the Silmarils by Fëanor. She was also the tallest of elf-women, standing at around 6 feet 4 inches, or 193 centimeters. Because of her wisdom and power, she had very important roles throughout the history of Middle-earth, especially during her time in Eregion and during the War of the Ring. She had a penchant for dressing in the purest white.\nShe was known, especially in her younger days, as being quite prideful. However, by the end of the Third Age, that pride had been tempered a great deal by age.\n\nRegarding her decision to remain in Middle-earth, a passage says:\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Galadriel"}}

He founded of the House of Eorl, which ruled Rohan."],"name":"Eorl the Young","description":"Eorl the Young was the first King of Rohan. Eorl was a wise and valiant man and a great hero of his people. He had ruddy skin and blond hair that remained golden throughout his life.\n\nEorl was born in TA 2485. His father was Léod, the leader of the people called the Éothéod who lived in the far north near the source of the Anduin. In TA 2501 when Eorl was sixteen years old, Léod was killed by a wild horse that he had tried to tame; for this act the horse was called Mansbane by the Éothéod. Eorl hunted the horse and rather than kill him required that the horse serve him and surrender his freedom as a weregild. The horse submitted and Eorl renamed him Felaróf. Felaróf became Eorl's steed and was the father of the Mearas, who were the steeds of Eorl's descendants. It was also said that Felaróf would not permit any other man to ride him.\n\nEorl succeeded his father as the leader of the Éothéod. They were a numerous people with many horses. They needed more room to roam, but there was nowhere for them to go.\n\nOn March 25, TA 2510 - when Eorl was twenty-five years old - an errand-rider named Borondir arrived with a message from Cirion, the Steward of Gondor. Gondor was being threatened by Men from Rhun called the Balchoth, and Cirion sought Eorl's help in defeating them. Eorl agreed to come, because he knew that if Gondor fell, all of Middle-earth would soon be conquered. Borondir was one of several errand riders sent out by the Stewards, but the only one to get through, due to the intervening enemies. Eorl assembled his Council of Elders to prepare to ride south.\n\nOn April 6 , Eorl rode forth with an Éored - or mounted army - of 7,000 fully armed Riders and several hundred mounted archers. Only a few hundred Riders were left behind to guard the women, children, and elderly. The eohere rode southward through the Vales of the Anduin - a journey of over 500 miles.\n\nWhen they passed Dol Guldur in Mirkwood - where Sauron dwelled in secret - a darkness emanated from the fortress, and Eorl turned westward to avoid it. But then a white mist came from the woods of Lothlorien that stood across the River from Dol Guldur, and the Riders were hidden and continued safely on their way and, under the protection of the mist, apparently made the journey unwearyingly at an extraordinary rate of speed.\n\nEorl arrived at the Field of Celebrant on the morning of April 15. Gondor's army was being attacked on two fronts by the Balchoth and orcs from the Misty Mountains. Eorl and his Riders attacked the enemy from the rear, slaying many and driving the rest across the River Limlight. South of the Limlight lay the province of Gondor called Calenardhon, and Eorl and his Riders pursued the surviving enemies until the land was free of them.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, Eorl accompanied Cirion to the Mering Stream on the southeastern border of Calenardhon, where they parted company. Cirion asked Eorl to meet him there again in three months and committed Calenardhon to Eorl's care in the meantime.\n\nWhen they met again in August of 2510, Cirion brought Eorl to Halifirien, the Hill of Awe (also known as Amon Anwar because, unknown to all but the Steward and those in his deepest confidence, the Tomb of Elendil had stood since being placed there by Isildur after the fall of Sauron, in the Firien wood). There Cirion offered Eorl the land of Calenardhon as a new homeland for his people in gratitude for their service to Gondor. Eorl was deeply grateful for the Gift of Cirion, whom he admired as the wisest of all men then in Middle-earth. He accepted and he swore an Oath that his people would always come to Gondor's aid in time of need. Eorl realized that their peoples needed to remain allies in order to face the growing danger in Middle-earth. Cirion took a similar oath on behalf of the people of Gondor.\n\nEorl left about half his force to guard Calenardhon and returned to the far north to gather his people and their possessions. He led them back to their new homeland, and it became known as the Mark. In Gondor, the new land of their allies was called Rohan.\n\nEorl was King of the Mark for 35 years. He chose the hill at the entrance to the valley of Harrowdale to be the site of the town of Edoras. But Meduseld, the Golden Hall, was not completed in Eorl's lifetime, and he dwelled at Aldburg in the Folde. Eorl's son Brego was born in TA 2512.\n\nIn TA 2545, Rohan was attacked by Easterlings. The attack was thwarted, but Eorl fell in battle. He was buried in a mound outside Edoras, and his horse Felarof was buried with him. His son Brego succeeded him as King of Rohan.\n\nRohan continued to be ruled by the House of Eorl, and the people of Rohan called themselves the Eorlingas, or the Sons of Eorl. The Oath of Eorl was not forgotten. During the War of the Ring, King Theoden of Rohan honored his ancestor's Oath and came to Gondor's aid at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The Oath of Eorl was renewed by Theoden's successor King Eomer, who pledged continued friendship to Aragorn, King Elessar, of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Eorl_the_Young"}}

The Moth flies away, and shortly thereafter Gwaihir rescues Gandalf.\n\nMonths later, the same Moth is also seen during the Battle of the Morannon, flying around Gandalf to advise him that the Eagles are coming, exactly at the same time on which the Nazgûl are to attack Gondor's and Rohan's armies in the battle mounted on their flying fell beasts. The Moth is believed to be an Antheraea polyphemus.\n\nThe Moth appears twice in The Fellowship of the Ring and once in The Return of the King. There is a reported cameo in The Two Towers at Helm's Deep that many believe is The Moth.\n\nAt the end of An Unexpected Journey, during the ambush of Azog and his orcs, Thorin and Company become stranded on uprooted cliff-side trees. Thorin, Kili, Fili, Dwalin, and Bilbo rush in to a fight against the orcs, leaving the rest of the company behind, hanging over a cliff, in attempt to save them. Gandalf, hardly hanging on, notices a moth fly by his face. Shortly after, two dwarves fall from the tree and are caught by eagles, and the eagles take the company safely to the Carrock.\n\nThe Moth doesn't appear in the book, although it is possible that it indirectly appears, as Radagast the Brown says to Gandalf in The Fellowship of the Ring that he would send any messengers for help.\n\nMany believe that The Moth was inserted in the movie as a tribute to Radagast, who doesn't appear. Many argue that The Moth may be a messenger of Radagast or even Radagast himself.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Moth"}}

They were bred by Sauron in the late Third Age, possibly for the same reason Saruman bred the Uruk-hai, for improvement and less vulnerability to sunlight. They lived primarily in Mordor and in southern Mirkwood. However, they are described as being in the Battle of the Black Gate, where Pippin saves his friend Beregond from one. It is possible that some Olog-hai were also present at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nThe Olog-hai are described as being taller than a Man, and covered in spiky scales, carrying war hammers, large swords, or spiked maces, and bucklers, and having claws and, on occasion, tusks. It is mentioned that after the War of the Ring, all of the Olog-hai were killed.\n\nOlog-hai was a Black Speech word that meant 'troll-folk'. They seldom spoke and never in any language other than the Black Tongue of Mordor. 'Olog' meant 'troll' in Black speech and 'hai' meant 'folk. Uruk-hai meant 'orc-folk', and we can recognize the word 'hai' in both names because they both have the same word in English (folk).\n\nThey had none of the old Troll vulnerabilities: they were very intelligent and able to move under the Sun, unlike their other counterparts. For this reason they were seen by some to be Orcs like the Uruk-hai, but they were definitely of Troll stock. They were improved Trolls, much like the Uruk-hai were improved Orcs. The Olog-hai, however, may have actually been corrupted Trolls and marred by the Dark Powers like the Balrogs, Orcs, and Werewolves were.\n\nOlog-hai were shown as the shock troops in the motion picture The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, sporting dark armor and war hammers alluded to in the appendices. They were used in the Siege of Gondor as primary shock troops after the gates of Minas Tirith were broken, and an Olog-hai actually duels Aragorn at the Black Gate, according to the movie.  \n\nThey differ from the other Trolls depicted in the movies in that they have more forward-facing eyes as well as hair on their bodies, suggesting that they are a more advanced form of Troll. They are usually grey, dark green, reddish-brown, or black in color. They have twenty-four teeth and have an average height of about nine to eleven feet, compared to regular Trolls who were eight to ten feet.  \n\nTheir eyes are also bright orange, showing their evil connection with Sauron. Attack Olog-hai wear breastplates, vambraces, pauldrons, and helmets, and carry maces or huge swords. Despite their size they were exceptionally fast and were skilled enough to parry and engage in swordplay, as was the case with one that nearly killed Aragorn outside the Black Gate. \n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Olog-hai"}}

Frodo must deal with various small problems she has brought to his attention before she will listen to his offer to sell her the deed to Bag End."],"name":"Lobelia Sackville-Baggins","description":"Lobelia married Otho, and had a son, Lotho. Lobelia was known to be a covetous and grasping hobbit, and had designs on Bag End, as Otho was Bilbo's paternal first cousin and next of kin. During Bilbo's disappearance, Lobelia and Otho claimed the smial; when Bilbo returned from his adventure with Thorin and Company, Lobelia and Otho were in the midst of auctioning off the contents of Bag End with the firm of Grubb, Grubb and Burrows.\n\nAfter Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday party, Lobelia and Otho were incensed that Bilbo had left Bag End to Frodo, a more distant cousin once removed, and questioned the validity of Bilbo's will. Since much of Bilbo's silverware vanished during his adventure with the dwarves, when Bilbo left the Shire permanently, he gave Lobelia a box of silver spoons labeled \"For Lobelia, from Cousin Bilbo\", as a mathom. Eventually, Lobelia was able to acquire Bag End when Frodo sold it to her for under market value under his ruse of moving to Crickhollow, but by this time Otho had died and was unable to enjoy it.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Lobelia opposed Sharkey after hearing from the Ruffians that they were ordered to build sheds at Bag End. After rudely telling her to step aside, she became enraged and attacked the leader using only her umbrella as a weapon but she lost and was imprisoned in the Lockholes at Michel Delving. Freed after the Scouring of the Shire, Lobelia was greeted with raucous applause due to her spirit in defying Saruman's thuggery, and she was touched as she had never before been popular due to her avarice. However, she was heartbroken over Lotho's murder, and so granted Bag End back to Frodo and what was left of her money hoping he would use it to help hobbits who had lost their homes, due to Sharkey's tyranny. She moved in with her original family, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle. She died in the spring of 3020, and was over 100 years old.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lobelia_Sackville-Baggins"}}

Haldir was able to speak to the Fellowship, for he knew the Common Tongue. Haldir welcomed Legolas as one of his kindred from the north and recognized Aragorn as a friend to Galadriel. He was prepared to lead the Fellowship into Lórien, but he hesitated upon learning that one of the party was a Dwarf. After consulting with his brothers, Haldir agreed that Gimli could enter if he went blindfolded. The fellowship then insisted that if one of them had to go blindfolded, they all would. The brothers reluctantly agreed, and then led them into the forest.\n\nThey spent the night on a flet, or a platform in the trees. During the night, Haldir and his brothers heard orcs passing and lured them away from the Fellowship. When he returned to the flet, Haldir saw a strange creature at the base of the tree, which Frodo guessed to be Gollum.\n\nIn the morning, Haldir fashioned a rope bridge for the Fellowship to use to cross the Silverlode. Haldir learned from Merry Brandybuck that the Grey Havens lay west of the Shire, and he spoke longingly of the sea, but sadly of the time when he and his kin would have to leave Lorien.

Argon is only mentioned in The History of Middle-earth, in which it is told that he fought and died during the Battle of the Lammoth."],"name":"Fingolfin","description":"Fingolfin was born in Tirion in Valinor during the Noontide of Valinor. Neither he nor his brothers were particularly close to Fëanor, as he was rather scornful of them. Nonetheless, he lived in peace with his kin for many centuries. However, the peace of Valinor was brought to an end when Melkor, the most powerful of the Valar and the source of evil in Arda, was released from imprisonment. Feigning repentance and rehabilitation, Melkor's malice had in fact only festered and grown worse while imprisoned, and he sought to bring ruin upon the Elves for, as he saw it, causing his downfall. Of the three clans of Elves in Aman, only the Ñoldor welcomed him, as his knowledge was the greatest of any of the Valar. Gaining their confidence, Melkor was slowly able to spread lies and half-truths amongst them regarding the intentions of the Valar. Over time, these lies bore fruit and the Ñoldor began to openly debate remaining in Aman, and chief among the disgruntled Elves was Fëanor. One of the lies was that the sons of Indis, of which Fingolfin was the eldest, were trying to usurp Fëanor as the rightful heir of Finwë and seize the Silmarils, three magnificently beautiful gems that Fëanor had created, for themselves.\n\nFëanor, already not fond of his half-siblings, had little trouble believing the rumor. Fëanor hastened to Tirion and confronted Fingolfin, drawing his sword and threatening him with violence. When it became known what Fëanor had done to Fingolfin, he was called by the Valar to explain himself, and Melkor's lies were found out. However, Fëanor was held accountable for threatening Fingolfin and was banished to the fortress of Formenos in the north. Around twelve years later, the two brothers reconciled at a festival in Valinor (though Fëanor did so only grudgingly). However, during this festival, Melkor and the monstrous spider Ungoliant attacked, killing the Two Trees of Valinor and darkening all of Aman. They then assaulted the fortress of Formenos, where Melkor slew Finwë and stole Fëanor's Silmarils. In his pride, grief, anger, and selfishness, Fëanor sought revenge upon Melkor (now named Morgoth), and attempted to convince the rest of the Ñoldor to assist him by convincing them that journeying to Middle-earth would bring them glories and treasures untold. However, many were either not convinced or only half convinced, and deferred to Fingolfin, who was more trusted than his brother. Fingolfin, though not particularly keen to leave Valinor, had sworn to Fëanor to uphold his place as the elder brother, and did not want to abandon his people to the decisions of his rash and selfish brother. He decided to accompany Fëanor.\n\nAs such, Fingolfin ended up becoming the leader of the second and largest of the three Ñoldor hosts to leave Tirion for Middle-earth. Fëanor led the first, and Fingolfin's brother Finarfin led the third, smallest, and most reluctant host. Most of those who journeyed with him were somewhat reluctant to leave, and so it took a longer time for them to start their journey than the host directly following Fëanor. Unfortunately, this delay caused Fingolfin to make a grievous mistake, for not long after setting out, Fëanor attempted to seize the fleet of the seafaring Teleri Elves in order to get to Middle-earth more quickly and safely. The Teleri resisted fiercely, and Fingolfin's host caught up with Fëanor's during the middle of a heated battle. Seeing this, Fingolfin mistakenly assumed that the Teleri had attempted to waylay the Ñoldor, perhaps even at the request of the Valar. He and his host joined the battle against the Teleri, and completed the first Elven kinslaying. After the slaughter and the theft of the ships, the Ñoldor encountered a figure, possibly Mandos himself, who proclaimed a terrible Doom upon them for the Kinslaying. Hearing this, and having not participated at all in the slaughter of the Teleri, Finarfin's host turned back and returned to Tirion. The rest of the Ñoldor continued north, but as the journey grew more and more dangerous, many of the Ñoldor, upset about the Kinslaying and having been reluctant in the first place, began to openly curse Fëanor. In response, he and those most loyal to him departed one night on the Teleri ships. Upon reaching Middle-earth, Fëanor burned the ships. The fires were spotted by Fingolfin's host, and they knew that they were betrayed. Fingolfin's host's only route to Middle-earth was now to cross the phenomenally dangerous ices of the Helcaraxë or to return to Tirion in disgrace and suffer the punishment of the Valar for their role in the Kinslaying. But Fingolfin wished to continue to Middle-earth, in no small part to confront the brother for his utter betrayal. Fingolfin's host chose to cross the Helcaraxë, but lost many of its members along the way, greatly increasing the wrath and bitterness that Fingolfin and his host felt for Fëanor's host. The host of Fingolfin finally arrived in Middle-earth at the rising of the Sun (FA 1) and was assailed by an Orc army in Lammoth resulting in the death of Fingolfin's youngest child. Destroying the Orc host, Fingolfin and his army approached the doors of Angband, Morgoth's great fortress and smote upon them, but Morgoth and his servants, dismayed by the light of the new Sun, stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the Ñoldor then came to the northern shores of Lake Mithrim (FA 2), from which the Fëanorian part of the host had withdrawn.\n\nWith virtually all of Fingolfin's host furious over Fëanor's betrayal, it civil war might have broken out amongst the Ñoldor but for the actions of Fingolfin's son Fingon. After the initial confrontation of Fëanor's host against Morgoth's forces, the Elves had defeated their foes with relative ease, but Fëanor in his pride and wrath had thought to come upon Morgoth himself, and had pursued the remnants of Morgoth's army with only a small vanguard. Upon reaching Angband, this vanguard encountered a few Balrogs and had quickly been slain, with Fëanor falling at the hands of Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs. After this, Morgoth had sent a false claim of parley to the new leader of Fëanor's host; his eldest son Maedhros. Expecting treachery, both sides sent greater force than agreed upon to the negotiation site, but Morogth's had been accompanied by Balrogs, who slew the Elven company in short order and captured Maedhros. After failing to gain concessions from the Elves by offering to release Maedhros, Morgoth chained Maedrhos to a cliff by one hand and left him there. Fingon quickly learned of this and, having been a great friend of Maedhros before Fëanor's divisive actions, he sought to rescue his friend. Succeeding, both returned to the gathered Ñoldor, who were amazed at Fingon's actions. Seeking to keep his people united, Maedhros waived all claim to kingship, and Fingolfin thus became High King of the Ñoldor (FA 7). They were quickly able to establish mighty kingdoms in Beleriand, and subsequent attacks by Morgoth against them were repelled completely and with relative ease. Fingolfin established the Siege of Angband after the complete victory of Dagor Aglareb, and ruled in peace and prosperity from Hithlum, by the northern shores of Lake Mithrim. On FA 20, he hosted the famous feast of Mereth Aderthad in Eithel Ivrin, which was attended by emissaries from all the Elves in Beleriand. There Fingolfin retained close counsel and friendship with Maedhros.\n\nThough the Elves were able to contain Morgoth's Orcs, they did not possess the strength to attack Angband directly or actually overthrow Morgoth. Morgoth himself was not idle during the four hundred years of the siege, and he spent the time increasing the strength of his forces and creating new, deadlier creatures than Orcs for his armies. After reaching what he believed to be sufficient levels of soldiers, Morgoth's armies burst into Beleriand in the Dagor Bragollach. Accompanied by massive volcanic eruptions, the Orcs, Balrogs, and the dragon Glaurung completely overran the Elven defenses surrounding Angband, driving far into the south of Beleriand and slaughtering untold numbers of Elves. Fingolfin's kingdom in Hithlum managed barely to defend itself, as the mountains surrounding it provided protection against the flame and magma Morgoth had caused to spew from the Iron Mountains around Angband. But most of the other kingdoms of the Ñoldor were destroyed. The apparent totality of the defeat caused a great wrath and despair to overcome Fingolfin, and he resolved to go to Angband and challenge Morgoth himself to single combat. He mounted his horse and proceeded to ride across Anfauglith with such wrath that it was said that those who saw him mistook him for the Vala Oromë. He rode to Angband, unhindered by any of Morgoth's servants, smote upon the gates of Angband and shouted his challenge for all to hear, mocking Morgoth. Morgoth, though still said to be the \"mightiest of all things in this world\", was reluctant to face Fingolfin, because despite his might, he alone of the Valar knew fear. But Fingolfin's insults could not be ignored without Morgoth losing face before his captains. As such, he donned black armor, took up a great mace, and emerged from Angband. Fingolfin drew his sword, Ringil, and the duel began. Many times Morgoth attempted to smite Fingolfin, but the Elven King managed to dodge all of Morgoth's blows, and wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But after a time, Fingolfin grew weary, and Morgoth beat him to the ground three times. Fingolfin rose up and continued to fight each time, but as Mandos had foretold, no power of the Elves could defeat Morgoth, a Vala. Eventually, Fingolfin stumbled backwards into one of the many pits carved by Morgoth's failed strikes, and Morgoth stepped on the Elven King's neck and killed him. However, Fingolfin's last, desperate stroke managed to cut into Morgoth's heel.\n\nAfter defeating him, Morgoth took Fingolfin's body and broke it, intending to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of Eagles, swooped down upon Morgoth and with his talons slashed at Morgoth's face. As Morgoth reeled from this new assault, Thorondor retrieved Fingolfin's body and brought it to a mountaintop overlooking Gondolin. Turgon built a cairn over the remains of his father, and Fingon, in sorrow, became High King of the Ñoldor. After Fingolfin's defeat, though he had been defeated by Morgoth, the Orcs never made any type of boastful song to celebrate, nor did the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow was far too great. Morgoth walked with a limp after the duel, and the wounds he received pained him forever.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Fingolfin"}}

The alliance came to nothing and was a failure because both of the Mannish Kingdoms were under attack: Arnor by Angmar under the Witch-king, and Gondor by the Wainriders from the East.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Camp, Ondoher lost both of his sons Artamir and Faramir, and this meant that according to the Law of Númenor, Fíriel was now the Ruling Queen of Arnor. Arvedui used this to his advantage, as well as the fact that he was a direct descendant of the Númenórean nobleman Isildur. He used this argument to claim the crown of Gondor in an attempt to unite the Two Kingdoms, but this was refused by Gondor.\n\nFíriel remained with her husband in Arthedain, and when the kingdom fell to Angmar in TA 1974 after the Battle of Fornost, she probably fled with her son Aranarth to Lindon. Her son continued the Line of Isildur as first Chieftain of the Dúnedain in secret in the wild forests of Eriador. Her fate after her exile was not recorded but she certainly died.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/F%C3%ADriel"}}

There, he and Merry welcome Frodo, Sam and Pippin when those three arrive from Bucklebury.\n\nWhen Frodo and the rest set out to take the Ring to Rivendell, Fredegar stayed behind at Crickhollow in an attempt to keep up appearances and delay news of their departure. He was frightened half out of his wits by the arrival of the Nazgûl but escaped unharmed. Fredegar could have gone with Frodo and his companions into the Old Forest, but was terrified of the stories about it. Though Merry tried to persuade him that the Old Forest would be nothing compared to meeting the Ringwraiths, Fatty was adamant, so the other Hobbits went into the forest with only the knowledge of Merry to aid them. Soon while Frodo and his other friends left Fatty stayed to make Frodo seem like he hadn't left. Then on September the 30th Fredegard was attacked by Nazgûl and ran to the nearest house and raised the Horn-call of Buckland and so the Nazgûl left.\n\nDuring Saruman's rule of the Shire he led a group of partisans fighting against the Ruffians around the Hills of Scary, before eventually being captured. He and his sons were imprisoned in the Lockholes and starved, meaning that after his release nobody could call him Fatty any more.\n\nIn earlier drafts of The Lord of the Rings Fatty Bolger played a much larger role, but this was later abandoned. His role survives as a minor anomaly in the book \u2014 before the Hobbits go into the Old Forest, they have five ponies prepared \u2014 but only take four. Bolger was originally supposed to go with them.\n\nIt might be argued that Fredegar Bolger is the least heralded but perhaps the most significant of all the heroes of the War of the Rings: by delaying the Nazgul just slightly, he may well have turned the whole course of the War in favor of the West away from Sauron.... and for his heroism is starved in the Lockholes.\n\nSmall appearance in the movie\n\nIn the extended edition of the Fellowship of the Ring, there is a brief clip of Bilbo greeting Fatty Bolger, however, they do not show his face, and the clip is very brief. Some minutes later he appears again, cheering as Bilbo shouts his name. Though it is not confirmed that the hobbit cheering was Fatty, it is likely, as his appearance is very similar to that of the Fatty Bolger Bilbo greeted.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Fredegar_Bolger"}}

It was the largest of the nine winged steeds that were given to the Nazgûl after they were unhorsed at the Ford of Bruinen.\n\nAlthough mainly riding upon a horse for the majority of the trilogy, the Witch-king took up the fell beast towards the end of the War of the Ring. When the Rohirrim arrived at the Fields of Pelennor, the Witch-king quickly rode off and mounted the fell beast. In battle, he shot King Théoden's horse, which fell and pinned the king to the ground. Landing on the fallen king, the fell beast dug its claws into the flesh of Snowmane. Dernhelm (who revealed herself as Éowyn) defended the dying Théoden, and challenged and beheaded the beast.\n\nEven headless, the beast yet lived a few seconds before it died. Its master, the Witch-king, furiously attacked Éowyn, and almost killed her, but she survived and eventually killed him with the help of the hobbit Merry.\n\nIts headless corpse was later burned, and left a black, bare stain on the ground where it lay. Not more than ten days later, Sauron himself would be destroyed, and all the remaining fell beasts would perish in the ruin of Mordor, along with their unearthly masters.\n\nIn The Two Towers movie, in the fell beast's first appearance, it flies over Osgiliath as it is being attacked by Mordor, and it almost captures the hobbit Frodo Baggins after the Witch-king senses that the One Ring was with the halfling. But before the fell beast attacks Frodo, the other hobbit Samwise Gamgee saves him, and Faramir of Gondor shoots an arrow at the fell beast's neck. Frightened, the creature flies away to Mordor.\n\nIt was especially prominent during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where it, along with the other fell beasts, slaughtered many Gondorian soldiers, grabbing them and their horses with its powerful claws, lifting them high into the air, and dropping them to the ground. It, unlike the other Fell Beasts, wears a helmet, seemingly to show that it has superiority over the other flying monsters. Later, when the Rohan army arrived to help Gondor, the Witch-king commanded the fell beast to attack King Théoden of Rohan, and feast on his flesh.\n\nThe fell beast attacked and quickly killed Snowmane, Théoden's horse. The horse fell on Théoden, crushing him. He eventually dies of his wounds but not before he sees his niece kill the Witch-king. As in the book, the fell beast attempts to kill Eowyn, but she swiftly darts aside and cuts the beast's neck with two strokes. The headless corpse continues to writhe as it dies, flinging down the Witch-King from his saddle.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Witch-king%27s_Fell_Beast"}}

He commanded the tribes of Moria from TA 2790 until his death in TA 2799. He was responsible for the death of King Thror and for King Thrain's madness.","Azog then called out that he had killed Thrór , and that he now ruled Moria as king. His name in runes was carved onto the brow of Thrór, forever branding it into the hearts of the Dwarves. Nár was barred from retrieving the head of Thrór, and the orcs threw him a small pouch of coins of little worth as a final gesture of scorn. Nár took the pouch, turned, and fled. When he looked back, orcs had emerged from the gate and were hacking apart Thrór's body and flinging the pieces as carrion for the ravens.","Incidentally, this is the only place that Tolkien refers to Azog as a \"goblin\"; in other books such as The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien describes him as a \"great Orc.\" This is not a discrepancy, however, since as far as Tolkien was concerned, goblin is merely the English translation of the word orc, not a different type of creature, and in The Hobbit he almost always referred to orcs as goblins.","When Gandalf investigates Dol Guldur later in the film, he discovers the ruins are actually from a concealment spell placed by the Necromancer. As he removes the spell Azog leaps out and knocks him down in a surprise attack and taunts the wizard of his late interference, revealing the mass legions he has gathered. He prepares to kill him, but Gandalf uses his staff to keep the Defiler at bay, who still makes several attempts to strike. Gandalf escapes before the Dark Lord subdues him. Azog leads the army out towards the Lonely Mountain, determined to fulfill his oath in the upcoming battle against Middle-earth.","In the Battle of the Five Armies, Azog wore a chestplate and replaced his usual prosthetic arm with a double blade attached at the elbow. During his final battle with Thorin, he also abandoned his usual mace in favour of what appeared to be a large brick on a chain, perhaps salvaged from the decrepit towers of Ravenhill. He wielded this impromptu weapon much like a flail.","Azog was even able to throw Gandalf with a swing of his mace in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (despite the fact that he was eventually paralyzed by Gandalf's staff, allowing for the latter to temporarily escape from the Necromancer\/Sauron). Azog is shown to be an expert warg rider, able to tirelessly pursue Thorin and Company during the first film, and briefly shadows them during the second film. He is an excellent hunter and has almost limitless determination."],"name":"Azog","description":"Azog is depicted in the Hobbit film trilogy as the wrathful, psychopathic, iron-fisted, malevolent, bloodthirsty, insidious, cynical, bitter, malicious, arrogant, and merciless chieftain of the orcs of Moria and leader of the warg riders. He is portrayed to be cunning, monomaniacal, and very, very ruthless, with a bitter and hateful obsession for vengeance against Thorin Oakenshield for cutting off his arm in battle.\n\nAzog was also shown to have some fascist qualities, judging by his complete intolerance towards failure and his dictatorship over his orc pack. The one most surprising thing about Azog is even someone as powerful as Azog has a master, the incredibly powerful Necromancer: Sauron.\n\nHe is shown to be intensely sadistic, gleefully mocking Thorin in their second confrontation by saying that his father \"reeked of the smell of fear\" (which apparently made Thorin think that Azog killed his father) to goad him into attacking. He also seemed to enjoy watching the wargs attacking the dwarves.\n\nDespite this, he has a close relationship with his son Bolg, as he expresses great pride in him. Yet Azog holds high expectations for him, and can become very angered if his expectations are not met. He is also more independent compared to most other orcs, as he inspires strong leadership and self-reliance that can only be matched by a hunter or a true-born warrior. Azog is enigmatic and powerful, and a superb ally for Sauron to have at his side.\n\nAzog's monomania is shown by his obsession with wiping out the line of Durin. He made good on his vow by murdering Thrór and also driving Thrain into hiding. However, he was too arrogant to think that Thorin could beat him, even though he managed to completely disarm the latter during their climatic duel at Azanbulbizar. After this, he became hell-bent on revenge, incredibly determined to kill Thorin Oakenshield for cutting off his arm.\n\nThis drove Azog not to care what the cost was, so long as it gave him a chance to get his own back on the dwarf prince. Although it isn't clear why, when he actually manages to disable Thorin during their second brawl, he didn't go and kill Thorin himself.  His obsession is also clear in his disappointment that Sauron didn't value Thorin's death as enormously as Azog himself did.\n\nHis ruthlessness is displayed when he murders his own allies when they displease him. A vicious psychopath, Azog is easily frustrated, even by his Master and by his own followers. He is extremely fierce-tempered and has a serious impulse-control problem, capable of violent mood swings when he becomes too angry to control himself. He is also highly intelligent, displaying excellent hunting skills and experience in combat.\n\nHe is unfailingly loyal to Sauron, despite his obvious distrust in the Dark Lord. His loyalty to Sauron shows that, instead of leading his army against Thorin and the dwarves (which could have ended in complete success), Azog stays alongside Sauron to defend him against Gandalf. This almost led to his death. Azog was extremely aggressive, to allies and enemies alike.\n\nAzog was impatient and repressive: he didn't tolerate Yazneg's mistake during the hunt for Thorin Oakenshield, and killed the orc out of anger. Also, he reacted furiously when the eagles rescued Thorin and Company. He also didn't respond civilly when Sauron denied him Thorin Oakenshield's head (which shows also how reckless he is; no-one would dare speak up to the Dark Lord in that manner). He is implied to understand English, as he answered a question Gandalf asked him in English, hinting that he can speak it, but simply chooses not to. He also seemingly knew a great deal about the line of Durin, as he knew that Fili had a brother, and that they were the heirs to the throne.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Azog"}}

The name Curufinwë is also Fëanor's original name. This was because Curufin was most like his father both in appearance, temperament and skill. His mother-name is Atarinkë (\"Little Father\") for he resembled his father in both mind and talent. He was called Kurvo by his family members.","Tolkien provided Old English names for his characters. For Curufin, the name Cyrefinn Fácensearo was given, from the Old English words cyre (\"choice\"), facen (\"deceit, guile, wickedness\"), saeru (\"skill\"), and fácensaeru (\"treachery\")."],"name":"Curufin","description":"Curufin was born in Valinor sometime in during the Noontide of Valinor. There he married unnamed Elf (probably a Ñoldor) and had a son they called Celebrimbor, who would later follow him to exile. As with all the Elves of Aman, they lived in peace and prosperity until the release of Melkor, the murder of Finwë and the theft of the Silmarils that led to the Flight of the Noldor.\n\nAs with the other Sons of Fëanor, Curufin was bound by an oath to recover his father's Silmarils, which had been stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth. His oath took him and his brothers to Middle-earth during the First Age.\n\nArriving in Middle-earth, Fëanor roused Curufin and others who were most obedient to him, and set the swan-ships aflame. However, in the ensuing chaos, his youngest brother Amras was accidentally burned alive. Later, Curufin and his brothers fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath but lost their father Fëanor.\n\nCurufin and his older brother Celegorm (and possibly Celebrimbor) lived in Himlad, east of his brother Maedhros' fortress Himring and south of Aglon, a Pass between Himring and Dorthonion, leading into Doriath. Around this time, their cousin Aredhel left Gondolin in search for both sons of Fëanor. However, Curufin and Celegorm were not in their lands when she arrived, thus Aredhel left and traveled south and was lost in Nan Elmoth. Years later, Aredhel and her son Maeglin left Nan Elmoth, and Eöl traveled after them, only to be brought to Curufin. Though they had no love for him and scorned him, they did not slay him and allowed him to continue on his way.\n\nThe two brothers fortified their realms with great strength and held them until the Dagor Bragollach, by which time it was forced. However, following the Dagor Bragollach, the two brothers were defeated and had to flee with their people to Nargothrond, where Finrod welcomed them.\n\nShortly after, Beren also came to Nargothrond to remind Finrod of the oath he had sworn, and claim his help. Finrod decided to help Beren, but Celegorm and Curufin, remembering their Oath, persuaded the people of Nargothrond not to follow him, and not to wage open war against Morgoth, making them fearful. Finrod therefore had to leave with a handful of warriors, including Beren, and later died. His nephew Orodreth was made to rule in his stead.\n\nHe and his brother went hunting with Celegorm's hound Huan, then found Lúthien, daughter of Thingol, as she fled to find Beren. Feigning to help her, they took her captive and brought her to Nargothrond, for Celegorm had become enamoured and would have Thingol give him her hand. However, Huan helped Lúthien to flee, and they freed Beren and other thralls from Sauron. As these thralls returned, the people of Nargothrond perceived the two brothers' treachery, and though Orodreth would not let them be slain, he cast them from Nargothrond.\n\nThe two brothers met Lúthien and Beren as they fled, and Curufin fought with Beren losing the knife Angrist in the struggle. Defeated, he had to flee with Celegorm, but sought to slay Lúthien even as he did, and shot Beren instead.\n\nDue to Celegorm and Curufin's deeds, Thingol and Orodreth would lend no aid to Maedhros as he sought to unite Elves, Dwarves, and Men in what was called the Union of Maedhros.\n\nCurufin fell in the Second Kinslaying, when the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of the Elvish King Dior the Beautiful. His brothers Celegorm and Caranthir died with him during the assault.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Curufin"}}

She and Beren braved Morgoth's horrors, eventually winning the Silmaril and the respect of Thingol.

Throughout the years before she met Beren, she lived as all the Elves of Doriath did: in a state of perfect blissful peace. She was a woman of incomparable beauty and grace, with night-dark hair, sparkling grey eyes, luminous skin, and a clear heartbreakingly lovely voice that was said to cause winter to melt into spring - \"the song of Luthien released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed\". She also often enjoyed dancing in the woods of the realm to the music of her good friend Daeron's flute. He himself soon came to love her jealously, but she did not return it.\n\nLúthien was remembered in the Lay of Leithian as the first Elven woman to have fallen in love and married a mortal man, Beren, a Man of the House of Bëor whom she met in the woods of Doriath. Their relationship was unlikely from the beginning: Lúthien was not only the cherished single daughter of the most powerful Elven King in Beleriand, but also the daughter of a Maia, a powerful angelic being of the race of the Ainur. Beren was a mortal man on the run from the first Dark Lord Morgoth.\n\nThingol was desperate not to let Beren marry his daughter, and set an impossible task as the bride price: Beren had to bring to Thingol one of the Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown. Against monstrous odds, being kidnapped by the Sons of Fëanor and the death of Finrod Felagund, as well as a confrontation with Sauron, the couple achieved the task with help from Huan, the Hound of Valinor, but Beren died as soon as it was completed. In grief, Lúthien lay down and died, passing to the Halls of Mandos. There, in her grief, she sang to Mandos. Her song was of such beauty that Mandos, for the first and only time in his existence, was moved to pity. But Mandos had no authority to allow Beren to live again, so he went before Manwë for advice, who in turn sought out the counsel of Eru Ilúvatar himself. Two choices were then placed before Lúthien; she could either dwell in Valimar with the Valar in bliss forever as reward for all that she had accomplished, or she could be restored to life again with Beren, on the condition that they would both be mortal and die the death of Men. For her love of Beren, Luthien chose the latter.\n\nAfter this, she became a mortal and returned to Middle-earth with Beren, and lived briefly in Tol Galen. They had a son, Dior, who was called Elúchil, the Heir of Thingol.\n\nAfter the sack of Menegroth, Beren returned there and ambushed the dwarves and took Nauglamir back to Luthien. Her beauty combined with the splendor of the gem and necklace to make her home of Tol Galen the fairest land ever to have existed east of Valinor. On her death the Nauglamír was delivered to her son Dior, which led to the ruin of Doriath.\n\nThe union of Beren and Lúthien was the first between a mortal Man and an Elven maid. Their lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of the Kingdom of Númenor, and then on to the Dúnedain, men living in exile in Middle-earth, and on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond. Lúthien's romance with Beren is one of the great stories of the Elder Days, and is mirrored by the later romance between Aragorn and Arwen Evenstar. According to legend, her line will never be broken as long as the world lasts.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/L%C3%BAthien"}}

As in Scandinavian, the \"y\" in the second syllable is the same sound as the German letter \"ü\" or the French \"u\".","Éowyn's title was the Lady of Rohan and was also known as \"The White Lady of Rohan\" due to her pale complexion. She also used the alias \"Dernhelm\" while riding with Rohan's army, and after her wounding by the Witch-king in the Pelennor Fields as \"Lady of the Shield-arm\". After her marriage to Faramir she was called the Lady of Ithilien (in contrast to Faramir, who was styled Prince of Ithilien), and Lady of Emyn Arnen.     ","In Shakespeare's Macbeth, the title character believes he is invincible because the three Witch Sisters have prophesied that \"no man of woman born\" will defeat him.

Because the film was produced in isolation (without accompanying versions of The Fellowship of the Ring or The Two Towers), and hastily compresses the plot of the book, Éowyn does not appear in the film at all until the climactic moment on the Pelennor Fields when she reveals her identity to the Witch-king and attacks him."],"name":"Éowyn","description":"Éowyn was the second child of Éomund and Theodwyn. Like her brother Éomer, she was related to King Théoden through their mother, the King's sister. Her father was slain and her mother dies of illness in TA 3002. Afterwards, Théoden took Éomer and Éowyn in his household and raised them as his children.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Éowyn was forced to stay in Meduseld and care for her declining uncle for several years, as he was weakened by the influence of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. When Gandalf restored the King, he prepared to defend Rohan against Isengard. Since Théoden planned to ride to battle himself, he asked his doorwarden Háma, to suggest a leader for the people in his absence. Háma recommended Éowyn, who, though a woman, was \"fearless\" and \"all love[d] her.\"\n\nÉowyn reluctantly obeyed the King's orders to stay behind in Edoras while Aragorn, Théoden, and the rest of the men confronted Saruman's army at the Battle of the Hornburg. When they returned, victorious to Edoras, Éowyn had kept everything in perfect order for their return.\n\nWhen Denethor II urgently called for Théoden's aid against Mordor, Éowyn again, begged to be allowed to ride with Aragorn to battle, but he refused.\n\nIn bitterness, she disguised herself as a man, under the alias Dernhelm, and rode to Minas Tirith on her horse Windfola. She took Meriadoc Brandybuck along because he likewise wanted to follow his friends to battle, but had been refused by Théoden. Because Éowyn weighed less than a man of similar height, Windfola was able to bear Merry as well as her.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, she fought in Théoden's escort; when he and his company were attacked by the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the Nazgûl, she and Merry were the only riders who did not flee. As Théoden lay mortally wounded, she challenged the Witch-King, who boasted that \"no living man may hinder me.\" In answer, she removed her helmet, exposing her long blond hair, and declared, \"No living man am I! You look upon a woman! Éowyn I am, Éomund's daughter. Begone if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him!\"\n\nIn a rage, the Witch-King attacked her, but she cleaved the head off his Fell Beast. The Witch-King shattered her shield with a blow of his mace, breaking her arm, but stumbled when Merry stabbed his leg from behind with a Barrow-blade of Westernesse make. Éowyn stabbed her sword through the Witch-King's head, killing him, and thus fulfilling Glorfindel's prophecy a thousand years earlier at the Battle of Fornost that \"not by the hand of man\" would the Witch-King fall.\n\nHer constitution already severely weakened by her loneliness and despair, combined with her physical injuries, Éowyn succumbed to a severe case of the Black Breath. Théoden, not knowing that she was nearby, told Merry with his dying words that she had been \"dearer than daughter\" to him.\n\nSeeing her lying apparently dead on the battlefield caused her brother Éomer to go temporarily mad, and charge in fury at the enemy. But during the battle she was found by Prince Imrahil, who noticed that she was still alive, though barely, and ordered her taken to the Houses of Healing. There she was healed by Aragorn, the plant Athelas, and the entreaties of her distraught brother.\n\nÉowyn remained behind in Minas Tirith while the Army of the West marched toward Morannon, the Black Gate, to challenge Sauron. She met and fell in love with Faramir, who had likewise been injured before the battle. After the War of the Ring had ended, she decided to give up dreams of glory in battle and devote her life to peace and a happy marriage.\n\nAt Éowyn's insistence, Merry was made a Knight of the Riddermark. Merry attended Théoden's funeral and Éomer's coronation as King of Rohan, where Éowyn presented Merry with a parting gift: the Horn of Rohan, a small silver horn taken from the hoard of Scatha, the dragon.\n\nFaramir and Éowyn settled in Ithilien, where they had at least one son (likely Elboron), and their grandson was Barahir, who wrote The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen in the Fourth Age. The date of Éowyn's death is nowhere recorded.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/%C3%89owyn"}}

When asked by a suspicious Théoden to take any horse and be gone, Gandalf chose Shadowfax (much to the King's displeasure), tamed him, and used the great steed's speed to cross the vast wilderness between Rohan and the Shire in only six days. He dismissed the horse shortly before arriving in Rivendell and Shadowfax returned to Rohan.\n\nHe is next seen when Gandalf (now the White) called him when he, Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas needed horses to travel through Rohan. Legolas instantly recognises the race of the horse, exclaiming that it is \"of the Mearas\". While for the most part, Gimli rode with Legolas upon a grey horse named Arod, provided by Éomer, on the way from Fangorn to Edoras, Shadowfax carried both Gandalf and him, due to his greater strength and stamina when compared to the lesser steeds and the urgency of their journey.\n\nFrom then on, and especially after he is officially gifted to him by Théoden, Shadowfax became Gandalf's permanent steed, earning the wizard the epithet The White Rider. Gandalf often used Shadowfax's great speed to his advantage, for instance during the Battle for Helm's Deep, where he organized the scattered Rohirrim army under Erkenbrand and led the attack. It was said by Theoden that there will never be a finer horse in Middle-earth again.\n\nHe was instrumental in transporting Gandalf and Peregrin Took from Rohan to Minas Tirith, when Sauron believed that Peregrin had the Ring after seeing him in Saruman's Palantír.\n\nShadowfax was vital during the Siege of Gondor, where Gandalf supported the army of Gondor defending the Rammas Echor, while regularly escorting medical transport to the City. Because of the horse's speed he was also able to save Faramir, who had commanded the retreating army's rearguard, from an attack by the Nazgûl. During the later stages of the siege, when Gandalf rode Shadowfax as he faced the Lord of the Nazgûl at the Gate of Gondor, Shadowfax alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror and stood unmoving, steadfast before the Nazgûl. And finally, Gandalf used Shadowfax's swiftness to help him save Faramir from his crazed father Denethor, who had intended to burn his wounded son and himself alive on a funeral pyre.\n\nShadowfax was also present at the Final Battle before the Black Gate, though it is unclear whether or not Gandalf fought on horseback.\n\nHe afterwards carried Gandalf on the return journey to the North.

His name was likely derived from the Anglo-Saxon words \"eoh\" (\"war-horse\"), \"maer\" (famous), and \"éadig\" (\"blessed\").","The name Éomer appears as the name of a King of the Angles, both in both the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in which he is the son of Angeltheow and grandson of Offa and, in its West Saxon form ?om?r, in the epic poem Beowulf, in which he was the son of Offa and Modthryth and grandson of Wermund.","In the Lord of the Rings film trilogy by Peter Jackson, Éomer is exiled by Gríma Wormtongue before meeting Aragorn, and is an outcast until he arrives at Helm's Deep, summoned by Gandalf. In this sense, his character has been combined with the character of Erkenbrand, who, in the book, is the one with whom Gandalf returns to Helm's Deep. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the third film, Éomer kills the Chief of the mumakil riders. Éomer was played by New Zealand actor Karl Urban.","Éomer also appears in The Lord of the Rings Online.","Éomer appears as a character LEGO The Lord of the Rings."],"name":"Éomer","description":"Éomer, born in TA 2991, of the House of Eorl, was the son of Éomund, a descendant of Éofor, and of Theodwyn, sister of Theoden King. In TA 3002, when Éomer was eleven, Éomund was slain in battle with Orcs. Theodwyn died of grief shortly afterward. Éomund also had a daughter named Éowyn, Éomer's sister. After they were orphaned Théoden adopted them as his own children.\n\nÉomer was third Marshal of the Mark, and was a strong leader of Men. Éomer was faithful to his country, and people. He was honored highly, and prized extensively by the king and was good friends with Théodred, son of Théoden who loved him like a brother.\n\nHis éored hunted down the Uruk-hai that had taken Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took as they camped near Fangorn forest, slaying them all. He never saw the Hobbits, as they fled during the battle. Afterwards he met Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas in the plains of Rohan, and he lent them two horses, Arod and Hasufel.\n\nÉomer returned to Edoras and reported on meeting the Ranger and friends and allowing them to go free, a violation of the king's law. Under the poisonous advice of Gríma Wormtongue, he was imprisoned by Théoden, who had grown weak, aged, and suspicious under Saruman the White's influence.\n\nAfter Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas reunited with Gandalf, the four hastened to Edoras, where Gandalf broke Saruman's influence over Théoden and restored him to health and vitality. Théoden freed Éomer, who offered his sword to Théoden in token of his loyalty. Théoden named Éomer his heir prior to riding away from Edoras to the defense of the Hornburg.\n\nAt the Battle of the Hornburg, he and his éored drove the orcs and Dunlendings of Saruman into the walls of the Glittering Caves and in the Huorn forest, where they were killed. One of the main defences that Éomer was involved in was the defence of the gate where he, Aragorn, and a small band of men left through a small door at the side of the Hornburg and led an assault on the forces attempting to break the gates of the Hornburg. After this attack Éomer and Aragorn attempted to return through the door when Éomer was jumped upon by several orcs who had laid low during the assault though Éomer was saved by Gimli who had secretly followed him out to the gate.\n\nAfterwards he rode with Théoden, Aragorn, and Gandalf to Isengard, where they were greeted by Merry and Pippin, who were celebrating their recent victory. Treebeard and his felllow Ents, remained as well in order to guard the now imprisoned Saruman and Wormtongue.\n\nAfter the \"Warning Beacons of Gondor \" were lit, Theoden agreed to gather what forces he had to help defend the city of Gondor against the impending battle with the forces of Mordor. Theoden and Eomer manged to rally six thousand soldiers, before travelling to \"The White City\". The armies of Rohan, manged to arrive at Pellenor, just before the City Gates could be breached. Eomer fought gallantly, slaying many foes. But Théoden was fatally crushed by his horse, Snowmane, after being thrown by the Witch King's Fell Beast. Coming upon their corpses, Eomer was driven to temporary madness at seeing Eowyn, his sister, among the King's retinue, apparently dead, and charged in renewed fury at the forces of Mordor. He and Aragorn met on the battlefield and reaffirmed their loyalty to each other, before returning to the long, grim work of winning the battle.\n\nIn the battle's aftermath, Eomer attended his sister in the Houses of Healing, and, with Aragron and Meriadoc Brandybuck, helped call his sister back to consciousness. Aragorn said that, as broken as Eowyn's heart had been over her unrequited love for Aragorn, her love for her brother was much more real to her, and a much more potent reason for her to live.\n\nÉomer became King of the Mark upon Théoden's death. Following the battle, Éomer and his men went back to Edoras to attend to affairs of the kingdom, returning later to bear the body of Théoden back to his home for burial.\n\nÉomer renewed the Oath of Eorl with Aragorn after Aragorn had been crowned King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom, and Éomer had been crowned King of Rohan, swearing everlasting friendship between Rohan and Gondor (and legalizing Cirion's grant of Calenardhon to the Éothéod.)\n\nHe became known as Éomer Éadig, or \"the Blessed\", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again.\n\nÉomer had met Lothíriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth during his stay in Gondor, and they were wed. She bore him a son Elfwine, who succeeded his father, after Éomer's death in the year FO 63.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/%C3%89omer"}}

Two Maiar came: Curumo (or Curunir; later known as Saruman) sent by Aulë, and Alatar (Morinehtar), sent by Oromë. Manwë asked where Olórin (later known as Gandalf) was, and he came, after returning from a journey. Manwë asked Olórin if he would go as the third messenger. Olórin said he was too weak and that he was afraid of Sauron; however, Manwë said that was all the more reason to go, and that he commanded Olórin to go as the third. Then Varda said \"Not as the third.\" Yavanna begged Curumo to take Aiwendil (Radagast), and Alatar took Pallando (Rómestámo) as a friend. They were forbidden to dominate the free peoples of Middle-earth or to match Sauron's power with power. When Saruman, the greatest of the Wizards, disobeyed this injunction, he was cast from the order and banished from ever returning to Valinor.\n\nThe Wizards were known by various names, and were arrayed in different colours. Of those who came to Middle-earth, sent by the Valar, five are known, the Heren Istarion (Order of Wizards). After arriving in Middle-earth, the two Blue Wizards apparently went east before the War of the Ring; whether they played a part in the events of that war is unknown. (Note: According to Tolkien's letters they may have formed cults for magic worship and practice among the Easterlings.) Radagast the Brown concerned himself mainly with plants and animals, and lived in Mirkwood for many years. Saruman the White and Gandalf the Grey spent time with the Free Peoples: the Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Saruman was wise and respected and became head of the White Council in TA 2463. However, he became prideful and jealous of the potential and purity of spirit of Gandalf, who would eventually surpass him in power. Saruman slowly came to betray the original purpose of the Wizards, and sought power for himself. He was overthrown during the War of the Ring, by his tormented servant, Grima Wormtongue. Grima slit Saruman's neck after a failed attempt to rule the Shire. Saruman's spirit looked to the West and Valinor, but was blown away.\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, the Wizards passed from sight; since, with the fall of Sauron, their work was done. Gandalf passed over the Sea with the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings. Saruman became a naked spirit and wandered Middle-earth forever, since he was banished from Valinor. Radagast stayed in Middle-earth, tending to the wilderness. The fate of the Blue Wizards is unknown.\n\nThe wizards bore the forms of old Men; they were ancient and seemed to age very slowly. They possessed great skill of body and mind; the greater portion of their power as Maiar resided in their staffs. Each of the Istari had his own colour and grade within the Order. Saruman the White was the eldest and Gandalf the Grey second. The other Istari were Radagast the Brown and the two Blue Wizards, who dwelt far in the east.\n\nIstari is a Quenya word (singular Istar).

Originally, he was the chief of the wizards and of the White Council that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark magic, however, eventually led him to desire the One Ring for himself. Thinking he could ally himself with Sauron and then betray him, Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was defeated.","Left out of the final stages of the War of the Ring, Saruman eventually managed to persuade the Ents who kept him captive into letting him leave Isengard after he met the conditions of handing over the Keys of Orthanc. He then went to the Shire, which his agent Lotho Sackville-Baggins had brought under control. He spent his final days as a small-time criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the Orkish sharkû, meaning \"old man\"), until he was overthrown in the Battle of Bywater. In the aftermath of that battle Frodo confronted Saruman and exiled him from the Shire, but before he could leave Gríma Wormtongue killed Saruman by slitting his throat with a dagger, on the very doorstep of Bag End.","After his departure from Orthanc, King Elessar entered the tower with the intent of re-ordering that realm. Inside, Elessar's men found many treasures that Saruman had conned off of King Théoden. There was a secret closet that could only be found with the aid of Gimli the dwarf; it contained the original Elendilmir, which had presumed to be lost forever when Isildur perished in the Gladden Fields, as well as a golden chain which was presumed to have once borne the One Ring.","Saruman, being a Maia, did not truly die. His spirit separated from his body much like Sauron's after the Downfall of Númenor. As an incorporeal spirit, he should have been called to the Halls of Mandos, but the tale implies that he was barred from returning. Tolkien indicated that his spirit was left naked, powerless and wandering, never to return from Middle-earth:","Saruman was extremely learned in Ringlore and mechanics, and his knowledge enabled him to create great forges. Unfortunately, it was Saruman's extensive knowledge of the Rings of Power that led to his downfall, as he became enamored of the power of the rings, and particularly the One Ring.","The Scouring of the Shire, which is where Saruman meets his end in the novels, is entirely omitted from the film adaptations. Jackson considered the Scouring anticlimactic.","Saruman first appears in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. He arrives in Rivendell for a meeting of the White Council. Saruman expresses his disapproval of Gandalf's actions concerning the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and dismisses Gandalf's reasons as 'looking for trouble where none exists'. He is skeptical of the information Gandalf provides on the Necromancer and he further dismisses the information when he learns it came from Radagast the Brown, who he believes is a fool and an embarrassment to the Istari due to his consumption of mushrooms. When presented with the Morgul blade, Saruman states there is no proof that it belonged to the Witch-king of Angmar. Saruman sums up all of Gandalf's concerns as nothing to worry about but states that he feels he cannot condone the quest of the Dwarves to reclaim Erebor. However, unbeknownst to Saruman, the Dwarves have already left Rivendell.","In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film of The Lord of the Rings, Fraser Kerr provided the voice of Saruman. At one point in that film's development, film executives thought that the names \"Saruman\" and \"Sauron\" were too similar, and would confuse the audience, and decided that Saruman should be renamed \"Aruman\". This decision was eventually reversed, but some references to \"Aruman\" remained in the finished film. The dialogue of Bakshi's film retained Saruman's adoption of the title \"Saruman of Many Colours\", and the character was dressed in red. In Ralph Bakshi's animated film, Saruman sends a swirling stream of magical fire from Isengard to Helm's Deep to blow apart the ramparts and walls of Helms Deep.","Peter Howell played Saruman in BBC Radio's 1981 serialisation of The Lord of the Rings."],"name":"Saruman","description":"Saruman was originally a Maia of Aulë the Smith - just as Sauron had once been - named Curumo, meaning \"skillful one\", or Curunír by the elves in Sindarin. In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by Manwë, leader of the Valar, shortly after Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Though Sauron was overthrown, it would later turn out that he had not been effectively vanquished and his shadow began to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to send five emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be \"mighty, peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,\" as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the wizards were forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.\n\nThe other four who were chosen were Olórin (Gandalf), Aiwendil (Radagast), and Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo was appointed overall leader of the group.\n\nThe five wizards arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador around the year 1000. Only the keeper of the havens, Círdan the Shipwright, knew Saruman's identity and origin. Saruman would later discover that Círdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to Gandalf upon their first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Saruman was immediately considered the head of the order while Gandalf was not, Círdan had divined Gandalf as the wisest and greatest of the wizards. Saruman's jealousy of Gandalf grew from these events, perhaps because he feared that he would eventually supplant him as chief of wizards.\n\nSaruman and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth. After one and a half millennia, he returned to the west, just as Sauron's power was growing again in Dol Guldur.\n\nWhen the White Council was formed at approximately year 2463 of the Third Age in order to counter Sauron, Saruman was appointed its leader, though Galadriel wanted Gandalf in this position. Saruman refused to step down due to his pride, while Gandalf had declined. At this point Saruman had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron and to envy and desire his power, and especially the One Ring. This was also the same year that the One Ring was taken by the Halfling Sméagol (later called Gollum), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds of years. It was during the meetings of the Council that Saruman first noted Gandalf's interest in Hobbits and The Shire, and believing that all his deeds related to some as yet undisclosed plan of his for self-enhancement, Saruman himself began keeping a greater watch on Gandalf and sent spies to The Shire. At first, he himself visited it secretly but stopped when he realized that its inhabitants had noticed him. Amongst the purposes of his visits was to procure some of the halflings' Pipe-weed, since in secret imitation of Gandalf he had begun to smoke.\n\nIn the year TA 2759, Saruman settled in Isengard with the permission of the Steward of Gondor, Beren, although he settled only as Warden of the Tower and representative of the Steward (the stronghold had by then been abandoned by Gondor). There he became important in the informal alliance defending the west of Middle-earth. In the tower of Isengard, Orthanc, he also found one of the remaining Palantíri.\n\nIn TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil presence was indeed Sauron. By Saruman's advice, the White Council decided against attacking Dol Guldur. Gandalf would later remark that it was at this council meeting that he first began to suspect that Saruman desired to possess the One Ring. Saruman's real intention was to permit Sauron to build up his strength, so that the One Ring would reveal itself. He later found that Sauron had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected, and in TA 2941, he finally agreed to attack Dol Guldur.\n\nTen years after, Sauron abandoned Dol Guldur he returned to Mordor and declared himself openly. He established contact with Saruman through the Palantír captured from Minas Ithil, now Minas Morgul. In this year, Saruman also took Isengard for his own and began to fortify it.\n\nWhen Gandalf presented Saruman with the discovery and the location of the One Ring, Saruman revealed his desire for it and his secret alliance with Sauron. He had also shed the title of Saruman the White; Saruman no longer had any loyalty to the White Council, or the Ring-bearer. He tried unsuccessfully to gain Gandalf's allegiance. When Gandalf refused to join with him, Saruman held him captive in Isengard. Gandalf later escaped with help from Gwaihir the Windlord, one of Middle-earth's large Eagles, and made Saruman's treachery known to the rest of the White Council.\n\nBy one account, the Nazgûl came two days after Gandalf's escape and Saruman used his Voice to persuade the Lord of the Nazgûl that he did not know the Ring's location but that Gandalf did and they should seek him nearby. After the Nazgûl heard this they went back on the main road rode along and instead found Gríma Wormtongue (who went to tell Saruman that Gandalf had been to Edoras) who revealed that Saruman was hiding his knowledge of the Shire from them. By another account, Saruman only discovered that Gandalf had escaped when the Nazgûl arrived, he has been, according to this account, about to beg Gandalf for forgiveness and help, only to find him gone. He pretended that Gandalf was still there and had just told him the location of the Shire.\n\nThe Nazgûl later learned that Saruman knew far more than he had revealed. On their way to the Shire, the Nazgûl met one of Saruman's Shire spies, from whom they got detailed maps of the Shire made by Saruman. They sent the spy back to the Shire after warning him that he was now in the service of Mordor (the Orc-like man in the Inn of the Prancing Pony).\n\nBelieving that he would find no pity from either quarter (a false assumption, since he was later offered pardon by Gandalf); Saruman now put all efforts into obtaining the One Ring for himself. Not all of these efforts ever became known, but they included sending spies to waylay Frodo Baggins on his flight from the Shire (Bill Ferny in Bree), attacking Rohan outright with Uruk-hai, and dispatching raiding parties of Uruk-hai accompanied by Moria Orcs on likely routes the Fellowship of the Ring might take through Rohan to go towards Gondor. One of those parties captured Pippin and Merry and shot Boromir \"with many black-feathered arrows\" when he tried to defend the Hobbits. This led Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on a search which eventually led to the Battle of Helms Deep as well as the Destruction of Isengard by the Ents under Treebeard, leading to the end of Saruman's reign of power in the north.\n\nSaruman's plans failed, and he suffered a series of setbacks. Saruman's Shire network did not capture Frodo Baggins, and Éomer destroyed his only partially successful raiding party. His invasion of Rohan ended in disaster with the utter defeat of his army at the Battle of the Hornburg. Leaving Isengard undefended resulted in its destruction at the hands of the Ents (Saruman had underestimated the Ents' anger and strength).\n\nConfined to the Orthanc and with his servants scattered or killed, Saruman made one final unsuccessful attempt to turn Théoden and Gandalf over to evil. The latter then offered Saruman a chance for redemption, which involved surrendering his staff and the Keys of Orthanc as a pledge. Saruman had a moment of doubt but in the end pride, anger, and hate won over and he refused the chance of redemption.\n\nGandalf, who had returned from death to supplant Saruman, as the White and the head of the Wizard, expelled Saruman from the order and broke his staff. Saruman also lost the Palantír of Orthanc when Gríma Wormtongue threw it off a balcony of Orthanc, undecided about which he hated more, Saruman or Gandalf, and hitting neither.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Saruman"}}

In SA 3319, Ar-Pharazon set out with a great fleet intending to take the Undying Lands by force but when he set foot on the shore, Eru caused the Seas to open up. The fleet sank and Numenor was destroyed by a great wave.\n\nThe ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west sent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north, whilst Isildur and Anárion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south. Elendil and his sons established the Northern-kingdom of Arnor and the Southern-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both realms, but he dwelled in Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his sons.\n\nIsildur and Anárion had their thrones side by side in the Great Hall of Osgiliath, the city they founded on the Anduin. Anárion lived in Minas Anor on the western side of the Anduin, while Isildur made his home in Ithilien on the eastern side of the Anduin. Anárion had one of the Palantír, which he used to communicate with his brother and father.\n\nWhen Sauron and the forces of Mordor began attacking Gondor in SA 3429, Isildur and the royal family were forced to move from Minas Ithil to Annúminas in Arnor. Anárion successfully defended the city and realm and was able to drive the enemy from Ithilien. The War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of Dagorlad and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid Siege of Barad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were killed. Anárion died in SA 3440 in Mordor when a stone cast from Barad-dûr, either from falling debris or by catapult, killed him.\n\nHis father Elendil later fought Sauron, and his brother Isildur would be the one to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand with Elendil's broken sword.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/An%C3%A1rion"}}

In the film, he is knocked off a cliff by Thorin when Gandalf saved the company, and is killed after the fight through Goblin Town when Gandalf slashes his abdomen and cuts his throat, and then his corpse falls on to the company at the bottom of the cavern. (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey)"],"name":"Great Goblin","description":"The Great Goblin was a Goblin chieftain of the Misty Mountains. He was a very large creature with a huge head. He was the chief of a group of goblins who lived in Goblin-town near the High Pass. They preyed on travellers who used another, easier pass near the main gate of Goblin-town until people started avoiding that route over the mountains. The goblins then made another gate that opened into a cave that they called the Front Porch, at the top of the High Pass. The Great Goblin also sometimes ordered his goblins to catch fish for him in Gollum's Lake, and these goblins were sometimes killed by Gollum.\n\nIn the summer of TA 2941, the Dwarves of Thorin and Company, along with Bilbo Baggins, were captured on the Front Porch and were brought before the Great Goblin in his great cave, where he was seated on a flat stone and surrounded by armed guards. The Great Goblin demanded to know what the Dwarves were doing in the mountains. (He seems less hostile in this passage than the Orcs are during the later War of the Ring, as his questioning seems to imply that he has not decided beforehand whether he will order the party killed, make them slaves, or even let them go, but that he will decide according to their answers. It is also possible he was just toying with the group and would kill them afterwards.)\n\nWhen it was revealed that Thorin carried the Elvish sword Orcrist - which the Orcs and goblins fear and which they called \"Biter\" - the Great Goblin was enraged and at once leapt to attack Thorin. Immediately, all the torches in the cave were extinguished and a glowing sword \"bright as blue flame\" appeared. It was Glamdring, called \"Beater\" by the goblins, and now wielded by Gandalf. As the Dwarves were escaping, the Great Goblin leapt down in front of them, and attacked Gandalf who was at the head of the party. Gandalf then fought back, stabbing the Great Goblin and killing him.\n\nThe death of the Great Goblin angered the goblins of the Misty Mountains. A great army of goblins and Wargs was amassed by Bolg, whose father Azog had been killed by the dwarf Dáin II Ironfoot. Bolg's forces tracked Thorin and Company to the Lonely Mountain where they fought in the Battle of the Five Armies against the Dwarves, Elves, and Lakemen.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Great_Goblin"}}

For example, Ossë and Uinen, as spirits of the sea, belonged to Ulmo the Sea-King, while Curumo (known in Middle-earth as Saruman) belonged to Aulë the Smith. Others included Mairon (originally also of Aulë's people, known in Middle-earth as Sauron), Aiwendil (known in Middle-earth as Radagast), who belonged to Yavanna the Fruit-Giver, and Olórin, (known by the Elves as Mithrandir but came to Middle-Earth as Gandalf), who belonged to Manwë the Wind-King and Varda the Star-Queen. Gandalf's ways took him often to the house of Nienna the Weeper, and from her he learned pity and patience, which perhaps aided him in his later struggles to unite the Free People of Middle-earth against the power of Sauron.\n\nAlatar and Pallando, known as the Blue Wizards, travelled to the East, never returning to the West; their fate is unknown, though Tolkien wrote that they had probably also failed in their mission, but established cults in the East. The Balrogs (Valaraukar in Quenta) were associated with Melkor, and were his most trusted and terrible servants. Melian served both Vána and Estë.\n\nThe Sun and Moon are also piloted by Maiar: Arien, a spirit of fire uncorrupted by Melkor, was chosen for her radiant beauty and fierce devotion to the workings of the Valar, was chosen to guide the Sun, while Tilion, a hunter in the company of Oromë, was chosen to steer the moon.\n\nMaiar, like Valar, do not array themselves in a fixed form, but can freely change their form. Olórin, or Gandalf, walked among the several peoples of Middle-earth in an uncertain form for many years before being sent on the errand of the Valar as one of the Istari.\n\nAlso like Valar, however, this power can be lost when that power is spent in hate and mockery. Sauron, following the dark trails blazed by Melkor, took upon the form of - and remained - the Dark Lord in the Second Age. And yet, Maiar retain their immortality. From all indications, when the physical body of a Maia is destroyed, their spirit wanders houseless and their power diminished, until they are either able to take physical form once more, or are restored by their corresponding Valar. Examples of this can be seen in the threat of Luthien to Sauron upon his defeat at the Tower of Werewolves, whereby it is said:\n\n\"Ere [Sauron's] spirit left its dark house, Luthien came to him and that he should be stripped of his raiment of flesh, and his ghost sent quaking back to Morgoth; and she said 'There everlastingly thy naked self shall endure the torment of his scorn, pierced by his eyes, unless thou yield to me the mastery of thy tower.'\"\n\nFurther example includes the resurrection of Gandalf after he and the Balrog of Moria were both slain, one by the other, on the mountain peak of Zirakzigil:\n\n\"Naked I was sent back \u2013 for a brief time, until my task is done. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. There I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the earth.\"\n\nIt is not clear how, or what, restored Gandalf, though it can be inferred that Manwë played some role in it. It was Manwë, after all, that sent the Istari on their errand to check the power of Sauron in Middle Earth; therefore, by Gandalf declaring that he was sent back \"until [his] task is done\", indicates some level of Manwe's involvement; or as argued by some it was the direct intervention of Eru Ilúvatar that brought about Gandalf's return.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Maiar"}}

He was a good friend of Gandalf the Grey, whom he aided occasionally.

Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him.","Around the year 1000, the Maiar arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador upon the shores of Middle-earth, having the form of old Men, whom the peoples called Wizards. Curumo arrived first and alone, and Aiwendil arrived at the same time as Olórin.","When the Wizards took their mission they roamed Middle-earth, but Radagast was never much of a traveller. There is not much to be told about his early journeys.","By the late Third Age he eventually settled down and dwelt, for a time at least, at Rhosgobel somewhere between the Carrock and the Old Forest Road. Situated on the western borders of Mirkwood, it can be assumed that the Wizard held watch against the Shadow of Dol Guldur that slowly engulfed the forest. It is likely that he became acquainted with the inhabitants of that region. Close to animals and birds, he was friends with the Great Eagles. Although the neighboring Beorn was unsociable, he used to see him from time to time, and he considered Radagast \"not bad\" for a Wizard.","In 2851 the White Council met once more and, after that, Saruman began to search the Gladden Fields for the One Ring. Radagast decided to aid his search with birds and beasts who acted as spies hoping that Saruman's actions would help watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's real ambitions to keep the Ring for himself.","His original, Aiwendil, meant \"bird-friend\" in Quenya; IPA: [a??wendil]). It is comprised of the Quenya aiwë ([small] \"bird\") and the ending -ndil (\"friend\").","In the books, during the Council of Elrond, Gandalf refers to Radagast as \"master of shapes and changes of hue\", but the meaning of this is open to question. He was wiser than any man in all things concerning herbs and animals. It is said that he spoke many languages of birds.","It is not known when or if Radagast left Middle-earth. Tolkien writes that he forsook his mission as one of the Wizards by becoming too obsessed with animals and plants, so presumably he failed, and might not be allowed to return with honour. Tolkien also wrote that he did not believe that Radagast's failure was as great as Saruman's and that he may eventually have been allowed (or chose) to return to the Undying Lands. On the other hand, however, the primary mission of Radagast appointed by Yavanna may have actually been to watch over many of the flora and fauna of Middle-earth and to ensure their survival in the likely case if Sauron conquered Middle-earth, and in this, he succeeded.","When Tolkien finished writing the story up till Moria, he made notes on the future story development; therein he considered handing over Isengard to Radagast.","Donald Gee provided the voice of Radagast. He is introduced much earlier than in the book because his meeting with Gandalf is given chronologically.","Radagast is then seen investigating the Greenwood, noticing that much of the vegetation is beginning to decay and much of the animal life is sick or dying. Radagast brings one of them, a hedgehog he calls Sebastian, back to his woodland house at Rhosgobel where he is able to nurse the hedgehog back to health. Radagast comes to the realisation that a type of powerful witchcraft has caused the decay of the Greenwood and its transformation into what would now become known as Mirkwood. After Rhosgobel is swarmed by Giant Spiders, Radagast investigates and identifies the origin of the evil as the supposedly abandoned fortress of Dol Guldur.","Radagast is exclusive in LEGO to one set: Dol Guldur Battle. The set includes Radagast and his fellow wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and Azog and the Necromancer and two Gundabad Orcs."],"name":"Radagast","description":"Tolkien's writing does not shed much light on Radagast's personality. In the books, little is known about Radagast apart from certain defining characteristics. Saruman was the chief of the Order of Wizards and Gandalf came next in the order; Radagast meanwhile held much less power and wisdom.\n\nAs one of the Maiar of Yavanna, Radagast had a great interest in the kelvar and olvar of Middle-earth and was a friend to beasts and birds. Gandalf, however, held greater respect from, and knowledge about, birds than Radagast.\n\nRadagast displayed some qualities of innocence and naivety, making him an ideal accomplice of Saruman's plans, seen in providing his services to help the White examine the Gladden Fields.[6] Saruman in turn considered him Simple(minded), a Fool and can be heard saying that he is acting in a manner contrary to how an Istari should be.\n\nIn the films he has a eccentric personality, but is also selfless and brave, as shown when healing the hedgehog Sebastian, and in holding off an Orc pack so that Thorin & Company could go to Rivendell. He is also highly intelligent, being a Wizard, and has an adept understanding on how nature works, including performing healing spells and at magical blasts.\n\nDespite his somewhat childish ways, Radagast is also shown to be adept at combat, being able to hold his own against the resurrected Witch King of Angmar. He is also brave, and willing to help Gandalf any way he can, including rescuing him from Dol Guldur and even giving him his staff.\n\nRadagast's fidgety and slightly hyperactive speech pattern is somewhat of a trademark of actor Sylvester McCoy, who has a history of playing eccentric and comedic characters.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Radagast"}}

She once lived in Osgiliath with her family until their banishment by Denethor II, and was also betrothed to Berethor.","Little is known about Morwen's life before the events of the game. What is known is that she was born in Minis Tirith, in Gondor and her father served the steward. Some time she was betrothed to Berethor but his cowardice led to him and her being banished from Gondor. She later lived in a village in Rohan close to the forests of Fangorn with her mother, father and two brothers.","After the orcs attacked Rohan the player first sees her defending the remains of her village. She hacks one orc and as she lifts her axe in the air it kills another orc sending him reeling to the ground. As the group runs to help her she cuts down one more orc. After the conflict she jabs her axe in the lifeless body of a dead orc exclaiming on her dismay on how she can only kill them once. She then talks about how her family and friends were slain or fled this place and how she must find them.

After hearing that the battle was lost, Rían fell into despair and left Dor-lómin while still pregnant with Tuor. She would have been lost and died if not for the Sindar Elves of Mithrim who rescued her and took her to their home in the Mountains of Mithrim. Tuor was soon born and first fostered by the Grey-elves. Later, their leader Annael told his mother Rían that Huor had perished in the battle. She soon fell into grief in her early twenties and went to Haudh-En-Ndengin, the Hill of the Slain and seeing the mounds of rotting and despoiled remains, she fell sick and died.\n\nWhen the Easterlings came to claim their reward for aiding Morgoth in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, they occupied Hithlum and captured its people as their slaves. The Sindar moved their camp into the caves of Androth and it was there that Tuor spent his youth. In his sixteenth year, he grew angry with the Easterlings and their allies for the evil deeds they had done to his people and wished to fight them. Annael forbid this and Tuor obeyed. When the Elven group intended to move to the safer havens in the Mouths of Sirion through the Gate of the Noldor, Tuor went with them but the group came under attack by Orcs and scattered during the night. Tuor was captured and sent to the Easterlings and sold into slavery.\n\nTuor served the Easterling chief, the brutal Lorgan, who had been sent there by Morgoth and who cruelly oppressed the remnant of the House of Hador. He worked as a thrall for three years, at which point he had grown to his full stature, and became taller and swifter than any of the Easterlings.\n\nTuor then escaped, and lived the life of an outlaw. He travelled down Hithlum to the Cirith Ninniach, and then through the Gate of the Noldor into Nevrast. At the Gate of the Ñoldor, he met two Noldorin Elves, Gelmir and Arminas, who showed him the way into Nevrast. He spent the rest of the year in Nevrast, until he saw seven swans, and took it as a sign that he had tarried too long. He followed these swans down the coast until he reached the ruins of Vinyamar, the previous home of Turgon and his people.\n\nAt this point, the Vala Ulmo, Lord of Waters, emerged from the Belegaer and appeared to Tuor, bestowing upon him a great cloak to shield him from the eyes of his enemies, and a quest to remind Turgon of the Doom of the Ñoldor, and to warn him of the Fall of Gondolin. He also found Voronwë, an Elf of Gondolin, who had been a mariner on the last Noldorin voyage to Valinor, saved from the wrath of Ossë.\n\nTuor and Voronwë then travelled through the Fell Winter past the Pools of Ivrin, where they caught a glimpse of Tuor's cousin, Turin, wielding Gurthang, and making his way towards the wastes of Dor-lomin.\n\nPassing through the Fell Winter, Tuor and Voronwë eventually arrived in Gondolin in FA 496. Upon arriving, he proclaimed to have been sent from Ulmo with a message to Turgon. Seeing Tuor arrayed in the devices of Ulmo, he was immediately taken to see the king, where he delivered Ulmo's warning to depart; that Morgoth was coming ever closer to discovering the location of Gondolin. However, Maeglin argued against Tuor and Turgon became conflicted. For he had grown to greatly love his city, which was by now as fair as Tirion itself, and he trusted still in it's secrecy and strength. As such, he did not evacuate as Ulmo advised. However, he did not wholly disregard the wisdom of Ulmo, and decreed that none should ever pass out of the Hidden City again. He ordered the passage through the Encircling Mountains to be sealed up, and as such Tuor was forced to remain in Gondolin, though he did so gladly. Tuor rose quickly in honor in the city, being of great stature both physically and spiritually and having had the privilege of conversing directly with Ulmo. Seven years after arriving in Gondolin, Tuor fell in love with King Turgon's Elven daughter, Idril Celebrindal, who loved him in return. Turgon, who already considered Tuor as close as kin, gave the couple his blessing. They were wed in a celebration of great happiness, and soon after, their only child Eärendil the Mariner was born, who himself became the father of Elrond and Elros.\n\nIn the Book of Lost Tales, Part 2 (The History of Middle-earth, Vol. 2), the Elves in Gondolin treated Tuor very highly - \"Upon a time the king caused his most cunning artificers to fashion a suit of armour for Tuor as a great gift, and it was made of Ñoldorin steel overlaid with silver, but his helm was adorned with a device of metal and jewels like two swan-wings, one on either side, and a swan's wing was wrought on his shield\". \"A house was built for him upon the southern walls, for he loved the free airs and liked not the close neigbourhood of other dwellings. There it was his delight often to stand on the battlements at dawn, and folk rejoiced to see the new light catch the wings of his helm.\"\n\nTuor was one of the leaders of Gondolin during the Fall of Gondolin, and fought for the city during the attack by the forces of Morgoth. He achieved meritorious deeds including forcing the the great Urulókë to retreat. He also stopped attack on his wife and son by Maeglin, which he was able to thwart by throwing him from the walls into a fire. Afterwards he, his wife, their son Eärendil, and a remnant of Gondolin's people escaped through a secret way in the mountains and traveled to the Mouths of Sirion. Longing for the sea, Tuor eventually built the ship Eärrámë and sailed into the West with Idril.\n\nFaithful hero and Elf-friend he may have been, but he was still a Man and therefore mortal. However, the tradition of the Ñoldor was that when Tuor arrived with Idril in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar, he became the only Man to be accepted as one of the elder kindred, and thus shared with Beren and Lúthien, who were also granted a second life in Middle-earth, the exceptional fate of an immortal life in Valinor as long as Arda endured. Whether Eärendil ever found or saw his parents again is not known.\n\nIn The History of Middle-earth series story, Tuor and Idril reached the Tower of Pearl on one of the Enchanted Isles in the Shadowy Seas and either one or both fell asleep there for an unknown period of time.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tuor"}}

Bilbo, Gandalf, and the thirteen Dwarves, if they actually saw them, were the only ones Tolkien mentioned as ever having seen them. Their physical form was not described, nor was much else about them.\n\nGandalf used to tell stories to Bilbo when he was young at parties about dragons, goblins, giants, and rescue of princesses, and the luck of widow's sons. During the riddle game Bilbo thought of all the giants and Ogres he had heard of in tales.\n\nAt one point Bilbo saw a rock in a stream, and wondered if it had been cast miles into the plain by some giant among giants. He also compared being struck like the crash of battering-rams made of forest oaks and swung by giants.\n\nGandalf later remarked that he would like to find 'a more or less decent giant' to block several of the orc caves.\n\nGiants were only witnessed by Bilbo and the thirteen dwarves who were passing that way, and this information could only be found in the Red Book of Westmarch. Giants were also mentioned in passing at the beginning of chapter 3 of The Fellowship of the Ring. Said to be wandering in the North Moors  described as Tree-men, and being as tall as an elm tree or even taller. Sam imagined himself meeting giants that were taller than trees on the journey. There are stories by men that in the far-off glory days of Gondor the sea-kings built the Hornburg with the hands of giants. Gondor is described poetically as not appearing to have been built but carved by giants out of the bones of the earth. Pippin is also later described as a young giant with a loud voice when he returned to the Shire (for he had grown large).\n\nOne of the riders of the Mumaks the mighty warrior was a giant among the Swertings (although this may only be poetic description).\n\nFrodo thinks he sees giants when he sees the outlines of the Argonath but confirms they are only statues as he moves closer to them down the river.\n\nIn some of Tolkien's earliest writings giants were among the Uvanimor, or monster-folk, that were bred in the earth by Melkor (called Melko in the early tales) along with monsters, Nauglath (wicked dwarves), and ogres.\n\nTwo Giants were given names in The Book of Lost Tales Part Two: Gilim and Nan. In addition some of his other material there was Wade (who may be or have been based on a sea-giant of legend) and Noroth, said to be a giant.\n\nDuring the development of The Hobbit, an early draft described more traditional human-like giants;\n\nHowever, this was edited to Gandalf telling stories of '...giants and the rescue of princesses' in the final published version.\n\nThere may be a loose connection between the giants described in Farmer Giles of Ham and references to generic fairy tale giants mentioned in Hobbit tales. Farmer Giles giants are described as rude and uncultured folk, and troublesome at times, and being as large as elms and stupid. In Tolkien's earliest drafts for The Lord of the Rings, he wrote;\n\nIn the published editions, the words 'and giants' were removed.\n\nChristopher Tolkien and John Rateliff speculate that some of the various references to giants by J.R.R. Tolkien are inspired by giants from various mythology, such as fire-giants, frost-giants, hill-giants, sea-giants, and storm-giants.\n\nGiants appear in the first of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. These stone giants were depicted as fighting each other as well as throwing rocks. They appeared as hewn from stone, and as the size of mountains - indistinguishable from a cliff-face when still. This is somewhat reminiscent of the more tree-like design of the Ents in the previous trilogy, with the giants appearing more inspired by nature than by humanoid appearance.\n\nTolkien's giants were probably based on the Jotun of Norse mythology which are similar in strength and bestial.\n\nJohn Rateliff notes in The History of the Hobbit;\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Giants"}}

In human form, he appeared as a, tall, black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. Beorn kept many animals at his residence, such as horses, dogs and unicorns. His animals were all extremely intelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while carrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak. Beorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was also capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could communicate with bears.

Some of those nearby attuned their music to his, until two musical themes were warring before the Throne. To correct the Discord, Eru introduced a Second, and then a Third Theme into the music. But Melkor succeeded in holding back the Second theme, of which Manwë was the chief instrument. The Third was the theme of Elves and Men, and while it was not overwhelmed by the Discord as the Second theme was, it too failed to correct it. When Eru brought the Music to an end, he rebuked Melkor, praising his strength but reminding him that, as an aspect of his creator's thought, anything that Melkor could bring into being ultimately had its source within Eru himself. As such, even the Discord redounded in the end to the glory of Eru's work. This rebuke shamed Melkor, but brought on anger in him as well, though he hid it. Thus when the Music was made incarnate as Arda, it was already flawed through the Discord, and immoderate heat and great cold stalked it. Melkor then took in the interest of the World and descended to it with the other Valar.","When the Valar entered into Arda and began to shape the unwrought matter, Melkor saw the Field of Arda and claimed it for his own. However, the other Valar took Manwë to be their lord, for while Manwë was not nearly so powerful as Melkor, he understood the thought of Eru better than any of his peers. Bitter, Melkor set himself against the other Valar. Whenever the Valar worked to better the world, Melkor disrupted their efforts. For a long while, Melkor fought alone against the might of all the other Valar and Maiar of Arda, and he long held the upper hand. During this time, Arda was kept essentially shapeless, as Melkor ruined virtually every early work that the other Valar attempted to create. Fortunately for them, the mighty Valar Tulkas eventually descended to Arda, and his strength tipped the balance in favor of the Valar. Melkor fled before him, and left Arda for a time.","After Melkor's departure, the Valar managed to quiet the tumults of the world, and set about ordering it in preparation for the coming of the Elves. To give light to the world, they constructed two Great Lamps in Middle-earth and set their place of dwelling in the midst of them. During this time, Melkor re-entered Arda with the various Maiar spirits who had attuned themselves to his music, and delved a mighty fortress at the very north-most part of the World and named it Utumno. To defend it he raised the Mountains of the East in the northeast of Middle-earth, east of the Sea of Helcar. Decay arose in the North, and the Valar thus knew that Melkor had returned. Before they could begin to search for him however, Melkor came forth from Utumno with sudden war, and cast down the Lamps. The fire within the Lamps scorched a great portion of the world, and containing the catastrophe caused by their breaking kept the Valar occupied long enough for Melkor and his forces to retreat back to Utumno.","Over a long period of time he spread lies concerning the intentions of the Valar in bringing the Elves to Aman, telling them, among other things, tales of the coming of Men, the existence of which the Valar had not revealed to the Elves. Due to his carefully crafted lies, many of the Ñoldor began to believe that the Valar had brought them to Aman so that Men might inherit Middle-earth, taking the lands and the glory that could have been theirs. Eventually, a shadow fell upon the Ñoldor, and they began to openly rebel against the Valar. Chief amongst the disgruntled Noldor was Fëanor, the firstborn son of the Ñoldor King Finwë. Though he hated and feared Melkor, his overwhelming pride caused him to be the most vocal of the Ñoldor in expressing discontent. For their part, the Valar remained unaware of Melkor's work, and saw Fëanor as the source of the Ñoldor's unrest. Though perturbed, they let the situation continue until Fëanor threatened his brother Fingolfin with violence, at which point the Valar summoned him to the Ring of Doom in Valinor to explain his unlawful actions.","One hundred years later, Morgoth sent an army into the north to approach Hithlum from the side, but an army under the command of Fingon destroyed them yet again. At this point, Morgoth came to realize that the orcs unaided were no match for the Ñoldor, and began experimenting with ways to create deadlier creatures for his armies. Another century passed, and the issuing of the first dragon, Glaurung, demonstrated the results of Morgoth's long labor. Glaurung's sudden appearance scattered the elves in the immediate vicinity of Angband, but a company of archers under Fingon's command engaged him before he could do much more than frighten the elves. As Glaurung was barely half-grown, his hide was not yet invulnerable to the elven arrows and he fled the field. Morgoth was displeased with Glaurung for revealing himself before his creator had planned, but ultimately Glaurung's youthful foray was of little consequence.","Fingolfin's last stroke gave Morgoth a permanent limp, and the pain of his seven wounds could not be healed, nor were the scars ever erased.","All Morgoth's court was cast down in slumber by her song, but the Silmarils burned, and became so heavy that the head of Morgoth sagged upon his chest. He fell from his throne, the Iron Crown rolled away from him, and Beren cut a Silmaril from it. However, rather than leaving immediately with his prize, he tried to take another of the Silmarils. As he attempted to pry the second jewel loose, his knife snapped. One shard struck Morgoth's face, and he began to awaken. Beren and Lúthien fled in terror, but were not chased as Morgoth and his court had not yet woke. However, at the gates of Angband the werewolf Carcharoth was aware of them, and later bit off Beren's hand, and took with it the Silmaril. Burning from the inside at the touch of the holy jewel, Carcharoth went mad and fled in wrath from Angband, slaughtering all who stood in his path. Then Morgoth awoke, and in a rage he and his court roared up in pursuit, only to see Thorondor carrying off the raiders. Morgoth's rage at the loss of the Silmaril caused the Iron Mountains to begin erupting, terrifying all those who could see it. Ultimately however, he was unable to recover the gem.","Soon after, Morgoth became aware that Maedhros was making a great league against him, and driving his orcs off the northern heights. As such, he took council against them and prepared his forces for a major confrontation. When the elves eventually made it to Angband, the Battle of Nirnaeth Arnoediad began. Ultimately, the battle was a complete and decisive victory for Morgoth. The power of the elves and their Edain compatriots to make war against Morgoth was utterly and permanently broken. All of the great kingdoms of the Noldor in Beleriand besides Gondolin, were destroyed, and Hithlum was at last taken as well. The Edain who did not flee were enslaved by Easterlings, and Húrin was taken captive.","From a distance Morgoth put the son and daughter of Húrin, Turin and Nienor, under a species of diabolic oppression: his thought followed them and gave them bad luck, though they were not possessed. By this means he drove them at last to madness and despair; though there is doubt as to whether in the extremity of his malice he cheated himself, as their madness saved them from damnation.","Though he had been unable to force Húrin to reveal the location of the last great elven kingdom, Morgoth eventually captured Maeglin, sister-son of Turgon, the King of Gondolin. Threatened with unimaginable torment, Maeglin offered the secrets of Gondolin's defenses in exchange for his own well-being. Additionally, he made a promise to kill Tuor personally, and was given permission by Morgoth to take Idril for himself. Having lusted after Idril for decades, Morgoth's offer secured Maeglin's loyalty, and he became the Dark Lord's willing servant. After learning all he could from Maeglin, Morgoth sent him back to Gondolin to aid the invasion from within when the time came.","Morgoth was utterly defeated and stood at bay, but was yet unvaliant. He fled into the deepest of his mines and sued for peace and pardon, but his feet were hewn from under him, and he was cast upon his face. He was bound with the chain Angainor, his Iron Crown was beaten into a collar for his neck, and he was thrust through the Door of Night into the Timeless Void. The two remaining Silmarils were recovered from him, though shortly thereafter they were again lost.","Melkor's lies, sowed in the hearts of Elves and Men, spawned a seed that did not die and could not be destroyed, but ever and anon sprouted anew, and bore dark fruit ever after.Sauron, his most powerful servant, remained loyal to his master's memory. After his first defeat during the Second Age, Sauron was held prisoner in Numenor, but managed to corrupt the king, Ar-Pharazôn, and several of his followers, into worshiping Melkor as a god.","However, the published Silmarillion does not include this information, and instead asserts that, if the Valar know how the end of Arda will present itself, they have not revealed it.","The name Melkor was a Quenya word that meant \"One who arises in Might\"; his name in Sindarin was Belegûr or Belegurth (\"Great Death\").","His Old English name is Manfréa Bolgen, from the Old English words man (\"evil, wickedness\"), fréa (\"lord\"), and bolgen (\"wrathful\").","He was the world's first Dark Lord. Melkor was also known for giving himself titles and referred to himself as King of the World and the Elder King. After his defeat, his most powerful servant Sauron called him Lord of All and Giver of Freedom and Lord of the Dark as a way of getting the corrupted Númenóreans to worship him.","Material in The Lost Road and Other Writings refers to him as Melko, Alkar, and Mardello.","He casually tanked energy from the Silmarils , which had the energy of at the very least thousands of stars blasting him with their light every second.","In other writings, it was said that Melkor wanted to claim the Maia Arien as his wife and ravished her, to \"destroy and disdain her, not to beget any fiery offspring\"."],"name":"Melkor","description":"Initially, Melkor could take on any form he chose. The Ainur took on forms reflective of their moods and might. Melkor, in his arrogance, malice and power, took on a form recorded as:\n\nIt is said that out of all the Valar, Melkor was most like Aulë for his craftsmanship. Originally the brightest, most beautiful, most powerful Ainu, he fell through jealousy, pride and hatred of others, into Darkness with ever after a desire to conquer and to rule. When he built Utumno he took on a form shaped roughly manlike but great in size, \"a Dark Lord, tall and terrible.\" This form was chained by the Valar. When he walked in Valinor he wore a much fairer form, so noble and lofty and benevolent not even the Elves (save only Fëanor and Galadriel) are recorded as seeing through it to the malice underneath. This he cast off to escape unclad from the hunt of the Valar, and when he faced Ungoliant he put back on the form of the tyrant of Utumno. In that form he remained ever after. As he spent his might and poured out his power into the very fabric of matter, as well as into all his creations, he grew more stooped and less majestic, and his hands were burned black from the touch of the Silmarils. His eyes shone with a daunting light.\n\nThere is some dispute over Morgoth's size. The Silmarillion states:\n\nAs Elves typically reached about six feet tall, or close to seven feet for the Noldor, (Men were of similar height to Elves, however, Númenóreans averaged was similar with those Noldor elves and Elendil was said to be nearly eight)... Morgoth must have stood at least twice this length, and with the shadow he robed himself in he may well have seemed taller. In most artistic renderings Morgoth is depicted as towering over other beings, most notably elves (Fingolfin in particular) of the FA.\n\nThis again implies a huge size. It may be wondered how Fingolfin stayed alive so long; but Elves were possessed of a strength and agility many times greater than a human (save exceptional ones like Turin), and Fingolfin could probably leap to great heights.\n\nInitially, Melkor's power was so great that he could contend with all the other Valar and Maiar of Arda and beat them (ere Tulkas came). Over time however, his power was dispersed into the fabric of Arda and into his servants, lessening his might. At the time of his visit to Fëanor at Formenos, Melkor was still referred to as \"the greatest being in Eä\", though this was before his capture and final defeat by the Valar. It is unknown how much of his power he put into his various slaves after returning to Angband.\n\nIn terms of his personality, perhaps his most defining attribute was his overweening pride. From nearly the beginning of his existence, Melkor wished to have the power of creation, a power that only Eru Ilúvatar possessed. When he discovered that he would never be able to possess it, and that all that he could accomplish had, by definition, it's utmost source in Ilúvatar himself, he began to decend into anger and bitterness. When Arda came into being, he desired lordship of it for the sake of his own self aggrandizement rather than for the sake of ordering it according to the will of Ilúvatar. When he was denied it, he began to squander his gifts in wasteful and wanton destructiveness, using his wast power to ruin the works of the other Valar. He also envied anyone who possessed anything in greater quantity than himself, and that which he could not control, he grew eventually to hate. He began with a desire for light, but when he could not possess it for himself alone, he turned instead to darkness. His power and knowledge, both of which were greater than all the other Valar, he perverted to manipulation and deception, and he became an absolute and consummate liar. Ever denied the lordship and worship he so coveted, he squandered his power in fashioning evil servants who would give him these things, dispersing himself, his power, and his malice into the very fabric of Arda. Despite his overwhelming might, he was also known to be remarkably cowardly, reluctant to engage in battle himself even when victory was completely assured. Part of this was due to the fact that, alone of the Valar, he eventually became bound to a physical form which could be destroyed. He was possessed of virtually peerless cunning, and he was able to deceive and manipulate even the other Valar to the point where, after he was released from the Halls of Mandos, he was above the suspicion of all save Tulkas and Ulmo, and this was primarily because they were slow to forgive his past transgressions. Many of his most terrible deeds in Arda were achieved through treachery, manipulation, misdirection, and lies, and he seduced many Maiar to his service with false promises. However, as an utterly pitiless and merciless being, acts of compassion, mercy, or pity were entirely beyond his comprehension, and he seemed to have a serial tendency to underestimate the valor and capabilities of his foes.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Melkor"}}

He was considered the High King of the Elves in Middle-earth. He formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men with Elendil, and he led the Elves, who were undivided, to war against Sauron during this time. His death marked the end of the Ñoldor Kingdoms in Middle-earth, though many Ñoldor still dwelt in Imladris throughout the Third Age.","Gil-galad was a Sindarin word that means \"Star of Radiance\" , from gil (\"star\") and galad (\"light, radiance\").","In Fellowship of the Ring, Gil-galad's (played by Mark Ferguson) death scene was deleted, however he makes a brief appearance when he fights multiple orcs with his spear. He also appears very briefly as one of the original three Elven ring-bearers (along with Galadriel and Círdan) wearing Vilya.","Gil-galad's armor was similar in composition to that of all the elves of the Second Age: a cuirass and fault of interlocking lames of steel plate over a hauberk of fine mail, together with pauldrons and braces. However, befitting his status as High-king, his armor was blued and etched with vine like tracery, and the plates were embossed with Tengwar symbols and included leather pants, which gave greater protection. At the throat, he wore a steel collar that bore his heraldic insignia, twelve stars on a midnight blue field. The color blue may have reflected an association with the sea; in any case, it was certainly a dye that was rare on Middle-earth, and it would have required a great deal of time and knowledge to locate enough flora or fauna with which to make it. His cloak was of a deep blue and his armor was golden, and instead of a helmet, he wore a golden crown, fashioned for him by Celebrimbor, who made the Rings of Power.","The shield of the High-king was the same shape as the common Elven shield, but like his armor it was more richly adorned: it was enameled in blue on and around the center jewel and decorated in gold with the twelve stars of his house. Because Aeglos, his great spear, was wielded two-handed, it is likely that the shield was carried only to the field of battle rather onto it, to be left with one of Gil-galad's attendants. It may have been used by him when he fought with a sword."],"name":"Gil-galad","description":"Gil-galad was most likely born in the fifth century of the First Age and was still young during the times of the battles of the Dagor Bragollach and Nirnaeth Arnoediad. He was the son of Fingon in the official text of the Silmarillion, which tied him into the House of Fingolfin. In the other version of the legendarium, he was the son Orodreth, and the brother of Finduilas. He lived in Nargothrond until its fall and escaped, and eventually came to the Mouths of Sirion.\n\nAfter the death of Turgon during the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad received the Kingship of the Ñoldor. When the Sons of Feanor committed the Third Kinslaying, Gil-galad received word of the sacking of the Havens, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the Sons of Feanor, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of Sirion joined with Gil-galad and went with him to Balar, where they told him of Elrond and Elros' captivity. After the War of Wrath, the remaining Sons of Feanor vanished out of history. Maedhros committed suicide while Maglor disappeared without a trace, leaving Elrond and Elros alone. Therefore at some point Gil-galad welcomed Elrond into his ranks, after the latter chose to be one of Elf Kind.\n\nIn year 1 of the Second Age, Gil-galad remained in Middle-earth and established Lindon, which was strong and secure against its enemies. At its height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains and the western parts of Greenwood the Great, though most of the Eldar remained in Lindon and in Elrond's refuge of Rivendell.\n\nGil-galad had an alliance with the Men of Westernesse, especially with Tar-Aldarion (the Mariner), The Faithful and Elendil. Gil-galad reigned as High King of the Ñoldor throughout the Second Age. During this time Gil-galad was given the seeds of mellyrn, or mallorn, trees by Tar-Aldarion, who was, during this time, High King of Numenor. But the seeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to Galadriel before she left Lindon. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting them in Lindórinand. When they grew in the land, it was renamed Lothlórien, Lórien of Blossom. At some point, Gil-galad and Elrond were approached by a stranger called Annatar, who called himself the Lord of Gifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Gil-galad perceived that this Annatar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused to have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Elves that they should shun this stranger.\n\nHowever Annatar was received in Eregion, where he taught the Elves how to make the Rings of Power. But Gil-galad's distrust was proven correct, as Annatar was Sauron in disguise, and the rings were tools for his wicked plans to dominate Middle-earth. Later on, Gil-galad was entrusted by Celebrimbor with the Elven Rings Vilya (Ring of Air) and Narya (Ring of Fire), two of the Three Rings, which he passed on to his herald Elrond and his lieutenant Cirdan prior to his demise at the Siege of Barad-dûr.\n\nFor a long time Gil-galad waged war with Sauron. But the High King was aided by the Numenoreans, then ruled by Tar-Minastir, which hindered Sauron's forces. Sauron, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned to Mordor, where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance against the Dunedain. He was later confronted by the Numenoreans and brought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Gil-galad free to rule Middle-Earth in peace. In Sauron's absence, Gil-galad's power grew to the point where Sauron was dismayed when he returned from the ruin of Numenor. Yet the survivors of Numenor, known as the Faithful, arrived in Middle-Earth and established their kingdoms. They retained their friendship with the Elves, and both Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel as to how they should deal with Saruon. At length they decided to gather all of their hosts and attack Sauron before he could recover his strength.\n\nWith the emergence of Sauron, Gil-galad joined forces with the King Elendil to defeat the might of Mordor, reborn again with the return of Sauron. Their large, well-trained, united forces engaged Sauron's armies multiple times in the conflict known as the War of the Last Alliance. Gil-galad's famed weapon was a spear named Aeglos - which meant \"Icicle\"; none could withstand it. Finally, towards the end of the war, the Elves and Men passed through into Mordor and laid siege to Barad-dûr, where Gil-galad and Elendil dueled Sauron himself. During their struggle, Gil-galad and Elendil inflicted enough mortal wounds on the Dark Lord to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds in return. This sacrifice allowed Isildur to sever the Ring from the Dark Lord's hand. But Gil-galad received severe burns from \"the heat of Sauron's hand\", and so he passed on to the Halls of Mandos. He was not known to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the Ñoldor ended in Middle-earth and Círdan was from then on the Lord of the Grey Havens and Lindon.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gil-galad"}}

If this were true, Halbarad would have been well over 90 years old when he fell in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, and there is no indication that he belongs to the House of Elros. (He was a descendant, like all Dunedain, of the Numenoreans and the gift of long life was given to Numenor, not to Elros solely, and so Halbarad could have been older than Aragorn and still in his middle years.)","Halbarad appears in the recent video game Lord of the Rings: War in the North as the leader of the Dúnedain guarding the Shire camped at Sarn Ford.

He said of the Hobbits, \"A little people, but of great worth are the Shire-folk. Little do they know of our long labor for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet I grudge it not.\"\n\nIn response to a message sent to Rivendell by Galadriel, Halbarad led the Grey Company comprised of 30 Dúnadan south to the aid of their kinsman Aragorn. Aragorn rejoiced at their coming, and Théoden remarked thus; \"It is well! If these kinsmen be in any way like yourself, my Lord Aragorn, thirty such knights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.\"\n\nWith them also rode Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond. They caught up with Aragorn near the Fords of Isen in Rohan in the early hours of March 6, 3019. Halbarad brought Aragorn a message from Arwen as well as a standard made by her, which Aragorn asked Halbarad to keep for him for a while.\n\nHalbarad accompanied Aragorn to a chamber high in the Hornburg where Aragorn looked into the Palantir and revealed himself to Sauron. That morning Aragorn decided to take the Paths of the Dead, down the Dimholt Road, under the White Mountains and Halbarad and the Grey Company went with him, along with Legolas and Gimli. When they reached the entrance at daybreak on March 8, Halbarad said, \"This is an evil door, and my death lies beyond it. I will dare to pass it nonetheless...\"\n\nAt midnight at the Stone of Erech, Aragorn summoned the Dead to fulfill their oaths and Halbarad unfurled Aragorn's standard, which appeared black with no device in the darkness.

Aragorn dismissed the Dead, and the Grey Company sailed up the Anduin.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Pelennor Fields on March 15 in the midst of the battle, Aragorn's standard was once again unfurled but now it was seen to bear the emblem of the White Tree of Gondor and the Seven Stars and Crown of Elendil.

Hanging from the harness were ropes that the Haradrim used to climb up into the frame and take up their positions on the platforms. Their elevated position allowed them to target an otherwise hidden enemy and gave their arrows and spears a greater range.\n\nIn South Harad during the Third Age there lived beasts of vast bulk that are thought to be ancestors of elephants. Yet the elephants that now inhabit the world are much smaller in size and might than their great ancestors. According to the Red Book, they were between 40 and 50 feet (12 and 15 meters) tall with four gigantic tusks and two lesser ones. The Haradrim often used war paint on their Mûmakil, to make them more fearsome.\n\nIn the years of the War of the Ring, the fierce warriors of Harad came north to Gondor at the call of Sauron, and with their legions they brought the great mûmakil, which they used as beasts of war. The twenty Mûmakil that the Haradrim brought to Pelennor were harnessed with the gear of war: red banners, bands and trappings of gold and brass, and on their backs great war towers from which archers and spearmen fought. They had a natural blood-lust, and many foes were crushed beneath their feet. With their trunks they struck down many foes, and their tusks were red with the blood of their enemies. They could not be fought effectively by mounted men, for horses refused to go near them, nor by footmen, who were quickly crushed or shot from above. In war, they would frequently stand as towers that could not be captured; shield walls broke before them and armies were routed around them.\n\nThese thick-skinned beasts were almost invulnerable to arrows; their eyes were vulnerable, however, as Mûmakil could be blinded or even killed by arrows released with great force. When blinded they went into a rage of pain, often destroying masters and foes alike in their rampages. The tendons in their legs seem to be a vulnerable point however, as several had been taken down by being hamstrung during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Very few Mûmakil were seen after the War of the Ring outside of Far Harad, their natural habitat. It is presumed wild Mûmakil still roamed in Far Harad and that some still were kept by the Haradrim.\n\nThe word Oliphaunt is a variant spelling of the archaic word oliphant meaning \"elephant\", \"ivory\", \"elephant-tusk\", \"musical horn made of an elephant tusk\", or \"a musical instrument resembling such a horn\". It appears in Middle English as olifant or olifaunt, and was borrowed from Medieval French olifanz. The French word owes something to both Old High German olbenta \"camel\", and to Latin elephantus \"elephant\", a word of Greek origin. OHG olbenta is a word of old Germanic origin; cf. Gothic ulbandus also meaning \"camel\". However, the form of the OHG and Gothic words suggests it is also a borrowing, perhaps indeed directly or indirectly from Greek elephas \"??????\" Greek for ivory, though apparently with some confusion as to the animal the word referred to. The word survives as the surname Oliphant found throughout the English-speaking world. Olifant is also the Dutch word for elephant.\n\nThe most famous use of the oliphant is in The Song of Roland \"The oliphant is set to Roland's Lips;\" Roland fails to call for help at the Battle of Roncevaux in 778 until it is too late for him and his comrades. The oliphant is echoed in The Lord of the Rings by Boromir's Horn of Gondor and counterpoised by Helm's horn and the horns of Buckland.  In Middle-earth, the Men of Gondor called an oliphaunt a mûmak (plural mûmakil). The word \"Oliphaunt\" is only used by hobbits.\n\nOliphaunt is also the title of a short comic poem about the beast quoted by the hobbit Samwise Gamgee, based on traditional bestiary lore.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, virtually the Haradrim managed to attach the great bamboo and canvas war harness to its back. The bands of bamboo spikes seen on several Mûmakil during the battle.\n\nIn Return of the King's Pelennor Fields level, you have to kill 2 to a multitude of Mûmakil (depending on how much you are able to damage the Witch-king each round). They cannot be damaged by melee means, and have to be taken out with arrows or thrown spears. There is also one featured in the Southern Gate level.\n\nIn Battle for Middle-earth 1 and 2, the Mordor faction can build 'Mûmakil'. Mûmakil can be considered the strongest regular unit, with their powers only overshadowed by a few heroes and summoned units.The Mûmak is highly resilient against melee attacks, can easily kill most humanoid units, including heroes, by walking over them and has the ability to initiate short sprints, which trample everything in its path. Another useful ability is that ranged units, such as Orc Achers and Haradrim Spear throwers can mount the Mûmak and fire while it is moving. While seemingly invincible, the Mûmak in these games still has a few weaknesses. It can be easily defeated from a distance by archers equipped with flaming arrows and is heavily damaged when attempting to walk over spearmen\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: Conquest, three Oliphaunts must be killed before they reach the defense zone. In the Pelennor Fields level of the War of the Ring campaign, they can be killed easily with a catapult or by sabotage. They can be controlled on the Rise of Sauron level Weathertop or in the Pelennor Fields level (in Instant action) (Team Deathmatch mode only).\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, Mumakil are enemies in Pelennor Fields in Good Mode and are playable in Pelennor Fields Evil Mode.\n\nUncanonical to Lord of the Rings, the game Rome: Total War includes a cheat entered as \"Oliphaunt,\" which creates a unit of \"Yubtseb Elephants,\" massive elephants who greatly resemble Mûmakil. Their name is \"Best Buy\" spelled backwards, and are said to be the offspring of the fictional god \"G'nitek'ram, The God of Shiny Objects Man Does Not Need but Desires Anyway,\" G'nitek'ram being \"marketing\" spelled backwards.\n\nThe game Rome; Total War does include a mod of the Lord of the Rings called \"The Lord of The Rings: Total War\", and the Mûmakil are a unit for the Haradrim army and another unit called the greater Mûmakil are a used as a bodyguard for the general.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/M%C3%BBmakil"}}

It is actually of Dwarvish origin (or Sindarized Khuzdul) from the word felak-gundu (\"Hewer of Caves\").","The earlier name for Finrod, as told in The History of Middle-earth, was Inglor Felagund.","In earlier versions of the Middle-earth myths and in the first edition of The Lord of the Rings, the name Finrod was given to the character later known as Finarfin. Finrod Felagund was then named \"Inglor Felagund\". Because of that, some people speculate that Gildor Inglorion was Finrod's son, but there is much evidence to the contrary, which is found on the page for Gildor Inglorion."],"name":"Finrod","description":"Finrod was friendly with Turgon and the House of Fingolfin. He opposed Fëanor and the Oath when he sought to return to Middle-earth to recover the Silmarils from Morgoth, but chose not to be parted with his friends and so he followed his father and his House and the House of Fingolfin. Finrod did not fight in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë nor was he aware of it as he continued the transit through Araman. While marching up the coast, the host encountered a figure on a rock and heard the Prophecy of the North. Afterwards, Finarfin and many of his followers departed and returned to Tirion, but Finrod chose to continue onto Middle-earth with the host of Fingolfin.\n\nFinrod founded the original Minas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion. In around FA 50, he and his friend Turgon, while journeying down the river Sirion, encamped along its banks and were laid to rest by Ulmo. While asleep, Ulmo revealed to them the hidden realm of Nargothrond and the valley of Tumladen. Finrod discovered the system of caves beneath the Taur-en-Faroth, protected by the Nagrod and the power of Ulmo, and here went on to found his own kingdom and become Lord of Nargothrond.\n\nWhile hunting in the lands of Thargelion in East Beleriand, Finrod was first of the Ñoldor to come across Men. He stayed with them long, learning their language and teaching them Sindarin. He also intervened on behalf of the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, who feared Men would destroy their home, and he received the permission of King Thingol, who held rule over all Beleriand, to guide the Men to Estolad.\n\nFinrod had a close friendship with Andreth of the House of Bëor, whom he often visited during the Siege of Angband to converse with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth.\n\nDuring the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir of the House of Bëor saved Finrod's life, and in friendship Finrod gave him his ring. This ring was later known as the Ring of Barahir and was eventually handed down to Aragorn when told of his true identity. Years after the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir's son Beren came to Nargothrond seeking help, and Finrod went with him on the Quest of the Silmaril to repay his debt, laying down his kingship. Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Nargothrond at the time, persuaded (using fear of Morgoth, and barely veiled threats related to their Oath) most of Nargothrond to stay behind; only ten warriors, headed by one, Edrahil, were faithful and accompanied their King.\n\nThough disguised by the arts of Finrod, the twelve were captured by Sauron and taken to Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Minas Tirith, the castle Felagund himself had built. Finrod and Sauron battled with songs of power but despite a great display of skill and power by the Elven prince, Sauron eventually caught him in a devious trap and prevailed. But Sauron could not discern who exactly they were, even though they were revealed to him. Sauron imprisoned them, seeking to learn their errand and identities, sending a werewolf to devour them one by one until they revealed their secret, yet none did. Sauron however perceived that Finrod was a High Elven Lord of great power, and purposed to save him for last. Eventually, when the wolf came for Beren, Finrod burst his chains and killed the wolf barehanded but was mortally wounded himself.\n\nFinrod loved Amarië, a Vanyarin Elf, who didn't follow him to Middle-earth. For this, though she and Finrod were betrothed, Finrod never married while in Middle-earth. It is noted in the Lay of Leithian that Finrod was soon allowed to return to life in Valinor and \"now dwells with Amarië\" and was described as walking \"with Finarfin his father beneath the trees in Eldamar\". Even though Mandos foretold that any of the exiles who died would never be allowed to leave his halls, Finrod alone was allowed to reembody in Valinor.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Finrod"}}

Their first dwellings had been Utumno, but after their master's defeat during the War for Sake of the Elves, the Balrogs and other creatures in Melkor's service escaped and went to Angband.\n\nBalrogs were present as early as the Years of the Trees when Melkor and Ungoliant went to Valinor and destroyed the Two Trees. By then, the Balrogs remained in the pits of Angband. After Morgoth destroyed the Trees with Ungoliant, he came to the ruins of Angband to renew his rule in Middle-earth. A disagreement with Ungoliant led to her attacking him, and Morgoth gave out a great cry that roused the Balrogs from their slumber. In a tempest of fire, the Balrogs drove Ungoliant away and prepared to pursue her. However, they were halted by Morgoth and returned to Angband, which shortly thereafter was constructed anew.\n\nWhen Noldor managed to win the battle Dagor-nuin-Giliath,  Fëanor, still in a great rage, pressed on toward Angband. He came even within sight of Angband, but was ambushed by a force of Balrogs, with few elves about him. Soon he stood alone, but long he fought on with all Balrogs alone, so how was mightiest the strength, valour, and endurance, of all the Children of Iluvatar, though he was wrapped in fire and wounded with many wounds. But at the last Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs, smote him to the ground, inflicting a mortal wound.\n\nMaedhros, Fëanor's son, persuaded the forces of Morgoth for a feigned treaty, but Morgoth sent his Balrogs. The entire company was slain, except for Maedhros, who was later brought to Angband.\n\nYears later, during the Dagor Bragollach, the Balrogs, along with Glaurung and Orcs, were issued forth from Angband assault the fortresses of the Elves and to kill their allies, the Men.\n\nThe Balrogs fought during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, where Gothmog led the invasion. He threw aside Húrin and Turgon, turned upon Fingon and killed him with the help of another Balrog, securing the field for Morgoth's forces. He also captured Húrin, after Húrin was buried under a mountain of slain foes. He bound the human warrior and delivered him to Angband, whereupon Morgoth attempted unsuccessfully to pry the location of Gondolin from him.\n\nIn FA 510, during the Fall of Gondolin, the Balrogs rode upon the backs of dragons to reach the hidden city of Gondolin. The Lord of the House of the Fountain, Ecthelion, managed to kill Gothmog at the cost of his own life. While attempting to escape the burning city, Glorfindel and his companions were blocked by another Balrog. To save Tuor, Idril and their young son Eärendil, Glorfindel fought the Balrog on a cliff and cast it down, but he was pulled down with the Balrog to their deaths.\n\nThe last of the Balrogs fought in the War of Wrath and were destroyed, though some managed to escape and hide in the caverns of the earth.\n\nIn TA 1980, a Balrog awoke in Moria when the Dwarves had mined too deep for Mithril. It drove the Dwarves out of their home and slew King Durin VI, and the Balrog was thereafter called \"Durin's Bane\".\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, the Fellowship of the Ring passed through Moria and encountered Durin's Bane, which pursued them to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. Gandalf the Grey fought the Balrog, allowing the Fellowship to escape Moria. Both fell into the abyss, but the battle continued at the peak of Zirakzigil. Finally, it ended, but both Gandalf and Durin's Bane were slain in the process. Gandalf was later \"sent back\" by the Valar, as Gandalf the White.\n\nBalrogs generally took the form of a tall, menacing being roughly in the shape of a Man, though seeming to consist or be surrounded by shadow. They had two large black wings that can stretch between two pillars, thus being about twenty feet long. They use both a flaming sword, and a many thronged whip. They are constantly burning, and all their weapons appear to be made of lava. Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs in the First Age, used a black axe as well. They induced great terror in friends and foes alike. Many who faced Balrogs referred to them as monsters consisting purely of shadow and flame.\"\n\nBalrogs seemed to encapsulate and project power and terror, perhaps meant to be a dark shadow of the majesty that the Valar radiate. Additionally, Tolkien refers to Balrogs with \"streaming fiery manes\".\n\nAdditionally, they may have been able to alter their body structures on occasion, as in the battle between Durin's Bane and Gandalf, when the Balrog fell into a body of water he shifted himself into something slimy. However, it is also possible that this alternate form was simply Gandalf using colorful language to describe what the Balrog was like after having its flame extinguished and being covered in water. It is also possible that, while the Balrog, like all other Ainur, could shift form, this was not a case of that.\n\nBalrogs were exceptionally powerful creatures. Only seven Balrogs at most were powerful enough to drive away Ungoliant, a monster powerful enough to devour at the least thousand of star-level fruits, and consume the fruits of Telperion, which produced the light for billions of stars.\n\nA single Balrog, who became known as Durin's Bane, managed to singlehandedly drive the Dwarves of Moria from their ancient fastness, which was at the time the greatest kingdom of Dwarves that had ever been. He also contended with Gandalf, who shattered the side of a mountain with physical might alone. The Balrogs were considerably bodily agile, such that their passing is once described as a \u201Ctempest of fire\u201D.\n\nGothmog fought against and overcame Fëanor, an elf who was powerful enough to control the light of the two trees, and was the strongest elf in history. He also spread chaos through the city of Gondolin, filled with elves of similar, though far lower, caliber. He was even thought to be at least somewhat comparable to Sauron during the first age.\n\nIn Sindarin, the word Balrog means \"Demon of Might\", from the words bal (\"power\") and raug, rog (\"demon\"). Balrogs are called Valarauko or Valaraukar in Quenya, from the words vala (\"power\") and rauco (\"demon\").\n\nIn other writings, Balrog is derived from ñgwalaraukô (\"demon\").\n\nIn Tolkien's later writings, he made note of the fact that there could not have ever been more than seven Balrogs, yet they were able to drive away Ungoliant in what was described as a \"tempest of fire\".\n\nIn another early writing, the Lord of the Balrogs was named Lungorthin. It is unknown whether it is another name for Gothmog, but Christopher Tolkien thinks it is probably, since the name Gothmog was already mentioned in the earliest writings about Middle-earth.\n\nInitially, the Balrogs were often described to be immense in numbers:\n\nIn later writings, however, Christopher Tolkien notes that:\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Balrog"}}

Originally the styled themselves as \"King's Men\" and persecuted The \"Elf-friends\" because of their loyalty to the Valar (The King's Men had grown jealous of the elves' immortality) and after Saurons arrival to Númenor they begun worshipping Melkor and the darkness they so feared, bringing human sacrifices to him.

It was said that the name \"Thranduil\" was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Sindarin names such as Legolas, Nimrodel, and Amroth among others.","Thranduil first appears as a character in The Hobbit, where he is not named. Tolkien refers to him as the elf-king or the king, and also by the titles Elvenking and King of the Elves of the Wood. The name Thranduil first appears in The Lord of the Rings, in which his title was given as the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. Elsewhere in Tolkien's writings he was also referred to as King of the Woodland Realm, a title he inherited from his father.","It was unknown if Thranduil had a change of heart, and stayed to aid the Dwarves. However, after the battle ended, he went to Ravenhill alone to find Legolas and Tauriel. He ran into Legolas, who confessed that he could not go back with him. Thranduil advised him to find the Dunedain, for there was a young ranger there whom he should meet - his father, Arathorn, was a good man, and he might become a great man himself. He went on to explain to Legolas that the ranger's name in the wild was \"Strider\", but his true name (Aragorn) was something he had to learn for himself, and he also confided in Legolas that his mother loved him more than anything else in this world. At this, father and son exchanged a mutual gesture of farewell and affection, and Thranduil accepted Legolas' decision to be on his own.","In the Rankin\/Bass 1977 animated version of The Hobbit, Thranduil was voiced by Otto Preminger. In this version he is a golden-haired, balding, green-skinned being whose people bare little resemblance to the more human-looking Elves led by Elrond. He captures Thorin's company after mistaking their approach for an attack, and despite their attempts to convince him otherwise he has them imprisoned. He and Bard later join forces to take the Lonely Mountain, only to quickly join forces with Thorin's army of Dwarves upon seeing the approach of the Goblin Army.","In the 1968 BBC radio series, he is voiced by Leonard Fenton."],"name":"Thranduil","description":"Thranduil was the only son of Oropher, the King of the Woodland Realm. He was born sometime during the late First Age in Doriath before its fall. At the beginning of the Second Age, the Sindar travelled east and Oropher eventually founded Greenwood the Great.\n\nIn SA 3434, Thranduil and his father fought in the Battle of Dagorlad. Oropher was slain and Thranduil returned to Greenwood with roughly a third of the army that had marched to war. He claimed his inheritance and some time before TA 1000 inherited Oropher's title of King of the Woodland Realm, reigning over the south of Greenwood the Great. \n\nAt the beginning of Thranduil's reign his kingdom encompassed all of Greenwood the Great and was known as the Woodland Realm, but as the Third Age progressed, the shadow of the Necromancer advanced, and the Greenwood grew dark and became known as Mirkwood, and became infested with Orcs and giant spiders. The Wood-elves of Mirkwood were reduced in number and retreated to lands in the north of Mirkwood. By the time of the events of The Lord of the Rings Thranduil's title was King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood.\n\nIn his realm, both Sindarin and Silvan Elvish were spoken, though not all members of his Woodland folk spoke Sindarin.\n\nWhen Thorin Oakenshield and his party of Dwarves entered northern Mirkwood, Thranduil captured Thorin and locked him up in a secure room when he refused to divulge his true intentions. The Dwarves were treated well, with plenty of food and drink. Subsequently, when the rest of the Dwarves had been captured by the elves, Thranduil had them unbound and treated them as his guests (save that they were not allowed to leave the caverns), until they angered him by being surly and impolite, insulting him for keeping them as prisoners, and not revealing why they had entered the forest, after which he gave them each their own cell. He did not tell them that Thorin was also his prisoner.\n\nAfter the death of the Dragon Smaug, Thranduil supported Bard the Bowman's claim of a share of the treasure the dwarves recovered from the Lonely Mountain, since Bard was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale, and the treasure of that town had been taken by Smaug to the Lonely Mountain.\n\nThranduil led the elven forces in the Battle of the Five Armies. His army was position on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the first to charge.\n\nAfter the battle and of Thorin's death, Thranduil took Orcrist, which was previously confiscated in Mirkwood, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb. The treasure was divided among Elves and Men, and Thranduil received the emeralds of Girion. Bilbo, Gandalf and Beorn traveled with the elf-host back to Mirkwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thranduil asked them to.\n\nWhen Bilbo and Gandalf bade farewell, Bilbo gave Thranduil a necklace of silver and pearls. The king gave Bilbo the title of \"elf-friend\" and returned with his host in their halls.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, he sent his son Legolas to Rivendell, along with other Elves, to report Gollum's escape from Mirkwood. The gradually-established friendship between the dwarf Gimli and Legolas later helped to reconcile Thranduil's people with the Dwarves.\n\nWhen the forces from Dol Guldur later attacked Mirkwood, Thranduil repulsed an attack and had the victory. His actions were in concert with the Dwarves and the Men of Dale against the Easterlings who attacked from the East. He came into an agreement with Celeborn that the southern part of Mirkwood would be counted as East Lórien. Thranduil took the northern region as far as the mountains; the wide forest between Mirkwood and East Lórien was given to the Beornings. By this time also, Thranduil renamed Mirkwood Eryn Lasgalen, the Wood of Greenleaves.\n\nAfter the fall of Sauron, Thranduil fixed the southern boundary of his realm as the Mountains of Mirkwood, and his realm flourished well into the Fourth Age. He may have stayed on as the king of the Great Forest or left Middle-earth and departed to the Undying Lands.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Thranduil"}}

Her father also taught her about plants and animals, and when her father was killed by Orcs while on a mission with Arathorn she requested to take his place and become a ranger, having often felt more at home in the forest than in village life. Arador was resistant to the idea, because although young women were taught basic woodlore and weapon training, they were usually not fighters. Feeling guilty about her father\u2019s death, Arathorn supported her decision and requested that his father allow him to include her in his team. When Arador reluctantly agreed, he taught her the skills she'd need.\n\nElgarain was in love with Arathorn, but was devastated when he married Gilraen. Dirhaborn had been hiding his love for her, but finally revealed it when she planned to go far away to flee from her love for Arathorn.

He came to regret the creation of this \"rabble of eddaic-named dwarves, [...] invented in an idle hour\" (The Return of the Shadow:452), since it forced him to come up with an explanation of why Old Norse names should be used in Third Age of Middle-earth. He solved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that Old Norse was a translation of the language of Dale. The figure of Gandalf has other influences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation as \"the Wanderer\", an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff. Tolkien states that he thinks of Gandalf as an \"Odinic wanderer\" in a letter of 1946. Gandalf is also similar to Väinämöinen, a Bard in Finnish mythology.","The original painting was auctioned at Sotheby's in London on July 12, 2005 for 84,000.

He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of the hat.","However, even this form seems to have restrictions, as the Ainur were said to have their power restricted upon descending to earth.

Sometimes during combat, Gandalf would be seen wielding both weapons against his enemies.","Gandalf utilised his staff for various spells and abilities. He didn't use it just as a weapon; he also utilised a staff as if it were a walking stick. He initially had an old wooden staff which he lost in the Mines of Moria while fighting the Balrog. He used a new one upon becoming Gandalf the White. In the extended film adaptation, the Witch-king of Angmar seemed to know the 'activation word' for the staff - shattering it and leaving Gandalf exposed for a moment - during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, in Minas Tirith.","This was an Elven sword Gandalf found in a troll cave. From that point until the resolution of the War of the Ring, he used this as a weapon to complement his staff, wielding them with equal skill. In many cases, he fought with both weapons at once.","Sean Connery was originally considered for the role of Gandalf, but turned it down because he didn't want to spend so long in New Zealand, where the film was shot; Tom Baker of Doctor Who fame, Patrick Stewart, Christopher Plummer, and David Bowie were also considered or approached. McKellen's interpretation of the role was widely praised. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, making him the only individual cast member to be nominated for his performance. Christopher Lee, a lifelong fan of the books, had hoped to be cast as Gandalf, but due to his advancing age, he instead opted for the role of Saruman, as Gandalf required more horse riding and more sword work.","John Huston provided the voice of Gandalf in two animated television features by Rankin\/Bass (The Hobbit and The Return of the King).","In the 1978 animated film of The Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, Gandalf was voiced by William Squire.

He was a Maia of Manwë and Varda. He also served under two other Valar, such as Irmo and Nienna. When the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as Wizards) to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those in Middle-earth who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda decided to include Olórin among the five who were sent.\n\nAt first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and too afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told him that that was one main reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Thus, he insisted that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him not to include Olórin as the third, but as the second. Olórin agreed, and prepared for his departure from the Undying Lands with the other four wizards.\n\nWhen he arrived to Middle-earth, he received Narya, the ring of fire, from Círdan the Shipwright. Olórin, renamed Gandalf, spent many centuries walking among the Elves as a stranger, learning from them and teaching them. He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and eventually became known as the wisest of and most powerful of that order. He joined the White Council, which was formed to investigate a dark power in Dol Guldur, of which Galadriel wanted him to become the leader, yet Saruman came to lead the Council instead of him. Although Saruman was at first more powerful, was more knowledgeable about many matters regarding Sauron and the Rings of Power, and was head of the White Council before the War of the Ring, he later grew jealous and afraid of Gandalf, which was the reason of his betrayal.\n\nGandalf wandered for many years amongst the Free People of Middle-earth, but spent most of that time amongst the Elves, where he learned much and taught much. He also continued to gather such information about Sauron and his ilk as he could, and to that end, he began to suspect that the Necromancer of Dol Guldur was in fact Sauron taking shape once again. He entered Dol Guldur, but Sauron, still greatly weakened, fled from him and for a short time, the evil of Mirkwood was greatly reduced. However, Sauron quickly returned to Dol Guldur, and by 2850 of the Third Age, had rebuilt his forces there. In that year, Gandalf again entered the fortress and encountered Thráin II, father of Thorin Oakenshield, who was dying after having been horribly tormented. Before his death, the old Dwarf king entrusted Gandalf with a map and key to the Lonely Mountain.\n\nIn the year 2941, Gandalf became troubled by his knowledge of Sauron's resurgent strength. He knew that Sauron was already plotting war from Dol Guldur, and that as soon as he felt strong enough, he would attack Rivendell. Unfortunately, the only power left besides Rivendell to resist an attempt from Mirkwood to regain the lands of Angmar was the Dwarves of the Iron Hills. Even worse, Gandalf knew that Smaug to Golden resided still in the Lonely Mountain, and that Sauron could and would use the dragon to devastating effect once he became strong enough to influence Smaug. However, Saruman seemed reluctant to engage Sauron's forces, though none of the White Council realized that he was already a traitor.\n\nOne night, while pondering the problem of the Free People's weakness in the North, Gandalf had a chance encounter in Bree with the Dwarf Thorin II Oakenshield, who was also searching, without direction or much hope, for a way to reclaim the Kingdom Under the Mountain. Gandalf and Thorin then concocted a plan (more Gandalf's than Thorin's) to potentially draw the dragon out of the mountain and reclaim the kingdom. To that end, Gandalf visited Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of the Shire, to convince him to go with Thorin and Company to Erebor and aid them. At the time, Bilbo thought of him as little more than a vain, a fussy old conjurer who entertained children with fireworks during festivals and parties, but soon discovered his true nature. It is on this quest that Gandalf finds his sword, Glamdring, and that Bilbo finds his sword, Sting, and the One Ring (though at the time it is mistaken for a lesser ring).\n\nGandalf himself joined the quest both in order to see what he could do to destroy the dragon, and to try to convince the White Council (particularly Saruman) to oust Sauron from Dol Guldur. During the Dwarves' quest, Gandalf vanished twice\u2014 once to scout their path, the second time to \"attend to other pressing business\", the nature of which he refused to discuss. He was actually attending a meeting of the White Council. When Bilbo found the One Ring, Gandalf was immediately suspicious of the Hobbit's story of how he acquired it. He privately confronted Bilbo and forced the truth out of him, and is deeply troubled by his story of the Ring's powers as they seem eerily familiar. Perhaps even more troubling to him is that Bilbo, a proper, honorable hobbit, would uncharacteristically lie about his story.\n\nGandalf abandoned Thorin's company when they reached Mirkwood to participate in the White Council's assault on Dol Guldur. The attack appeared to drive out The Necromancer (Sauron), though he immediately retreated to his long-prepared stronghold of Barad-dûr. Gandalf rejoined Thorin's company at the very moment the Battle of Five Armies breaks out, bearing news of the arrival of a goblin and warg army. Gandalf fought in the battle, and helped destroy the goblin threat. Thorin himself was slain during the battle, but Gandalf's primary aim was achieved; with the destruction of Smaug and the ousting of the goblin army, Dáin II Ironfoot became King under the Mountain and restored the Lonely Mountain to a powerful kingdom. This, along with the strengthening of the Kingdom of Dale, allowed the Free People of the Northern region of Middle-earth to have considerable preparation against Sauron's forces during the later War of the Ring, where before they had virtually none. Following the battle, Gandalf accompanied Bilbo back to the Shire.\n\nGandalf spent the years between TA 2941 to TA 3001 travelling Middle-earth in search of information on Sauron's resurgence and Bilbo's mysterious ring. He spent as much time as he could in the Shire, however, strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and befriending Bilbo's nephew, Frodo, while simultaneously becoming suspicious of Saruman and his allegiances.\n\nIn TA 3001, around the time of Bilbo's \"Eleventy-First\" (111th) birthday party, Gandalf returned to the Shire, bringing along many fireworks for the occasion. After seeing Frodo and visiting Bilbo again, Gandalf attended the party.\n\nDuring Bilbo's speech, he put on a mysterious ring and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbours. Later as he was bidding farewell to Gandalf, who had known about his plans to leave, Bilbo began to change his mind about leaving his ring to Frodo, as he had earlier agreed. When Gandalf tried to persuade him to leave it, Bilbo became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as his \"precious.\" Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and appeared menacing, frightening the hobbit. This brought Bilbo back to his senses; he apologised, admitted that the Ring had been troubling him lately, and left the ring behind. Bilbo and Gandalf bid each other goodbye, before Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.\n\nTroubled by this, Gandalf mulled over this. Before finally leaving the Shire, Gandalf gave the ring to Frodo, advising him to keep it safe. Over the next seventeen years, Gandalf traveled extensively, searching for answers. Having long sought for Gollum near Mordor, he met Aragorn, who had captured the creature in Mirkwood.\n\nGandalf interrogated Gollum and learned that Sauron had forced Gollum to tell what he knew about the ring under torture. Gandalf left Mirkwood soon after, and left Gollum with the Wood-elves of Northern Mirkwood.\n\nUpon returning to the Shire, Gandalf immediately went to Frodo and confirmed his suspicions by throwing the Ring into Frodo's hearth fire, which revealed, in Black Speech, the inscription upon the ring. Gandalf then told a dumbfounded Frodo about the One Ring and its history, and how Sauron would seek to regain it. Instructing Frodo to go to Rivendell with the ring, Gandalf told him to make arrangements to leave the Shire quietly.\n\nRiding near the Shire, Gandalf encountered Radagast the Brown, another Wizard, referred to as \"his cousin\", who asked him to seek out Saruman the White, as the Nazgûl had come forth and crossed the River Anduin. Before he left, Gandalf instructed Radagast to alert all the 'birds and beasts' that were friendly to the latter to convey messages about the Nazgûl to Saruman and Gandalf at Orthanc.\n\nLeaving a note for Frodo with Barliman Butterbur, an inn-keeper in Bree, Gandalf left for Isengard to speak with Saruman. Once there, however, Gandalf discovered that Saruman wanted the One Ring to himself and declared himself Saruman of Many Colours. He tried to convince Gandalf to either join with him in service to Sauron, so that they could eventually control the Dark Lord and thus achieve good ends, though through evil means, or to help him find the One Ring so they could take power from Sauron. Gandalf refused, and was held prisoner at the top of the tower Orthanc.\n\nAfter spending a while as Saruman's prisoner, Gandalf was eventually rescued by Gwaihir the Eagle. Gwaihir's real purpose for visiting Orthanc was to report a sighting of the Nazgûl, as Radagast had appealed to him to do so earlier on. The great Eagle set Gandalf down in Rohan, where he appealed to King Théoden for a horse.\n\nKing Théoden allowed Gandalf to take any horse he desired, but only to do so quickly. There, Gandalf chose the horse Shadowfax. Riding for the Shire, Gandalf arrived too late for Frodo; he had already set out.\n\nKnowing that Frodo would be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf began to make his own way there. Shortly after arriving in Bree, Gandalf learned that the Hobbits had already began travelling to Rivendell with his ally and old friend: Aragorn. Subsequently, Gandalf was confronted one night by Sauron's Nazgûl at Weathertop. After an all-night battle with the Ringwraiths, Gandalf was able to eventually escape, though four of the nine Nazgûl pursued him.\n\nSeveral days later, Frodo, Aragorn, and company stayed at Weathertop and were confronted by the remaining five Nazgûl. Despite their escape, Frodo was stabbed in the process by the Ringwraith leader, who used a Morgul-blade. Gandalf was able to evade the four Nazgûl and successfully reach Rivendell. However, several days later, an injured Frodo arrived at the Ford of Bruinen, though the Nazgûl pursued him all the way there. Gandalf, along with Elrond, saved Frodo from the Nazgûl by enchanting the water and sweeping them away.\n\nAt Rivendell, Gandalf, along with Frodo, Bilbo, and many others, attended the secret Council of Elrond. There Gandalf explained to the others how Saruman had imprisoned him and how the White Wizard was creating his own army of orcs to rival Sauron's.\n\nAs everyone at the Council debated over the ring, Frodo offered to be the ring-bearer and take it to Mount Doom to be destroyed. Gandalf volunteered to help and protect Frodo on his quest, along with Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli. Sam snuck in and was allowed to go because of this.\n\nWith this the Fellowship of the Ring was formed. Gandalf later convinced Elrond to allow Frodo's cousins, Merry and Pippin, to join the Fellowship. Subsequently, after preparing for the journey, the Fellowship left Rivendell. Gandalf took leadership of the Fellowship, leading the group south after leaving Rivendell. He and Aragorn led the hobbits and their companions on an unsuccessful effort to cross Mount Caradhras.\n\nThey then took the \"dark and secret way\" through the Mines of Moria, much to Aragorn's discomfort; though he had passed through the Mines once before, he had no desire to go through them again, and he feared for Gandalf if they did so. As they tried to leave the mines, at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, Gandalf faced a Balrog, known commonly as Durin's Bane. It was one of the Maiar corrupted by Melkor in the early days of Arda.\n\nGandalf stopped on the Bridge, standing in the middle of the span, allowing the others to escape. He leaned on the staff in his left hand and held the sword Glamdring, gleaming cold and white, in his right. The Balrog stepped onto the Bridge, facing Gandalf, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised its whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm and declared that the Balrog could not pass. They clashed, and the Balrog's sword was shattered. Then the Balrog leaped full upon the Bridge, and Gandalf lifted his staff and smote the span. His staff broke, but the Bridge cracked at the Balrog's feet. The stone beneath the Balrog broke and fell, taking the Balrog with it into the abyss, but the thongs of its whip snared Gandalf about his knees, and Wizard and Balrog plummeted together into the darkness below. Galdalf cried, \"Fly, you fools!\" and was gone.\n\nGandalf and the Balrog fell for a long time, and Gandalf was burned by the Balrog's fire. Then they plunged into a deep lake in the depths of the mountain, which Gandalf later said was cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. They fought in the water until finally the Balrog fled into dark tunnels, where the world is gnawed by nameless things, older even than Sauron. Gandalf pursued the creature until it led him to the spiraling Endless Stair, and they climbed it until they reached Durin's Tower in the living rock of Zirakzigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine above the clouds. There they fought, until at last Gandalf threw down his enemy, and the Balrog broke the mountain-side as it fell. Then darkness took Gandalf, and he passed away. His body lay on the peak. The entire battle, from the confrontation on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm to the mutual demise of the Balrog and Gandalf, had taken ten days.\n\nTwenty days later Gandalf returned to life, and lay in a trance.\n\nThree days later he was found by the windlord Gwaihir, the Lord of the Eagles, who had been sent by Galadriel to find him. Gandalf was carried to Caras Galadhon in Lothlórien, where he was healed, and clothed in white, and thus became Gandalf the White.\n\nIn Fangorn forest he encountered Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas while they were tracking Pippin and Merry, who had been captured by orcs in Gandalf's absence.\n\nRevealing himself to the three, he explained how he had survived and returned. There, Gandalf tried to persuade Aragorn to go to Rohan instead, insisting there are other pressing matters, such as the War coming to Rohan and the impending attack on Edoras by Saruman.\n\nArriving in Rohan with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas, Gandalf discovered King Théoden, weakened by Saruman's agent, Grima Wormtongue. However, Gandalf quickly broke Wormtongue and Saruman's hold over Théoden.\n\nWhile Théoden and the Rohirrim rode to Helm's Deep to do battle with the hordes of Isengard, Gandalf rode to Orthanc and asked Treebeard to encourage the Huorns to Assist him in defeating Saruman and his Uruk-hai. He also rode to find Erkenbrand and his men and persuaded them to ride to Helm's Deep.\n\nAfter overthrowing Saruman, Gandalf broke his rival's staff and banished him from the Order of Wizards. Then, against his counsel, Pippin glanced into the Palantír of Orthanc that he recovered from Saruman and made contact with Sauron. He then took Pippin with him to Gondor to aid in the defense of the city. Along the way, Gandalf gave Pippin a brief history of Palantír, mentioning Feanor, and how it was fortunate that Pippin made contact with Sauron instead of himself, since he was not yet ready for a meeting with Sauron. Arriving at Minas Tirith, he met with Denethor II and tried to give him counsel.\n\nAfter Faramir's charge, the Morgul host assaulted the city. Gandalf provided valuable aid to the White City and bought precious time allowing the Rohirrim to save Gondor during The Battle of the Pelennor Fields. When the battering ram Grond breached the gates of the city, numerous trolls rushed through, attacking the defenders. However, Gandalf rode in and helped kill a few. Gandalf alone stood in defiance of the Witch-King, however Gandalf's power was never tested. With the timely arrival of Rohan, the Witch-king left to deal with the new threat. With the arrival of Rohan, and the pleas of Pippin concerning Denethor's intention to kill Faramir and himself, Gandalf rushed to Faramir's aid. Gandalf took Faramir from the pyre and tried to deter Denethor from suicide. However, driven mad by his grief and Sauron's messages via the Palantír of Minas Tirith, Denethor set the pyre aflame while looking into said Palantír. In grief, Gandalf closed the doors of the chamber. Denethor later gave out a cry and said no more. Soon afterward, Gandalf delegated the control of the city to the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n\nGandalf, alongside Aragorn, led the final battle against Sauron's forces at the Black Gate, waging an all-out battle to distract the Dark Lord's attention away from Frodo and Sam, who were at the very same moment scaling Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. Though the forces of good were heavily outnumbered, they were able to hold back the enemy until the hobbits reached the peak of Mount Doom.\n\nOn the precipice within, looking over the fires of Mount Doom, Frodo finally succumbed the power of the Ring, slipping it onto his finger. However, Gollum, unable to bear the thought that the Ring would be destroyed, lunged at Frodo, biting off his ring finger, and the Ring, in the process. Gollum and the Ring fell into the fire, and the Ring was finally destroyed. Without Gandalf's efforts, Sauron might have learned where the two hobbits were and killed them before they could have completed their task.\n\nFour years after the ring was destroyed, Gandalf spent some time with the \"moss gatherer\" Tom Bombadil, then, after having spent over 2,000 years in Middle-earth, departed with Frodo, Galadriel, Celeborn, Bilbo, Elrond, (and presumably Shadowfax) across the sea to the Undying Lands, and was never seen again in Middle-earth.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gandalf"}}

Who was an ancient ancestor."],"name":"Ælfwine","description":"Eriol or Ælfwine is an English mariner of the \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 period who, sailing far westwards over the ocean, came at last to Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle, where dwelt Elves who had departed from \u2018the Great Lands\u2019, afterwards \u2018Middle-Earth\u2019. During his sojourn in Tol Eressëa he learned from them the true and ancient history of the Creation, of the Gods, of the Elves, and of England.\n\nThe Tale of Tinúviel (which is the beginning of the Beren and Lúthien saga) is one of the stories that was told to Eriol by the Elves in the Lonely Isle, in this case by a maiden named Vëannë: there were many children present at these story-tellings. He questions Veanne at different points through the story, and the end and she clarifies a few details.\n\nFrom the stories Eriol heard, and other versions he translates them and adapts them into a compendium entitled the Quenta Noldorinwa (a version of The Silmarillion). He subtitled is the \u2018the brief history of the Noldoli or Gnomes\u2019, drawn from the Book of Lost Tales which Eriol [Ælfwine] wrote.\n\nÆlfwine was a Man (or men) who lived between (c. 500, 900, 1001 A.D.) near Europe. The main development history is discussed in two parts in the The Book of Lost Tales in the The Cottage of Lost Play (chapter) and The History of Eriol or Ælfwine and the End of the Tales.\n\nAnother version of the history saw development as part of The Lost Road, and discussed in the The Notion Club Papers, and other sources. Which develop a basic concept how he reached Tol Eressea or at least saw it in vision. While other sources build on this and have him reach the Lonely Isle, where he is then associated with Pengolod history (and other authors works in the Sage's collection).\n\nThe earliest account is associated the The Book of Lost Tales, and is discussed in the chapter The Cottage of Lost Play (chapter) (part of the HoMe series), which acts as a prologue to the Lost Tales as such. More details of this early period and additional notes are included in The Book of Lost Tales vol 2 as well.\n\nIn this version Ælfwine is Danish man who was originaly named Ottor Wæfre who lived in the lands East of the North Sea around c. 500 A.D. He lived much of his life on the waters. He lived in the period preceding the Anglo-Saxon invasions of Britain.\n\nHis father's was named Eoh who was slain by his brother Beorn. Both were the sons of Heden, and like many heroes of Northern legend traced his ancestry to the god Wóden.\n\nOttor would come to settle on the island of Heligoland in the North sea, and he wedded a woman named Cwén; they had two sons 'named after his father' Hengest and Horsa 'to avenge Eoh', and around 500 A.D. they took part in the invasion of Britain.\n\nHe was said to be a son of Eärendel, born under his beam (beam meams 'star-sign' or shining from the star Earendel). It states that if the beam from Eärendel falls on a child, the new-born becomes 'a child of Eärendel' and a wanderer.\n\nAfter the death of his wife, Cwen, Ottor left his young children, as the sea calls to him. Hengest and Horsa went to avenge Eoh and became great Chieftains; but Ottor set out to sea, and find, Tol Eressëa (uncú þa holm, \u2018the unknown island\u2019)\n\nHe met elves and other fairy folk and from them learned stories of ancient times. he was given the names Ælfwine (Elf-friend') and Eriol ('One Who Dreams Alone'), and he adopted the name Angol, and that he was named by the Gnomes (Noldor) 'after the regions of his home' (the region Angol is also known as Eriollo to the Noldor, and relates to the Danish peninsula between Flensburg fjord and the river Schei, south of the modern Danish Frontier, no great distance to the island of Heligoland).\n\nÆlfwine hears stories, marries Naimi (Éadgifu), niece of Vairë. They have a son named Heorrenda. Eriol tells stories of interest to the elves including the fairies of Wóden, Þunor, Tíw, etc. The elves identify them as and they identified them with Manweg, Tulkas, and other great Valar. His son grows up and becomes associated with Hengest and Horsa (his sons under Cwen), who invade England. Ælfwine sons become known as the Engle who are keepers of the true mythological history of Britain.\n\nThis took place roughly in the time after the Fall of Gondolin and the march of the Elves of Kôr into the Great Lands for the defeat of Melko, when the Elves who had taken part in it had returned over the sea to dwell in Tol Eressëa; but before the time of the \u2018Faring Forth\u2019 and the removal of Tol Eressëa to the geographical position of England (an idea that would be lost in later writings).\n\nIn the next few versions as discussed in Book of Lost Tales, vol 2, he becomes an Englishman of the Anglo-Saxon period' who dwelt in the South-west (of England) in Wessex in the 11th century.\n\nHe is said to be the kin of Ing, King of Luthany. The Ingwaiwar ('sons of Ing') (Inguaeones) were the Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain (and connected to Ingwë) and his ancestors, who descended from Ermon and Elmir, the first Men.\n\nDuring his childhood he is said to be a great lover of the elves, especially of the shoreland Elves that still lived in Luthany. He always sought for Tol Eressea where the fairies were said to have retired. He has learned ancient tongue of English and Elfin speeches. His mother and father were slain by sea-pirates and he was made captive. He escapes, and driven westward by Normans, he meets the Ancient Mariner (Ulmo), who teaches him where to find Tol Eressea or seo unwemmede íeg), \"whither most of the unfaded Elves have retired from noise, war, and clamour of Men\".\n\nSailing from England out into the Atlantic Ocean, he passes the Magic Islands, and surives a shipwreck, he wakes upon the Lonely Island. It is said that he loved the sign of Orion, and made the sign, hence the fairies called him Lúthien (Wanderer), or (man of Luthany). Luthany is the name the elves given his homeland, meaning 'friend' and 'friendship' Eldaros or Ælfhâm).\n\nLuthien Aelfwine drinks of the Limpë (much like Ing before him), but thirsted for his home, and went back to Luthany, and then thirsted unquenchably for the Elves, and went back to Tavrobel the Old and dwelt at the House of the Hundred Chimneys (where grows still the child of the child of the Pine of Balawryn) where he wrote the Golden Book: The Book of Lost Tales and the History of the Elves of Luthany: The Golden Book of Tavrobel. The Parma Kuluinen \u2018the Golden Book\u2014the collected book of legends, especially of Ing and Eärendel\u2019.\n\nAt one point as discussed in The Book of Lost Tales, vol. 2, Tolkien appears to have been restarting the Lost Tales from scratch, and he wrote notes and a couple of short drafts for a new prologue for the new Lost Tales, called Ælfwine of England. There are about two versions of this generation.\n\nIn this Ælfwine is an Englishmen (or an early pagan Englishmen who fled to the west).\n\nThis version of the story appears to put events closer closer to Middle-earth geography in which England is a land named Lúthien by the elves of the Northern lands upon the Great Sea, off the coast of Forodwaith (this is said to be a specific reference to the Vikings). Eldairon (Ælfwine) is the son of a prince Déor Elf-friend (Deor the Minstrel of Kortirion) and maiden Éadgifu.\n\nIn this version of the story England is what remains of and island that got shattered during the warfare of the Gods. The Isle of Ivren (Ireland) was the isle west of Tol Eressea said to have been broken off during this warfare.\n\nÆlfwine makes his way to Tol Eressea (possibly with others). He hears stories, marries Naimi. They have thad a son named Heorrenda. His son grows up and becomes associated with Hengest and Horsa who invade England. Heorrenda of Tavrobel goes on to become a poet and writer of Beowulf due to his association with his brother Hengest (Tolkien actually linked Beowulf to Heorrenda during his lectures on the subject at Oxford). Ælfwine sons become known as the Engle who are keepers of the true mythological history of Britain.\n\nThis brings it somewhat full circle back to his original Idea in The Cottage of Lost Play (chapter).\n\nThe Lost Road and The Notion Club Papers' suggests yet another background Ælfwine is the son of Eadwane or Eadwane is the son of Ælfwine (with a sort of time travel element and reincarnation involved, with the possibility of multle \"Elf-friends\" through time). This ties more or less into the Pengolod 900 A.D history.\n\nThe story concerns the idea of 'Preincarnation': there are a series of occurrences throughout time of father and son duos sharing names that are etymologically connected with Amandil ('Bliss-friend') and Elendil ('Elf-friend'). These include Eädwine-Ælfwine of Anglo-Saxon legend, Audoin-Alboin of Lombardic, through to \"the traditions of the North Sea concerning the coming of corn and culture heroes, ancestors of kingly lines, in boats\". In the story the present pair\u2014Edwin and Elwin\u2014travel back through the different phases of the history of their names, eventually reaching the time of Amandil and Elendil and the Akallabêth or Atalantie ('Downfall' in Númenórean and Quenya respectively) of Númenor.\n\nThere is some shared overlap between Lost Road and The Notion Club Papers, some of this history is discussed below (though certain characters are switched Eadwine as father, or son of AElfwine for example.).\n\nAElfwine was born in 869 A.D. as the grandson of Oswine, and son of Eadwine (aka Eadwine Oswine's son). He was born just before the death of Saint Edmund. When he was a child his father Eadwine had taken his ship, Earendel, out beyond the deep sea, and  never returned. AElfwine was 45 during the Danish raids in the region of Severn which took place in 914. AElfwine named his own son Eadwine, and his wife was from Cornwall.\n\nÆlfwine and Eadwine live in the time of Edward the Elder, in North Somerset. AElfwine ruined by the incursions of Danes. The events beings with the attack (c. 915) on Portloca (Porlock) and Waeced. AElfwine, a seaman of England, waits for Eadwine's return at night. There is a conversation between Ælfwine and Eadwine Eadwine is sick of of the battle. He says the Danes have more sense; always pressing on. They go west, and pass round and go to Ireland; while the English sit like Wealas (Welsh\/foreigner) waiting to be made into slaves. Eadwine discusses strange tales he heard strange tales from Ireland. There is a story of a land in the North-west filled with ice, but fit for men to dwell. It is there, that holy hermits have been driven out by Norsemen. AElfwine has Christian objections to traveling there. Eadwine replies that the holy Brendan did so centuries ago, and many others, as Maelduin. They came back stating it was a paradise, and that they didn't want to leave it behind. Aelfwine doesn't believe Paradise can be reached by ship due to the dangerous and deeper waters between us than Garsecg (Great Sea). He mentions that the roads are bent: and that a person will circle back in the end. Thus there is no escape by ship.\n\nEadwine didn't believe Ælfwine, and hopes he isn't telling the truth. He believed their ancestors had won new lands by ship, and he refrences the story of Sceaf. In the end they leave with ten neighbours. They are pursued by Vikings off Lundy. The Wind takes them out to sea, and persists. Eadwine falls sick and begins to say odd things. AElfwine dreams too, of mountainous and seas. The Straight Road..... and water off the coast of the island of Azores? Eadwine becomes worse, such that AElfwine has to restrain him. They believe it a vision of delirium. It turns out to be the vision of Eressea and the sound of voices. They apparently are lifted into the air. AElfwine resigns himself believing they are going to die, but prays for Eadwine.\n\nHe feels a sensation of falling, and they come down landing back in the sea, and the west wind blows them back. They end up Landing in Ireland (they settle there, and this leads to Finntan (a town named after a Nephew of Noah, or meeting the oldest man in the world?).\n\nAnother scrap of notes and poetry adds these details...\n\nHe sails out to sea (this is a reference to his leaving with Eadwine), but is driven to sea off the coast of Erin, passed into the deep waters of the west, and by some strange grace finds the 'straight road' of the Elvenfolk, and at last to the Isle of Eressea in Elvenhome. Others however, believe he only received a dream while hungry and dehydrated, and in a trance was granted a vision of the isle, as it has once been, and a West wind drove him back to Middle-earth. There are no other stories of anyone reported seeing Eressea. (This references the 'vsion' or dream he had in The Lost Road account, and its not clear if he actually ever reached Tol Eressea or only had visions of it before he was returned back to the East) The idea  that AElfwine never in fact reached the Lonely Isle is found in a version of  the old tale of AElwine of  England, where  he did  not leap  overboard but  returned east with his companions,\n\nThis would seem to indicate that this dream or 'vision' was so vivid that he really believed he had visited Eressea, and could remember the stories he read to record them and transcribe them into English.\n\nHowever, following his return AElfwine was never again able to rest for long on land, and sailed the western seas until his death. Some say that his ship was wrecked upon the west shores of Erin and there his body lies; others say that at the end of his life he went forth alone into the deeps again and never returned. It is at this point he likely finally 'returned' to or made it to Eresssea for the first time, and never returned from there again.\n\nStill another version of the story as told in the Notion Club Papers begins with AElfwine and another companion Treowine.\n\nThe story discusses their journey on the seas with other cailorsompanions. and coming to the 'straight road' tossed over the island briefly AElfwine sees the Book of Stories, begins writing down what he can remember. This leaves him with fleeting memories of certain stories the Fall of Numenor and others with Elendil and Voronwë escaping. They discover that AElfwine is the descendent of Elendil and Treowine is descendent of Veronwe of Numenore. Furthermore their future descendants in the 20th century (Alwin Arundel Lowdham and Wilfrid Trewin Jeremy) would have 'dreams' themselves calling back to these events.\n\nThis leads to history that explains another account of what really happened as discussed in War of the Jewels, and Letters of Tolkien (c. 1948):\n\nÆlfwine of England in (c.900 A.D.),  called by  the Elves  Eriol, was blown off-course  west  from  Ireland, eventually  came upon  the 'Straight Road' and found Tol Eressea the Lonely Isle.  He  brought  back copies  and translations  of many  works. Much of the works originated from Pengolod; an Elvish sage in Tol Eressëa (or just Eressëa) from whom the mariner Aelfwine heard the legends that make up The Silmarillion.\n\nThe Pengolod materials appear to be the version he was settling on at least in many of his later sources, and notes, and letters. References of it appear as late 1950s\/1960s. Though Tolkien fluctuations between Ælfwine translating Pengolod's works (implying he has been long gone), or hearing stories from him directly, and sometimes both. In Teachings of Pengolod (1960) discusses one of the texts as an \"...example  and  record  of the instruction of AElfwine the Mariner by Pengolod the Wise of Gondolin,\"\n\nAccording to The Peoples of Middle-earth, perhaps one of the final of these writings (if not the final writing in AElfwine is addressed) was likely the Akallabêth which was written in the mid to late-1960s.\n\nChristopher Tolkien notes that in the original version (which he published in the Silmarillion), that the work is written in the voice of Pengolod, and that the story was originally addressed to AElfwine by him.\n\nHe admits that this removal made the whole source lose its anchorage in Eldarin lore, and led him to make excessive vigilance incorrect changes to altar the end of the paragraph (perhaps editorial work that was not his to properly make, as he went against his father's original intent). Christopher also points out the last paragraph of Akallabeth as published in the Silmarillion, still contains indirect references to AElfwane and other 'future mariners, which he never chose to alter or remove.\n\nDepending on the versions of the story Eriol either travels west from Europe to reach the Lonely Island which he remains at in and in time becomes England. Or he travels from England to reach the island in distant place near Valinor.\n\nThe name Ælfwine simply means \"Elf-friend\", and is the Old English equivalent of Elendil. The name Alvin is a modern descendant. It is possibly intended as a cognate of Alboin.\n\nAlthough there is little evidence of this storyline in the published version of The Silmarillion (in some cases due to Christopher Tolkien or Guy Gavriel Kay's tampering of the original text), some of the later writings of Tolkien indicate that he didn't fully abandon the idea. However, although Ælfwine is still referred to in some post-Lord of the Rings writings, Tolkien ultimately changed the intended framework of The Silmarillion or at least parts of it from the tale of Ælfwine to one based around Bilbo Baggins' Translations from the Elvish books of \"Elvish lore\".\n\nHowever, as noted above, this was not the case of the Akallabêth, which was never intended to be part of the Silmarillion but its own separate work was intended to be in the voice of Pengolod to AElfwine, and the last paragraph still contains a reference to AElfwine's voyages that was not removed.\n\nIn addition, the idea of various stories coming from different 'voices' Hobbits, Elves, Man, and others throughout history is not completely dropped in any of the sources, leaving that kernel that in some distant 'future' Ælfwine also encountered story tellers and materials by other writers and released his own adaptations of the stories (as noted in Beren and Lúthien) allowing for the 'discrepancies' between accounts to arise.\n\nÆlfwine is also given as the author of the various translations in Old English that appear in The History of Middle-earth series. A minor discrepancy is that whereas Ælfwine is described as hailing from the north-west of England, his Old English texts are in the Mercian dialect, which was Tolkien's favourite. He also referenced in the The Teachings of Pengolod. Perhaps his most important work he was intended to be part of was Akallabêth.\n\nÆlfwine was intended to be the introductory voice adapting Middle-earth, and a number of other legends into his greater 'new mythology for England' concept. Hence his sons Hengist and Heorrenda also appears within other stories. This was a matter to which J.R.R. Tolkien gave much time and thought; he lectured on it at Oxford and developed certain original theories, especially in connection with the appearance of Hengest in Beowulf. ...and Heorrenda as Beowulf's unknown poet.\n\nIt's not necessarily that Eriol life extended some 300-500 years, which each of the given dates (500, 900, 1th century) are simply revisions of moving the character and his background several centuries forward or back (as Tolkien was developing the character's history). However, its worth noting that in the Lost Tales Eriol does infact drink a draught (Limpë) which is said to extend his life to that much like the elves. So the idea that could have lived several hundred years is already tied into concepts Tolkien was developing.\n\nLikewise certain elements of \"Ing\" (who comes to be known as Ingwë, sharing his name with the famous Elven king) and Eriol's own backstory seem to share elements of the early Ottor story (who also traveled to Tol Eressea, and lived there drinking of the Limpe), as such making it possible there were multiple AElwines.(\"Elf-friends\") from different eras. Tolkien even touches on a kind of reincarnation or rebirth (in The Lost Road, and in Notion Club Papers) with the character that could link him to several eras. The Notion Club Papers has a section where characters are talking and saying there have been many great Aelfwines in history (which they mention both historical and fictional ones).\n\nAccording to The History of the Hobbit the author surmises that J.R.R. Tolkien had briefly thought of making Bilbo Baggins replace the concept of AElfwine.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/%C3%86lfwine"}}

To many, he is a deadly creature. A shadow, spoken of in whispers and fear, even among the powerful. He is one of Sauron's cruelest underlings, and plays an important, yet still mysterious, role in the plans for bringing Middle-earth to its knees.\n\nHe is first seen at Sarn Ford, an encampment of the Dunedain Rangers. He arrives just after the Nazgûl have finished purging the rangers, and meets with the Witch-King. He tells him he has stirred the Orcs of the mountains, and is gathering his forces at old Fornost. Before leaving, he says that the northern lands have known peace for too long, and that they'll soon feel Sauron's wrath.\n\nIn Fornost, his Orc and goblin warriors are being cut down, and his war machines have been destroyed. In the city's citadel where he dwells, he tells his orc chief Tharzog to deal with the intruders that are causing so much problems. He is chased to the citadel's top by Elladan and Elrohir, the twin sons of Elrond, the Half-elven. He duels the brothers and overpowers them, until their companions Andriel, Eradan, and Farin arrive. Outnumbered, Agandaûr flees on a Fell beast. Despite being pursued by the Great Eagle Beleram, Agandaûr uses his sorcery to blast the Eagle with lightning, and he escapes.\n\nAgandaûr takes no part in the gathering of orcs in the Ettenmoors, but he is mentioned as the one who corrupted the Stone giant Bargrisar.\n\nAgandaûr is also revealed by Radagast the wizard to be recruiting the dragon Urgost of the Grey Mountains. Urgost tells Agandaûr he'll consider his offer on his own time. Before leaving, Agandaûr tells the dragon it would be wise not to defy Sauron, and that he'll leave behind some warriors just in case. Afterward, Agandaûr plots and unleashes an attack on the Dwarven stronghold of Nordinbad.\n\nAfter the siege of Nordinbad, Eradan, Andriel and Farin head for Agandaûr's lair of Carn Dûm, the former capital of Angmar. Agandaûr battles the three heroes, and leads them to the bridge of the citadel. There, Agandaûr uses his mastery of sorcery to destroy the trio, but fails. As he dies, he asks for his master's help, though at the same moment, Frodo Baggins has destroyed the One Ring. Instead, he disintegrates and the only thing left is his helmet. With Agandaûr's death, Sauron's forces in the North were vanquished, and Angmar was all but destroyed.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Aganda%C3%BBr"}}

However Fili carried a spade, (Presumably to forage, and to aid in building firepits, as well as a tool for barriars, and traps.) and while the books made no mention of Kili carrying a bow, it is presumed by readers.","A possible second factor in Tolkien's decision to kill off the two younger Dwarves at the end of The Hobbit concerns the succession to the throne of the Lonely Mountain. Thorin, patriarchal head of Durin's Folk, becomes King Under the Mountain upon the death of the dragon Smaug. Dáin Ironfoot, his cousin and the eldest surviving direct descendant of Durin, succeeds him. However, had Fíli and Kíli not been killed at the Battle of Five Armies, then one of the two brothers would have assumed the kingship, as they would have been the sole surviving heirs of the senior line. If the genealogy cited above in Appendix A of The Lord of the Rings is correct, Fíli would have been King under the Mountain. If Thorin's statement in The Hobbit that Fíli was the youngest is correct, then Kíli, as the older brother, would have become king. It could be that Tolkien had already envisioned the venerable Dáin as becoming king after the battle, and that he felt it would be somewhat awkward for one of the two young brothers to become King and play such a central role; when he noticed the problem of succession as he revised the book's draft, he decided that the noble deaths of the Dwarves defending Thorin was a fitting end.","In the animated version of The Hobbit, their roles are relatively minor compared to the book and have few lines; both brothers are voiced by Don Messick.","Soon the Company is rescued by Bilbo, using barrels from the wine cellars to escape.

Kíli climbs up to operate the mechanism for opening the portcullis and is injured by an arrow to the leg. Tauriel saves him once again, Kíli is able to open the portcullis, and he continues down the river with the rest of the Company. Later Tauriel, having learned from an orc captive that the arrow wounding Kíli was poisoned, follows the Dwarves (accompanied by Legolas) in order to save him.","As shown in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug film, Fíli wields various weapons and hides them in his person.

His name is a compromise between the Sindarin Faenor and the Quenya Fëanáro, meaning \"Spirit of fire\"."],"name":"Fëanor","description":"Fëanor drew so much of Míriel's life energy when he was born that she grew weary of living and her spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving her family for the Halls of Mandos. After a time, Finwë remarried and had four more children; Fëanor's half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin, and half-sisters Findis and Irimë. Though he loved his father as dearly as a son could, Fëanor was not fond of his stepmother Indis nor her children, and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings. In his youth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship and language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of Rúmil and created the system of writing known as Tengwar. He also became a student of Mahtan, a great smith who had learned his craft at the feet of Aulë himself. From Mahtan, he learned much of metallurgy, and at some point he wedded Mahtan's daughter Nerdanel, who bore him seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras. He spent most of his time either alone or with his sons, and they were all completely loyal to him. He also was known to have been restless, exploring as much of Aman as he could and constantly crafting new works.\n\nBy far the greatest of Fëanor's crafting achievements was the creation of the Silmarils, also called the Great Jewels. To make them, Fëanor captured some of the intermingled light from the Two Trees of Valinor and, by unknown means, locked it into three large diamond-like gems. His creations garnered him great praise, and he came to prize the Silmarils above all else. However, as time went on, he began to covet the gems with a greedy love, and he increasingly ignored the fact that the light which lay in the gems and gave them their beauty was not of his own making. Fëanor alternated between vainly displaying the jewels and jealously guarding them from all but his immediate family, though eventually he came to the point where they almost always remained under lock and key.\n\nAfter three ages of imprisonment, Melkor, the mightiest of the Valar and the world's primordial source of evil, deceived the Valar with a false show of repentance. Pardoned and residing in Valinor, his malice had in fact reached hitherto unprecedented level, and its primary target quickly became the Elves, as it had been for their sake that he had been overthrown. He found that, of the three primary groups of Elves in Valinor, the Ñoldor were the easiest to manipulate due to their thirst for knowledge and willingness to listen. Focusing his efforts solely on the Ñoldor, he subtly spread lies amongst them that the Valar were keeping them imprisoned in Valinor so that the race of Men might inherit Middle-earth and claim the glory that could have been theirs. Although Fëanor mistrusted and feared Melkor, in his arrogance and impatience he often unwittingly repeated the lies of Melkor. He quickly became the most prominent of the rebellious Ñoldor, to the point where the other Valar, not knowing of Melkor's lies, saw him as the source of the Ñoldor's distemper.\n\nMelkor coveted the Silmarils and hated Fëanor, but he hid his intentions from the Ñoldor and the Valar as the situation continued to deteriorate. Melkor's lies eventually came to the point where rumors began to circulate amongst some that Fëanor's half-brother Fingolfin was planning not only to usurp his place as heir to Finwë, but also to seize the Silmarils for himself. In his pride and vanity, Fëanor took little convincing, and his hostility grew to the point to where he threatened Fingolfin with violence. The Valar, having put up with Fëanor's rabble-rousing for some time, could not ignore the transgression of breaking the peace of Valinor and so summoned Fëanor to the Ring of Doom to explain himself. Fëanor's testimony revealed the malice of Melkor and his lies, and Tulkas immediately left the Ring to apprehend him again. Despite Melkor having been the true root of the Ñoldor's unrest, Fëanor's crime had been of his own making, and for this the Valar exiled him to Formenos. He took a substantial treasure with him, including the Silmarils, which he put in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finwë also withdrew to Formenos and renounced the kingship so long as Fëanor remained in exile.\n\nSome time later, Melkor unexpectedly appeared at Formenos where he tried to sway Fëanor to his side, proclaiming that the Valar had treated him unjustly. However, Fëanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, and he vehemently dismissed the fallen Vala. Melkor left in a rage and fled from Valinor. He feigned to go north, but ultimately turned south, passing as a cloud to the unexplored southern coast of Aman. The Valar later sought to mend the breach between Fëanor and Fingolfin, and invited them to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offered a hand to his half-brother, recognizing Fëanor's place as the eldest, but it was returned by Fëanor somewhat grudgingly.\n\nMelkor stole away to Avathar in the south of Aman. There he discovered the evil spider-like creature Ungoliant and secured her as an ally, promising that her unrelenting hunger would be satisfied in return for her aid. During the festivities at which Fëanor and Fingolfin had reconciled, Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Two Trees and plunged Valinor into complete darkness. Melkor and Ungoliant then went to Formenos, where Melkor slew Finwë and ransacked the vault, taking the Silmarils and many other treasures. They then escaped by crossing the Helcaraxë, or Grinding Ice, in the north to Beleriand in Middle-earth. Though the Valar attempted pursuit, it was ultimately in vain, for the Unlight of Ungoliant completely obscured the sight of the pursuers.\n\nThe Valar quickly realized that with the Trees dead, their light survived only in the Silmarils. To restore the Trees and foil Melkor's malice, Yavanna asked Fëanor to give up the Silmarils so that they could be broken, and the light within them released. But Fëanor emphatically stated that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will, and proclaimed that if the Valar forced him to do so that they would be no better than Melkor. Ultimately however, Fëanor's selfishness made little difference, for a messenger from Formenos then arrived to deliver the news of Finwë's death and the loss of the Silmarils.\n\nFëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor \"Morgoth\", or \"Black Foe of the World\" (literally \"Black Enemy\"). As he did so, a great rage and despair gripped him, for his love for his father had run deep, and he fled in grief from the Ring of Doom. Now King of the Ñoldor after the death of his father, Fëanor returned to Tirion, ignoring the fact that he was still technically exiled, and gave one of the most impassioned speeches ever delivered in Arda. However, due to his rage, grief, and pride, he unwittingly filled his speech with many of the lies and half-truths of Morgoth. He railed against the Dark Lord, but he also blamed the Valar in part for Morgoth's deeds, claiming that they should have been able to stop him and had failed. He spoke of the fact that because Morgoth had attacked and badly marred the kingdom of the Valar without consequence to himself, there was neither bliss nor surety of safety to be found in Aman any longer. He evoked images of the kingdoms his people could build in Middle-earth, and the glory that could be theirs once they regained the Silmarils. Fëanor then swore an oath by the name of Ilúvatar himself that he would suffer none, no matter their race or reasons, to withhold a Silmaril from him, and that he would pursue with violence any who attempted it. The Oath of Fëanor was also taken by his seven sons below the tower of the Mindon Eldaliéva in the Great Square of Tirion. This oath was the cause for great tragedy for Fëanor's family, and for the Eldar in general.\n\nHis impassioned speech swayed most of those present, but even with his tremendous oratory skill, dissension quickly arose regarding who should lead the hosts to Middle-earth. For though Fëanor was technically High King, was not well liked amongst the Ñoldor, and many of them were not of mind to accept him as king. Greater love was given to Fingolfin and his sons, and most of the Ñoldor desired greatly that Fingolfin and his sons should go with them and lead them. Fingolfin was not eager to go, but he had sworn to uphold his brother's rights as the eldest, and furthermore he did not wish to leave his people to the mercy of Fëanor's rash and often selfish courses of action. Additionally, his son Fingon was eager to undertake the journey, and urged his father to come with him. Thus against his wisdom, Fingolfin marched with a second and larger host than Fëanor, while Finarfin commanded a third, smaller, and quite reluctant host. However even with the three sons of Finwë leading the way, about a tenth of the Ñoldor chose simply to stay in Tirion, some for the love of Tirion and others for love of the Valar.\n\nAfter delivering his speech and departing with his host, Fëanor's mood cooled somewhat and he belatedly realized that he had no practical means of delivering himself and his people to Middle-earth. For though Middle-earth and Aman were connected in those days by the Helcaraxë, a treacherous and bitterly cold region of shifting arctic ice, it was deemed to be impassable. Fëanor then gave thought to the building of ships, but there were no shipwrights amongst the Ñoldor and even had there been, crafting a fleet large enough to ferry all of his people to Middle-earth would have been a monumental and time consuming task. Fëanor therefore went to Alqualondë where the seafaring Teleri lived and attempted to persuade them to join him, or failing that, secure the use of their ships. But the Teleri had no desire whatsoever to leave Aman and would not give Fëanor their ships, for they held them too dearly. Fëanor angrily cited that the Teleri owed the Ñoldor for instructing them in the arts of crafting buildings and cities. But Olwë, the lord of the Teleri, was unmoved, and rebuffed again in friendship what he saw as great folly by Fëanor and his kin.\n\nBut Fëanor would not take no for an answer. He understood that many of his people had been inflamed by his impassioned words, and knew that haste was essential to keep cooler heads from swaying the Ñoldor to a more reasonable course. As such, he persuaded his host to aid him in taking the ships by force. This he attempted, and the Teleri resisted, casting many of the the Ñoldor into the sea and thrice driving them back despite being far more lightly armed than the Ñoldor. However, Fingolfin's host, which had been slower and less eager to start the journey, came upon the battle in progress. Believing that the Teleri had been the aggressors, perhaps on the orders of the Valar themselves, Fingolfin's host came to the aid of his brother's and the Teleri were overcome. The ships were stolen, and many of the Teleri mariners were wickedly slain. After commandeering the ships, the Ñoldor, their hosts lessened by battle and by terrible storms conjured by Ossë in vengeance for the Teleri, encountered a figure that may have been Mandos himself. This figure uttered a terrible Doom, exiling the Ñoldor from Valinor and foretelling that their war against Morgoth would cause them only misery. Due to their wickedness in slaughtering their kin, they would be utterly forsaken in the eyes of the Valar, and would receive neither welcome nor aid from Valinor in their struggles. Additionally, Fëanor and his house were cursed, and Mandos foretold great suffering and hardship would be their lot, due in no small part to the oath they had taken to regain the Silmarils at all costs. Above all, the figure made it explicitly clear that any war made by the Ñoldor against Morgoth would be utterly hopeless, for the Ñoldor, being Elves, did not have the power to overcome a Vala. Hearing this Doom, and having not participated in the Kinslaying, Finarfin and his host and turned back in grief, cursing Fëanor. They were pardoned and accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin ruled as High-King of the Ñoldor in Tirion. Fëanor, however, defied the Doom and proceeded onward. As such the journey northward continued, the land became ever darker, and the temperatures began to drop dramatically as the Ñoldor began to approached the Helcaraxë. Many of the Ñoldor, already reluctant to follow Fëanor, began to openly express dissatisfaction with his actions as conditions continued to deteriorate. Fëanor was all too aware of this and sought counsel with his sons. For despite having succeeded in seizing the Teleri fleet, the storms of Ossë had wreaked many of the ships, and there were no longer enough to bear all of the Ñoldor at once to Middle-earth. But due to fear of treachery, none were willing to be left in Aman while others crossed the sea first.\n\nHowever, Fëanor's most loyal forces had maintained control of the Teleri fleet after having seized it. As the dissent grew worse, Fëanor decided to simply abandon all those whose loyalty to him was not absolute, and he and his followers slipped away one night in the ships. They arrived at Losgar, in the land of Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, and upon arriving, Fëanor decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind. The earth, being flat in those days, allowed the remaining Ñoldor to see the flames, and they perceived that they were betrayed. Fingolfin now had the choice of either returning to Tirion in disgrace, or proceeding to Middle-earth across the treacherous Helcaraxë. Fingolfin and his people chose to attempt the crossing, as many of Fingolfin's host wished to continue and many, including Fingolfin himself, were eager to confront Fëanor and his people over their betrayal. The journey was a long and terrible one, and Fingolfin's host suffered great losses along the way, which added to the bitterness they felt for Fëanor and his sons.\n\nLearning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his fortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This confrontation was called the Battle under the Stars, or Dagor-nuin-Giliath, for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The Ñoldor won the battle handily, and destroyed Morgoth's armies. But Fëanor, exhilarated by the victory and ever prideful, pressed on toward Angband far ahead of his army with only a small vanguard. As he approached Angband, the Orcs, seeing that Fëanor's numbers were so few, turned and gave battle. Due to their proximity to Angband, they were reinforced by a number of Balrogs, who quickly slew most of the Elves. But Fëanor was undaunted, and though he was dealt many wounds, he long fought on alone. At last however, he was stricken to the ground by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs.\n\nFortunately for Fëanor, his sons arrived with a substantial relief force. The Balrogs returned to Angband, and Fëanor's sons took him from the battlefield. However, Fëanor knew that wounds were mortal, and bade his sons to stop. He looked upon Angband and cursed Morgoth thrice, but gazing upon the sheer scope of Morgoth's stronghold, he understood at last the truth of Mandos's words; that no force of the Ñoldor would ever overthrow the Dark Lord. Nevertheless, he instructed his sons to keep to their oath and avenge their father. As he died, his fiery spirit left his body and burned it to ash.\n\nOn Fëanor's passing, his son Maedhros became High King of the Ñoldor. Maedhros, however, met Fingolfin soon after and gave the kingship to him out of respect, a desire to keep his people united, and an acknowledgment that, as Finwë's oldest surviving son, the kingship ought to pass to him by right of birth. Fingolfin's descendents would reign over the Nôldor until the death of Gil-galad many centuries later. Fëanor's deeds, many of which were infamously despicable, cast a shadow over the interactions between the Silvan Elves and the returning Ñoldor. For Thingol, the King of Doriath, eventually learned of the kinslaying, the burning of the ships at Losgar, and the curse of Mandos. As the Teleri were of Thingol's own kin, he was enraged to hear of the merciless and needless slaughter. The sons of Finarfin he came to forgive, as they were of his own kin and had not participated in the evil. Those of Fingolfin's host, who had endured the horror of crossing the Helcaraxë after Fëanor's betrayal, he held as having suffered enough hardship to redress their ills. But all those who had followed Fëanor, were of his kin, or were friends of his kin, Thingol held in contempt and would have as little to do with as he could.

His true name had been forgotten, even by himself.","The Mouth served Sauron after Sauron came to Mordor. There is some dispute over the length of time this implies. If it refers to Sauron's most recent return to Mordor, the Mouth of Sauron would have served Sauron for some 68 years when he encountered Aragorn and Gandalf. But some have theorized that since Mordor \"first rose again\" during Sauron's return shortly after the destruction of Númenor, the Mouth of Sauron may be well over thousands of years old. Since no mortal could live that long, and Tolkien says explicitly that he was a living man and not a wraith, his age remains unknown. He could, however, be a mortal, but kept alive by some dark magic.","In the Peter Jackson's movie adaptation of The Return of the King, scenes with the Mouth of Sauron were filmed but cut from the original theatrical release. These scenes were later put back into the film in the extended edition. In the film, the Mouth of Sauron is decapitated by Aragorn, while he leaves back to the Gate and is never seen again in the novel. He was played by Bruce Spence and appears as a tall, monstrous Man wearing black, priest-like robes and a helm that bears the words \"Lammen Gorthaur\" (Sindarin for \"Voice of the Dread Abomination\") written in Cirth runes. This helmet covers most of his face with only his horribly disfigured and diseased mouth visible. His mouth was digitally increased in size for a more unsettling and memorable appearance.","He was played by the voice of Don Messick, who also did the voice of King Theoden and the Easterling captain in the movie.","He appears in both the radio programs done by the Mind's Eye and the BBC in 1979 and 1981, where he is voiced by John Vickery and John Rye. In the BBC's version, the Mouth is given an extended role and is the one who tortures Gollum into telling him why he came there and what he was looking for.","He appears as the first thing you fight in the battle of the Black Gate.","In the Good Campaign, the Mouth leads a small Mordor army consisting of orcs, two Attack Trolls, and a few Ringwraiths into the Eastern entrance. However, Dwarven phalanx battalions and Men of Dale anticipate the attack, and the Mouth and his retinue are slain. The defeat of the Mordor host attacking Erebor quickly follows suit.","In \"The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (GBA)\" game, the Mouth of Sauron is one of three Evil commanders that the player can choose for the entire game. In this game, the Mouth of Sauron gives out a decent amount of Command Points (1-3, plus Intimidate and Spoils of War). In addition, with all of his upgrades, he is a devastating warrior with base 10 damage, higher than any other hero except for Sauron himself. In essence, the Mouth of Sauron specializes in wiping out the enemy, whether he does it or his forces do.","The Mouth of Sauron is a mage type hero is this Battlefront style game. He is in the good campaign and is playable in the evil campaign and skirmish modes. His primary weapon, rather than being a sword, is Saruman's Staff of Orthanc. It is unknown whether he received this staff from Sauron as a reward or had a copy created for him with the same power, but maybe, it has been given by Sauron to him as he is the new Master of Isengard as it can be seen in the novel as in the Proposal of Sauron as \"Isengard will be given to Sauron and there will be a new Master of Isengard. Not Saruman. Someone more Reliable\" and they understand that the new master is the Mouth of Sauron. Either way, the Mouth uses the staff's power to its fullest extent, devastating his enemies with it. In melee, unlike other mages, the Mouth uses his staff to rapidly hit his opponents many times with high speed and power. This \"Barad-dûr Fury\" takes the place of the ShockWave. The Mouth is also able to briefly summon orc servants one at a time to release a single blow on any enemy. see: The Lord of the Rings: Conquest","The Mouth of Sauron appears as the penultimate boss (with Sauron's army being the final boss) in the Wii and PlayStation 3 version of Aragorn's Quest, and the player must fight him one-on-one, at the start of the last level, \"The Black Gate\"."],"name":"Mouth of Sauron","description":"The Mouth of Sauron's early history is unknown, as is his true name and how he first met Sauron. He was a Black Númenórean who briefly appeared in person when he haggled with the Army of the West in front of the Morannon, trying to convince Aragorn and Gandalf to give up and let Sauron win the battle for Middle-earth. Had the plans of Sauron succeeded, the Mouth of Sauron would have become the new lord of Isengard, replacing Saruman. When Gandalf turned down his proposal, the Mouth of Sauron set all the armies of Udûn upon them.\n\nThe Mouth of Sauron was the Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-dûr, and commanded the Orc armies of Gorgoroth. The Mouth of Sauron communicated directly with the Dark Lord. A man of great stature, potentially the equal of other Dúnedain, the Mouth of Sauron had fallen into darkness.\n\nThe Black Númenóreans had established their dwellings in Middle-earth during the years of Sauron's domination and worshipped him. The Mouth of Sauron entered the service of the Dark Tower when it first rose again (its rebuilding began in 2951 of the Third Age), and through cunning grew to power under Sauron and learned great sorcery.\n\nThe Mouth of Sauron appeared briefly before the host of the West prior to the Battle of the Black Gate. He insulted the host, asking who had authority to treat with him, and dismissed Aragorn's claim as King. But then Aragorn's gaze frightened him, and he cried out that he was a herald and an ambassador, and must not be attacked. Gandalf assured him he would not be, so the Mouth took Gandalf to be the spokesman. He then brought forth Sam's sword, a grey cloak with an Elven-brooch, and Frodo's mithril-vest, and said that the fate of the \"spy\" who carried them would depend on their actions, and insinuated that if they did not do as Sauron demanded, the \"spy\" would be tortured for many years.\n\nGandalf asked what the terms were, and the Mouth said that the Hobbit would be allowed to go free, so long as the captains follow Mordor's conditions: that the \"rabble of Gondor and its deluded allies\" withdraw beyond the Anduin River, swearing oaths \"never again to assail Sauron the Great in arms, open or secret\"; that all lands East of the Anduin River would belong to Sauron alone, forever; that all lands West up to the Gap of Rohan would pay tribute to Mordor; that they could no longer keep and bear arms, though Sauron would allow them to govern their own affairs so long as they helped to rebuild Isengard, which would be then ruled by a master more reliable than Saruman (presumably the Mouth himself). Gandalf replied that was too much for the ransom of one servant, and in any case he doubted that Sauron would keep his word. Gandalf demanded that the prisoner be brought forth, but of course the Mouth could not comply except to say, \"These are the terms. Take them or leave them!\" Gandalf responded, \"These we will take!\" and seized the Mithril coat, the cloak, and the sword, and utterly rejected Sauron's terms, before telling the Mouth to be gone, as they had not come to bargain with Sauron, much less with one of his slaves. Enraged and fearful at the same time, the Mouth fled back to the Gate and set Mordor's forces upon the West.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mouth_of_Sauron"}}

Although many, including Theoden, Hirluin and Forlong would fall in the battle, Húrin was amongst the survivors.\n\nLater, when Aragorn and Imrahil led the army of the west to challenge Sauron at the Black Gate, Húrin temporarily took on the title of steward of the city as Faramir was recovering from his encounter with the Witch-King. Húrin was left with a small garrison of men from the city in order to defend it should Sauron decided to bring more Haradrim up out of the south and assult it while the other captains rode towards Mordor. Húrin was aided in his defence of the city by Elfhelm, a marshal of Rohan and some two thousand men of Rohan. Their numbers were further bolstered by a great number of men that arrived out of Gondor's southern lands, led by Angbor the Fearless, who was the Lord of Lamedon. Due to this, the city under Húrin's stewardship was better manned that it had been before the Siege of Gondor had started.\n\nBy the time the army of the west returned in victory to Minas Tirith, Faramir had returned to health and had resumed the title of steward, and Húrin was back to being the warden of the keys.

Durin was set to sleep alone beneath Mount Gundabad in Middle-earth until the Elves awoke. The name Durin, like other names of Tolkien's Dwarves, was taken from Old Norse. In Tolkien's fiction, Dalish (the language of Dale) had the same relationship to Rohirric and Westron as Old Norse has to English, so since Westron was rendered in English, the language of Dale was rendered in Old Norse. The Dwarvish names were in the language of Dale, which therefore was rendered in Old Norse in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien took Durin's name, as with most other dwarf names in his work, from real Norse mythology (in which Durin was the name of the first of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves and the forger of many wonderful items).\n\nUpon his awakening at Mount Gundabad in the Years of the Trees, he traveled until he came upon the Mirrormere, the lake that the Dwarves call Kheled-zâram. He created there a great city within the Misty Mountains. This was Khazad-dûm, known by Elves as Moria.\n\nAccording to the Dwarves, Durin awoke at Mount Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains, which remained a sacred place to them ever after. Durin and his heirs were revered by all Dwarves, and not just those of his own line.\n\nDurin founded the line of Dwarves called Durin's Folk. Durin was called the Deathless because he lived far longer than any other known dwarf. It was also believed that Durin would be reincarnated a total of six times, each time as a descendant of an older Durin.\n\nLater, while passing through Moria with the Fellowship, Gimli sang a poem about Durin. \n\nLittle is recorded about the reign of Durin II (First Age ? - Second Age ?), although there are indications that the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm were in a confederation with the Men of the vales of Anduin, where the Men provided food in return for Dwarven weapons. This cooperation continued until the reign of Durin IV.\n\nDurin III (Second Age ? - Second Age ?) was the first bearer of one of the Seven Rings, although this was not known to outsiders until the end of the Third Age. The Dwarves of Durin's folk claim the ring was given by Celebrimbor himself, and not by Sauron, though Sauron was involved in the making. This was the ring that Thráin II carried and had taken from him when he was captured by the agents of Sauron.\n\nDurin IV (Second Age ? - Third Age?) lived in Khazad-dûm at the end of the Second Age or the beginning of the Third Age. Tolkien did not write anything about his reign.\n\nDurin V (Third Age ? - Third Age ?) lived in Khazad-dûm, and with the aid of the Ring, the kingdom prospered. He was the last of the Durins to have reigned in peace as King of Khazad-dûm without knowledge of the Balrog that slept beneath them.\n\nDurin VI (TA 1731 - TA 1980) was King of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm when the Balrog was roused deep beneath the city. The creature killed the king in year 1980 of the Third Age, and became known as Durin's Bane. He was succeeded by his son, Náin I, who was himself soon slain by the Balrog and succeeded by Thráin I.\n\nDurin VII, also known as Durin the Last, was held to be the last king of the line of Durin I. His birth was prophesied at the Battle of Five Armies, and he led Durin's Folk back to recolonise Khazad-dûm \"several centuries\" after the beginning of the Fourth Age, where they remained \"until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended\".\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Durin"}}

During his youth, the position of Steward was already a hereditary title. The stewardship had resided with his line since the days of his grandfather Pelendur. Mardil received the title of Steward on the death of his father Vorondil in TA 2029. His Stewardship began during the last part of the reign of King Eärnil II and throughout the reign of Eärnur, Eärnil's son.\n\nDuring Eärnur's reign as king, Mardil was charged with the difficult task of restraining the wrath of Eärnur to fight the Witch-king of Angmar, the chief of the Ringwraiths, who accused Eärnur after the Battle of Fornost of being afraid to fight him.\n\nThe King of Minas Morgul (one of the titles of the Ringwraith) reminded Eärnur of this and challenged him at the start of his reign TA 2043. Although Eärnur wanted to fight the King of Morgul he was restrained with difficulty by Mardil. However, when the Witch King issued another challenge with great insult seven years later in TA 2050, Eärnur would not be restrained and thus Mardil could not stop him from doing what he wanted to do. He marched to Minas Morgul and was never seen again.\n\nEärnur did not marry and thus had no children, so Mardil took it upon himself to rule Gondor. There was no one with a clear and unassailable claim to the throne, so the rule of the Stewards was a way of averting civil war. Because the fate of the King was unknown, Mardil made an oath to rule until \"the King returns\". This oath would be sworn by all of the Ruling Stewards. Mardil ruled Gondor with a steady hand and earned the nickname Voronwë, which means \"the Steadfast\" in Quenya.\n\nDuring his rule, the Watchful Peace began when Sauron retreated from Dol Guldur in TA 2063 and went back to Mordor. It was soon learned that Eärnur had met certain death at Minas Morgul, and upon Mardil's death in TA 2080 at the age of 120 years old, his son Eradan succeeded him as the second Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nAfter Mardil's rule his successors stopped using High-elven names in their official names.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mardil_Voronw%C3%AB"}}

While they lived there, Thorondor helped Fingon rescue Maedhros. Thorondor's folk later removed their eyries to the Crissaegrim, part of the Echoriath about Gondolin. There they were friends of Turgon, and kept spies off the mountains.\n\nThorondor wounded Morgoth in the face after Morgoth's battle with Fingolfin, and carried Fingolfin's corpse to the Echoriath, where Turgon buried him.\n\nThe Great Eagles fought alongside the army of the Valar, Elves and Edain during the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.\n\nIn the Second Age, a pair of Eagles had an eyrie in the King's House in Armenelos, the capital of Númenor, until the Kings became hostile to the Valar. The Eagles also watched the peak of Mount Meneltarma, and three Eagles would always appear when someone climbed to the summit.\n\nTowards the end of Númenor, the Valar sent storm clouds in the shape of Great Eagles in an attempt to warn them of their folly and impending doom.\n\nIn the Third Age, Thorondor's descendants Gwaihir and Landroval lived in an eyrie to the east of the Misty Mountains in Wilderland.\n\nThese Eagles helped the Elves of Rivendell and Radagast in watching the land and in gathering news about the Orcs.\n\nIn The Hobbit, no eagles were identified by name. Only the title Lord of the Eagles distinguished the eagle leader from other eagles in this story. Many readers assume that it was Gwaihir and Landroval who rescued Thorin Oakenshield and Company from a band of Wargs and Goblins, flying them to the river Anduin, and later assisting in the Battle of the Five Armies fought near Lonely Mountain. However, in Return of the King Gandalf says that Gwaihir has carried him twice before, while the proper count would be three times if Gwaihir and the Lord of the Eagles were the same individual.\n\nBefore and during the War of the Ring, Gwaihir rescued Gandalf the Grey from the top of Isengard\u2014having been dispatched by Radagast\u2014and again from Zirak-Zigil. The Eagles aided troops of King Elessar at the Battle of the Morannon at the Black Gate. The Eagles arrived in time to overthrow some Nazgûl, including Khamûl. Gwaihir, with others of his people, rescued Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee from Mount Doom in Mordor after the One Ring had been destroyed.\n\nThe Elves have various names for the Eagles, including the Sindarin thoron or thorn and the Quenya soron.\n\nTolkien's painting of an eagle on a crag appears in some editions of The Hobbit. According to Christopher Tolkien, the author based this picture on a painting by Archibald Thorburn of an immature Golden Eagle, which Christopher found for him in The Birds of the British Isles by T. A. Coward. However, Tolkien's use of this model does not necessarily mean that his birds were ordinary Golden Eagles. In some of his texts Tolkien speculated that these great Eagles were actually Maiar in bird-shape, as he felt it unlikely Ilúvatar would grant feär to animals. If this was true, then Roäc the Raven and the Thrush, who appear in The Hobbit, might also be Maiar or other spirits in animal form (and possibly even Beorn, who sometimes takes the form of a bear).\n\nIn earlier texts, Tolkien once envisioned the Great Eagles as bird-shaped Maiar. However, he had remembered that he abandoned the concept of the Children of the Valar, and that Gwaihir and Landroval were descendants of Thorondor during the events of The Lord of the Rings. Eventually, Tolkien decided that the Great Eagles were animals that had been \"taught language by the Valar, and raised to a higher level \u2014 but they still had no fëar.\"\n\nIn Peter Jackson's film trilogies (those of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings), the Eagles are much smaller than depicted in the book. They have been noted to been around 6m (20ft) tall, and have a wingspan of no more than 23m (75ft). Also, in the film adaptations, unlike in the books, the birds are not shown to be capable of speech. During the titular events of The Battle of the Five Armies, the Eagles carry Radagast and Beorn into battle against Azog's army; otherwise their role in the films is identical to that of the books, though the Eagle that carries Gandalf from Orthanc is summoned by Gandalf and not sent by Radagast.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Great_Eagles"}}

This activity caused him to become noticed by Agandaûr, who sought the giant out in the Ettenmoors and recruited him to the cause of Sauron, allowing the giant a large force to harass and strike at the Great Eagles nested there, as Agandaûr feared that the Eagles would prove a deadly adversary in his campaigns in the North.\n\nThe Stone Giant set about his work with efficiency- his troops were able to take a great deal of the Ettenmoors, and Bargrisar was able to lead a group of his trolls and giants into the Misty Mountains to strike at the Eagle's aeries, destroying many eggs and killing many. The Eagles were enraged, but Bargrisar was able to escape back to the Ettenmoors before they could slay him. Meanwhile, Gandalf traveled to the Moors and was unnerved to find no traces of Trolls in the area, prompting him to send the Fellowship of the North; Farin, Andriel and Eradan, to the location to investigate.\n\nAlong the way, the heroes met with their old ally from Fornost, Beleram, who had been sent with a band of Eagles to hunt and kill Bargrisar. Beleram explained the nature of Bargrisar's affiliation with Agandaûr, and the group worked together to confront the Giant. The three warriors on the ground were able to take out the Stone Giant's legs, allowing them to directly damage his face. After a long battle, the companions brought Bargrisar to the ground, leaving him apparently dead, but as they turned to return to Rivendell, the Stone Giant recovered and raised for a final strike, only to be interrupted by Beleram, who plucked out the Giant's eyes with his talons, violently ending Agandaûr's servant.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bargrisar"}}

In the previous year a two-pronged attack had been launched upon Gondor by the Haradrim and the Wainriders. In response, King Ondoher led the main army north to counter the Easterling invasion at Dagorlad and was defeated. Eärnil was commander of Gondor's southern army and guarded Pelargir. Eärnil led his army to the Crossings of the Poros where he won an astounding victory over the Haradrim. This enabled him to turn his attention to the invading Wainriders. The Wainriders, certain of victory, were celebrating their success before they would enter Minas Anor. They were unaware of Eärnil's victory in the south and were taken by surprise when Eärnil suddenly attacked them. As a result Eärnil won the Battle of the Camp.\n\nAfter the threat was eliminated Gondor's attention shifted towards Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, for King Ondoher along with his two sons were slain at Dagorlad. Both he and prince Arvedui of Arthedain (successor state of Arnor) claimed the throne. Arvedui based his claim on that he was the direct descendant of Isildur (second High King of Arnor and Gondor and uncle to Meneldil first King of Gondor), and as the husband of Fíriel, only surviving child of King Ondoher. The claim was rejected and Eärnil of the House of Anárion was elected king for his deeds, heritage, and because the Steward, Pelendur, claimed that \"The crown and royalty of Gondor belongs solely to the heirs of Meneldil, son of Anárion, to whom Isildur relinquished this realm. In Gondor, this heritage is reckoned through the sons only; and we have not heard that the law is otherwise in Arnor\". He reigned as Eärnil II.\n\nAside from being a gifted general Eärnil also was a wise ruler. He sent messages to Arvedui announcing that he received the crown of Gondor, according to the laws and the needs of the South-Kingdom, \"but I do not forget the royalty of Arnor, nor deny our kinship, nor wish that the realms of Elendil be estranged. I will send to your aid when you have need, so far as I am able.\" And at last in the autumn of 1973 Third Age, messages came to Gondor that Arthedain was in great trouble, and that the Witch-king of Angmar was preparing a final stroke against it. Then Eärnil sent his son Eärnur north with a fleet, as swiftly as he could, and with as great a strength as he could spare to aid Arvedui (now king). Eärnur arrived too late to save Arthedain and Arvedui who had fled north (and was drowned in the Ice-Bay of Forochel) but managed to defeat the Witch-kingdom of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost with the help of Círdan, the Lord of the Grey Havens and Glorfindel with an army from Rivendell. There, Eärnur earned the hatred of the Witch-king.\n\nHowever, Eärnil was not able to withstand the takeover of Minas Ithil by the Ringwraiths. Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard) and Minas Ithil was called Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery).\n\nEärnil died in TA 2043 after a rule of ninety-eight years and was succeeded by his son Eärnur, who was as good a general as his father but lacked his wisdom, and who would be the last king before Aragorn reclaimed his throne after a long gap.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/E%C3%A4rnil_II"}}

Their kingdoms spread throughout many mountains of Middle-earth; notable cities include Goblin-town near the High Pass above Rivendell, the Goblin-capital at Mount Gundabad, and the former Dwarf-kingdom of Moria, as well as those in the service of Isengard and Mordor.\n\nEven though goblins are portrayed as a very barbaric and tribal race their technology seems to be more advanced than other races in middle earth. In The Hobbit, Tolkien describes goblins as having dark technology. In the chapter \"Over Hill and Under Hill\" Tolkien states, \"It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosives always delighted them.\"\n\nGoblin weapons include scimitars, axes, and spears, as well as bows. The great goblin-soldiers of Isengard, the fighting Uruk-hai, are distinguished by their use of short, straight swords and long bows of yew.\n\nIn popular parlance, perhaps because the word goblins was used in The Hobbit (which was in many ways essentially a children's book), whereas orcs came across as more fearsome in Tolkien's later works, it has become common for many to distinguish goblins as different from orcs: smaller and less fearsome, or at least a smaller and less fearsome type of orc. This idea has gained currency through its widespread adoption in various adaptations of Tolkien's stories, as well as in many derivative fantasy worlds, including novels, movies, and games such as Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nThe animated Goblins appearing in this film are large, putrid green, bestial creatures. They are far bulkier than what one normally expects for a Goblin, being either hugely muscular or fat. They also had bulbous toad-like heads featuring tusks, lupine ears, canine-like noses, and even horns.\n\nThis 1980 animated adaptation attempted to explain to viewers the identification of goblins with orcs. Early in the movie, Sam is heard thinking, \"Orcs in the tower. Old Bilbo called them goblins. Whatever the name, I loathe the vile creatures.\" The Goblins\/Orcs in this film use much the same design as those seen in The Hobbit, but with more variations in shape and size, and a more bluish skin tone.\n\nIn the Peter Jackson movie The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), the Goblins have overrun the dwarven colony in Moria long before the events of the movie. When the Fellowship passes through the abandoned Dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf, Pippin accidentally alerts the Goblins to their presence, causing a fight to break out in Balin's Tomb. In this instance, their main weapon appears to be a Cave Troll, which has to be brought down by the whole Fellowship, but the entire force is wiped out by the end of the battle.\n\nHowever, the skirmish allows a much larger force of Goblins to close in on the Fellowship, who flee to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. Unfortunately for them, even more Goblins intercept them in one of Dwarrowdelf's great halls, emerging from cracks in the floor and holes in the ceiling to aid their comrades. Trapped in a sea of Goblins, the Fellowship could only prepare for death, but the evil creatures suddenly paused as a menacing roar echoed in the distance. As a distant hall lit with a fiery orange glow, the Goblins inexplicably fled in all directions, leaving the Fellowship to wonder at their fortune \u2014 as well as at what was coming next: Durin's Bane. In the book, Orcs are more effective fighters than in the film adaptation. It was an Orc chieftain who stabbed Frodo in the original story, rather than the Cave Troll shown in the movie, and Sam was also injured by another Orc. Haldir tells the Fellowship that Orcs will pursue enemies for long distances, even during the day, to avenge the death of a chieftain.\n\nThe Goblins of the High Pass seen in Peter Jackson's first installment of the Hobbit trilogy are quite different compared to the Goblins of Moria, having flesh-toned skin and riddled with various skin diseases and deformations like harelips, mismatched or skewed eyes, and crooked-growing fingernails. They are overall much more grotesque than Goblins seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, being as tall as any Dwarf or Hobbit. These types of goblins later appear in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies as \"goblin mercenaries\" adorned in armor and some riding Misty Mountain Trolls.\n\nIn the Hobbit, Tolkien describes orcs as a large variety of goblins, leading to the idea that goblins were of smaller build than orcs, although \"The Great Goblin\" and \"Azog the Goblin\" (as they were called in The Hobbit) were massive in size.\n\nIn the Peter Jackson films, being of the same stature as dwarves and hobbits, the goblins are depicted in appearing to lead a much more tribal life compared to the orcs, often having a chief among smaller groups. Compared to orcs, goblins are less organized and use a vast range of scavenged items of clothing, armour and weaponry. They also have a fear of light and the sun and will not step out in daylight most of the time.\n\nThere are two varieties of goblins: The goblins of the Misty Mountain and the goblins of Moria. The goblins of the Misty Mountain have flesh-colored skin and seem to be afflicted with various skin diseases and deformations that include hairlips and stunted growth. The goblins of Moria have a very green-colored skin tone compared to their Misty Mountain cousins with larger pointier ears and huge bulbous eyes that reflect their nature as cave creatures.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Goblins"}}

They were the first and mightiest beings created by Eru Ilúvatar in the depths of time before the beginning of the World."],"name":"Ainur","description":"The Ainur were the 'offspring of Ilúvatar's thought' and each was given understanding only of that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he or she came. The exception to this was Melkor, a brother in spirit to Manwë, who later became The Lord of the Valar and he was given some of the parts from which the others had come, but for all his gifts he did not know the full mind of Eru. Melkor and Manwë were the most powerful of the Ainur.\n\nThe Ainur were 'kindled with the Flame Imperishable', which can be taken to mean that they were granted free will by their Creator. Ilúvatar instructed them in the arts of music, until he brought them together to make the Music of the Ainur: the great song that created the Vision of Ilúvatar and ultimately the real world. In the beginning of the Music, the Ainur were all in harmony with Eru and one another, but Melkor turned instead to his own pride, seeking power for himself and bringing discord to the Great Music. He later led many of the Maiar astray as well.\n\nThrough the Music of the Ainur, Ilúvatar created a Vision of the World; he showed it to the Ainur, and explained much of its nature and destiny to them - the Ainur therefore have much knowledge of the World, but are not themselves omniscient. Ilúvatar then granted the World true being by declaring \"Eä\", causing these visions to come into being. Melkor and many of the other mighty Ainur desired to descend into it and form it in readiness for the coming of the Children of Ilúvatar (that is, Elves and Men).  Upon descending into the World, the Ainur became known as the Valar and the Maiar.\n\nThose Ainur who entered the World and chose to live in it at its beginning remain bound to it until its end. Though Melkor was eventually thrown into the Void by the others, he is prophesied to return before the end in the Dagor Dagorath, the final battle. Little is known of the ultimate future of the Ainur, even by themselves, but it is said that after the great battle at the end of the World, they will make a Second, even greater Music with the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\nAmong the many Ainur who entered the World long ago, there was one of the order of the Maiar named Melian. Alone of all the Ainur, she wedded one of the Children of Ilúvatar, King Elu Thingol of Doriath, and wove the Girdle of Melian that protected Doriath for many centuries. Through her, an essence of the Ainur entered the bloodlines of the Elves and Men, passed down through generation after generation, and was still present at the time of the War of the Ring. Elrond was Melian's great-great-grandson, and Aragorn, too, was her descendant, though through many more generations than Elrond.\n\nAinur is a Quenyan word originating from Valarin and means \"Holy ones\". It appears to come from the word aina, meaning 'holy'. Although the origin of the second element ur is less clear, it is possible there is a link between the word 'Ainur' and the word 'Eru' as the first element 'er' means 'one', though this may not be true as there is no further elaboration on this.\n\nThe singular form of Ainur is Ainu, simply meaning \"Holy one\".\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ainur"}}

Being an archer, he then joined Gaurwaith, a band of outlaws that hunted the forests to the south of river Taeglin, and was remembered as \"the grimmest among them\".\n\nWhen Túrin first appeared among the outlaws and slew one of their men, Andróg quickly perceived both Túrin's superiority and the Curse of Morgoth that followed him, but still esteemed him and became one of his closest followers. Later Túrin spared Andróg despite his participating in Forweg's attempt to trap Larnach's daughter, and Andróg supported him in becoming the leader of the band. After Beleg was captured by the outlaws, Andróg egged them to kill him, coveting Beleg's bow Belthronding, and he showed no favour to the Elf even after his release by Túrin.\n\nAndróg was the foremost in the attempt to capture the Petty-dwarves, seizing Mîm and shooting arrows at his sons. Once again, he wished to slay Mîm immediately, despising all dwarves, and misdoubted his gift of Amon Rûdh. Andróg was cursed by Mîm when it became known that his arrow slew Khîm:\n\nAndróg obeyed, fearing the Dwarf's curse, but prophecised in reply that Mîm will \"lack a bow at need ere his end\". Some time afterwards Andróg took up bow and arrows again, and was wounded by a poisoned shaft. He was healed by Beleg at Túrin's bidding, but continued to mistrust the Elf; Mîm's curse, however, was not put to rest thus. In fact this act made Mîm even more angry, because all Petty-dwarves hate Elves with a passion.\n\nDuring the Sack of Amon Rûdh Andróg lead some of the band to the top of the hill by a secret stair that he discovered some time before. There he fought more valiantly than any, but fell mortally wounded by an arrow. His son Andvír, however, survived the battle.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Andr%C3%B3g"}}

Hadhod lived in Erebor and had sons. At some point, Hadhod became friendly with Elrond and was gifted with a map which showed the way to the Dwarven kingdom of Moria. Unfortunately, his three sons journeyed to the mines with Balin, but were slaughtered. The knowledge of this turned Hadhod's heart to stone and he journeyed with his good friend, Elegost of the Dúnedain, to Moria with the map. He was aided by Berethor and his company while combating a cave-troll and joined them in their quest. Hadhod also makes an appearance as a home-made hero for the Dwarves in the The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II.\n\nLittle is known of Hadhod's past. He lived in the Dwarven haven of Erebor and had three sons whom he loved deeply. He was also friendly with Lord Elrond of Rivendell, who gave him a map which showed the way to the dwarven kingdom of Moria, as a token of their friendship. Around this time, his three sons journeyed to the mines with Balin, who possibly sought to destroy the halls of Moria. Unfortunately, Hadhod's sons were slaughtered. The knowledge of this turned his heart to stone and he followed the map towards Moria. He met Elegost, a Dúnedain Ranger, and the two became fast friends and travelling companions. While venturing across Caradhras, they came across Mordor Orcs who sought to stop them. Hadhod and Elegost fought valiantly, but an avalanche created by Saruman the White separated them, and swept Hadhod down the mountain towards Eregion.\n\nWhile in Eregion, Hadhod came across a cave-troll in the forest and was attacked by it. Fortunately, Elegost, along with Berethor of Gondor and Idrial of Lórien, helped him slay the foul creature. He then joined the trio in order to continue his journey to Moria, fighting many Orcs along the way. Finally, when the company reached the entrance to the mines, they were attacked by the Watcher in the Water before they could try to open the door. After defeating the water beast, its tentacles collapsed and smashed open the entrance into Moria. Hadhod and the others fled inside and saw what remained.\n\nWhilst inside the mines, Hadhod and the Company confronted the Watcher in the Water once again and possibly slaughtered it before retreating further into the caves. They found seven Dwarven Runes which they used to open a chest containing a set of purple Dwarven armour which Hadhod donned. Elegost also found the last axe ever forged from Erebor the goblins have stolen, which he gave to Hadhod before they located the Balrog's fiery pit. They attempted to follow the creature out of the mines, but it destroyed the pathway. Then, a skeleton fell from the ceiling with a key embedded in its ribs. Idrial asked what the key was for and Hadhod answered that it was the key to Moria's Book of Secrets, which they found in the throne room not long after. The Book revealed the password (\"The Road is too dangerous\") to get out and located the hidden door by where they found the armor. Now in Eastern Moria, they found Balin's tomb, as well as the Balrog of Morgoth, which attempted to destroy the company, but they continued to go onwards, towards the Bridge of Khazad-dum. Hadhod and the trio followed it and assisted Gandalf in defeating the evil beast. Unfortunately, before the Balrog fell into the abyss, it used its whip to pull Gandalf down after it. The company then retreated from Moria towards Eastemnet (which is impossible as the bridge was destroyed and there was no other way out).\n\nLittle is known of Hadhod's family except for his sons, who ventured with Balin to Moria. It was said that they were killed there. Being of the Clan of Fundin, he is likely a relative of Balin, Oin, Glóin and Gimli.\n\nDuring the time of the death of his sons, he would meet and befriend Elegost, a Dúnedain. They soon became travel companions and stayed for a while until a group of orcs and a bewitched avalanche separated them. Elegost remained in the pass, hunting mountain wargs, until his meeting with Berethor and Idrial, and the company of Gimli and the rest of the Fellowship in Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith.\n\nHadhod is friendly toward Berethor, Morwen and Eaoden, but initially appeared to share the elf-dwarf prejudice with Idrial, similar towards the initial interaction of Legolas and Gimli. Similarly towards Legolas and Gimili it's most likely that throughout the course of the game that Hadhod and Idrial shared a bond and friendship similar to that of Gimili and Legolas.\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring it seems that he is still traveling with Elegost, most probably staying either in Gondor or Helm's Deep (if he stayed with Gimli); in either case it is unknown what became of him and it is possible he did not survive the collapse of Barad-dur (if he and Berethors company were still in the tower when it collapsed).\n\nHe is incredibly strong and steadfast, like the rest of his race, making him the tank of the group, proving to be a valuable ally to the team. His axe or hammer (depending on which weapon he is equipped with) will cleave through many of the most powerful enemies in the game (not to mention the devastating effect of his spirit powers, if trained properly). Also, his defence and constitution will guarantee he survives even the greatest blows, making him good to use against the more powerful enemies like the Mûmakil and trolls. However, his magic resistance and his action pool are rather low, unlike the other members of the company, meaning he probably should not face foes like the Nazgûl shadow chieftains.\n\nHadhod used several weapons while he was in Berethor's group. To this end he used several axes and even the mighty hammer of Helm Hammerhand, one of the former kings of Rohan, and the one for whom Helm's Deep is named. Before the battle of the Hornburg, he and Elegost found this mighty hammer. This War-hammer, made of Mithril, was more of a ceremonial weapon and had lain unused at the Hornburg for centuries, since Helm preferred to fight with his bare hands. Elegost concluded Helm wanted to repay the Dwarves for their little-known help in fortifying Helm's Deep. Hadhod replied \"some deeds need no thanks, but this was almost too easy,\" and gladly accepted the hammer. He also used several axes his kin Gimli used, probably Gimli dropped some axes and thus Hadhod picked them up and used them with the same deadliness. Here is a list of Hadhod's weapons in the game:\n\nHadhod: Well, Ranger, it's about time! (when Elegost and his two new companions finally find Hadhod, who's in battle with a troll)\n\nHadhod: Stand back! It shall be a dwarf who first sets foot here. (As the company is about to enter Moria.)\n\nElegost: (after killing a goblin) Sometimes the little ones are the hardest to kill.\n\nHadhod: I might resent that remark...but I think you're right.\n\nHadhod: (When the Watcher in the Water clears the rubble leading into Moria) Excellent, he is digging a way in!\n\nHadhod: Heh... I knew he was good for something!\n\nGoblin: Who dares? ( As the company enters the throne room.)\n\nHadhod: ( Rushing into battle ) I think I do!\n\nHadhod: (talking about the Balrog) He melts the very rock! I have never seen such power.\n\nIdrial: What could be inside this sarcophagus?\n\nHadhod: It is the last of their kin, if you must know.\n\n(Arrow fires) Hadhod: Tomb guards! It's a ambush!\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hadhod"}}

He had a son Théodred, whose mother Elfhild died in childbirth.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring, Théoden had been king for nearly 40 years, and was becoming old and tired. He was increasingly misled by his chief adviser Gríma (or Wormtongue as most others in the Mark called him), who was secretly in the employ of Saruman the White. Gríma may even have been poisoning Théoden. In the last years before the War of the Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands, and Gríma gained an increasingly large hold over him. Rohan was troubled again by Orcs and Dunlendings as well as the new fighting Uruk-hai, who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from Isengard.\n\nWhen Théoden's son Théodred was mortally wounded at a battle at the Fords of Isen in skirmish with the Orcs of Saruman, his nephew Éomer became his heir. Éomer fell out of favor with Wormtongue and was eventually banished from Rohan.\n\nWhen Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli appeared before him, Théoden initially rebuked Gandalf's advice to resist Saruman, but after being released from the effects of Gríma, he commanded Hama to release his nephew and bring him his sword, and led the Riders of Rohan into battle against Saruman but having found that Saruman's forces had broken through Rohan's outer defenses. Théoden, under advice from Gandalf, retreated and fought against Saruman's hordes at the Battle of Helm's Deep. After this, he became known as Théoden Ednew, the Renewed, because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.\n\nBefore the battle, Théoden had made a favorite of Merry, and expressed great interest in hearing more about the Shire, especially Hobbits' lore surrounding pipe-weed. He led the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields bravely charging the legions of Sauron, where he won great glory by defeating \"The Black Serpent,\" a chieftan of the Southrons, in single combat.\n\nHe challenged the Witch-king of the Nine Ringwraiths, and was unconscious when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by the Ringwraith's fell beast.

Before that, in the First Age, the Atani from whom the Haradrim descended were known as Black Men. A part of the histories of the Westlands is given to the fierce people who in the Second and the Third Age of the Sun, came from the hot deserts and forests of sunlands, which lay in the South of Middle-earth. These people were ruled by many and lords, until in time Sauron the Maia corrupted them and called them to war."],"name":"Haradrim","description":"During the Second Age the Men of Númenor built a great city in the firth of Umbar, a vast natural harbour on the southern shores of the Bay of Belfalas, eventually turning the city into a fortified citadel from whose gates the Men of Númenor could levy great tributes upon many of the tribes of Harad.\n\nFor many years, the Haradrim were the greatest enemy of Gondor. Several times, they invaded the north. Finally, the Men of Gondor were able to capture Harad, though it was later freed. During the War of the Ring the Haradrim were allied with Sauron. A Haradrim warrior wounded Faramir. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the 18,000 Haradrim were a great threat to the Rohirrim that had come to aid the people of Minas Tirith. During the onslaught a Haradrim chieftain, who bore the standard of a black serpent on a scarlet field, led the Haradrim cavalry. King Théoden of Rohan slew him in single combat.\n\nOnce Sauron was destroyed, the Haradrim, Variags, and Easterlings disbanded from the Black Gates and out of Mordor, and became dispersed.\n\nThe name Haradrim means \"South-people\", from the Sindarin harad (\"south\") and rim (\"host, group\").\n\nOther names were Southerns, Southrons.\n\nTheir appearance is somewhat ambiguous, but The Two Towers gives a detailed description of a slain Haradrim warrior that Frodo and Sam encounter. He is described as having swarthy skin and black hair that is braided with gold. He wore a scarlet robe, as did the other warriors, and a gold collar. His weapon and armour are simply described as a sword and a corslet of brazen plate.\n\nThe lands of the Haradrim lie to the south of Gondor past the river Poros. These hardy people lived in one of the harshest environments in Middle-earth. In the land south of Gondor, the sun beat down unrelentingly, cooking much of Haradwaith into desert.\n\nHaradrim towns and cities presumably existed nearer to the coast where fish and sea trade allowed a more urban existence, as well as a haven for pirates and corsairs.\n\nThe Haradrim are said to be skilled archers and horsemen. In battle, they usually drove their Mûmakil into the enemy's ranks, causing terror and panic; with their foes in disarray, the Haradrim then flung spears and fired arrows down upon them from the covered canvas frame atop the Mûmak. Usually this would be enough to rout their foe, but if not the main host charged in behind the great beasts, using their spears, swords and bows with bloodthirsty zeal. In The Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Haradrim use Mûmakil to rout the forces of Rohan. As the Mûmakil were accustomed to and effective against cavalry, this rout was initially successful. However, strategic use of bows and spears and the arrival of reinforcements (book) or Army of the Dead (movie) summoned by Aragorn eventually destroy the Haradrim's forces at Pelennor.\n\nMuch of Harad's impressive army was wiped out on the expanses of Pelennor Fields, during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, in which Harad's forces amassed one of the greatest legions their land had ever seen, containing many thousands of men, all armed with bows, spears or the reins of the Mûmakil. With Sauron defeated, many Harad peoples sent emissaries to the court of King Aragorn, and peace talks began; however, many other Haradrim tribes continued hostility with Gondor.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the Haradrim are inspired by Aztecs and Kiribati tribes, according to the ROTK DVD's Weta Workshop documentary. Their bows, possibly of compound design, were made out of composite materials like antlers and wood and used bamboo arrows from leather or bamboo quivers. The apparent leader of the Haradrim force is killed in the film not by Théoden, but by Éomer.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Haradrim"}}

He entered the service of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, at a young age. Hador was loved by the King, and he rose high in the esteem of many of the Eldar. Eventually, Hador would even become a part of Fingolfin's own council. Realizing the need for the Edain to live under their own lords and have lands of their own, Fingolfin granted as a fief to Hador the land of Dor-lómin (land of echoes) which thus made him the first Lord of Dor-lómin. Hador gathered most of the people of the Third House into that land, which lay in Hithlum between the Kingdom of Fingolfin and his eldest son Fingon. There, Hador's people became numerous; and he encouraged the use of the Sindarin tongue.\n\nHador continued to win renown among the Eldar as the Lord of Dor-lómin, as well as among Men. Two of Hador's children, Galdor and Glóredhel, were wedded to two of the children of Halmir Chieftain of the Haladin, respectively Hareth his daughter and Haldir his son of the House of Haleth, when the two peoples met for a great feast. Fingolfin also gave to Hador a great helm made by Telchar of Nogrod. It was made in the likeness of the dragon Glaurung, and came to be known as the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin; it could only be borne by one of great stature and strength. In the year 455 of the First Age, Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in the Dagor Bragollach. Hador fought alongside Fingolfin with what few warriors of the Third House he could gather against the swift onset of Morgoth's forces. He was slain, however, defending the retreat of his lord. His younger son, Gundor, fell beside him before the fortress of Eithel Sirion. It was said that their deaths were greatly mourned by the Eldar.\n\nThough he was accounted one of the mightiest chieftain of the Edain in the First Age, Hador is not well-known aside from being the namesake of the Third House of the Edain. However, he was the forefather of many other heroes. His grandsons were Hurin and Huor. His great-grandsons were Túrin and Tuor Eladar, and his great-great grandson was Eärendil the Mariner. Aragorn Elessar, as well as all the Kings of Númenor, Gondor and Arnor were descended from Hador. Maybe the best thing ever said regarding the legacy of Hador was this passage, written by J.R.R.

They are called the Afterborn (Quenya Atani, Sindarin: Edain) by the Elves.\n\nMen bear the Gift of Men, which is mortality, and therefore they age and die when their time comes, and are susceptible to illness and disease. Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to aging and disease. Even if their bodies are slain, their spirits will remain bound to the world for as long as it lasts, and pass to the Halls of Mandos to wait until they are released or the world ends.\n\nThe Elves called the race of Men, in Quenya Atani, literally meaning \"Second People\", but also Hildor (Aftercomers), and Fírimar (Mortals) or Engwar (the sickly).  They were also called the Usurpers, the Strangers, the inscrutable, the Self-cursed, the Heavyhanded, the Nightfearers and the Children of the Sun.  The name Atani became Edain in Sindarin, but this term was later applied only to those Men who were friendly to the Elves.\n\nTerms used in the First Age to refer to Men who were not Edain were Rhevain and Hravani, which both translate as 'the Wild'. The Black Men and the \"Swarthy Men\" (who would also be known as the Haradrim and the Easterlings, respectively) were both held to be races of this distinction.\n\nAlthough all Men of Middle-earth were related to one another, there were many different groups with different cultures. The most important group in the tales of the First Age were the Edain. Although the word Edain refers to all Men, the Elves use it to distinguish those Men who fought with them in the First Age against Morgoth in Beleriand from others.\n\nThose Men who fought with them against Morgoth in the First Age were divided into three Houses. The First House of the Edain was the House of Bëor, and entered Beleriand in FA 305 and were granted the fief of Ladros in Dorthonion by Finrod Felagund. The Second House of the Edain, the Haladin was led by Haldad, and later by his daughter, Haleth, and settled in the Forest of Brethil. The Third House, which became the greatest, was led by Marach, and later his descendant, Hador, and they settled in Dor-lómin. This house was known both as the House of Marach and the House of Hador.\n\nOther Men didn't cross the Misty Mountains or fight against Morgoth. Some, such as the Easterlings, fought openly on his side. Later on, the Haradrim would fight on Sauron's side against the descendants of the Edain. Below follow short descriptions of the most important groups of Men in the First, Second, and Third ages.\n\nFor their services and assistance rendered to the Elves and the Valar in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, the Edain were rewarded with a new land of their own between Middle-earth and the Undying Lands. This was the island of Númenor, an island far away from the evil of Middle-earth.\n\nThe Edain were led to this island by Elros with the help of his father Eärendil, who sailed the heavens as the bright star of the same name. Once there Elros became the first king of Númenor as Tar-Minyatur and the Edain became known as the Dúnedain (Sindarin for Men of the West). The kingdom of Númenor grew steadily in power and the Dúnedain became the noblest and highest of all Men on Arda. Allied to the Elves, Númenor fought against Morgoth's lieutenant Sauron.\n\nNow that the Men of the West had become powerful they came to resent the Gift of Men, Death. They wanted to become immortal like the Elves, and enjoy their accumulated power for all time. The Númenóreans turned away from the Valar, began to call the Gift of Men the Doom of Men and cursed the Ban of the Valar which forbade them to sail west beyond sight of Númenor or to enter Valinor. In SA 2899 Ar-Adûnakhôr became the first king of Númenor who took his royal name in Adûnaic, the language of Men instead of Quenya, the language of the Elves. This led to civil war in Númenor.\n\nThe people of Númenor were divided into two factions: the King's Men, who enjoyed the support of the King and the majority of the people. They favoured Adûnaic as language. The minority faction, the Faithful, were led by the lord of Andúnië, the westernmost province of Númenor, and favoured Quenya. Sauron who by the second millennium of the Second Age was nearly defeated by the Elves and Numenoreans, took advantage of the division. He surrendered to the last Númenórean King, Ar-Pharazôn and worked his way into the King's counsels. Ultimately, Sauron advised him to attack Valinor and claim immortality. This he foolishly did, and as a punishment Númenor, the island of the Men of the West fell and only the Faithful escaped and founded the twin kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor.\n\nBefore the fall of Númenor, however, as it was growing in naval power, many Númenóreans sailed east and founded colonies in Middle-earth. In the second millennium of the Second Age there was an exodus of Men from overcrowded Númenor. The King's Men migrated because they wanted to conquer more lands, and the Faithful because they were persecuted by the Kings. The Faithful settled in Pelargir and the King's Men settled in Umbar. When Númenor was destroyed the King's Men became known as the Black Númenóreans and remained hostile against the Faithful of Gondor. From their ranks Sauron recruited the kings who would become the nine Ringwraiths in the second millennium of the Second Age. Umbar was conquered by Gondor in TA 933.\n\nAmong the Black Númenórean race was the wicked Queen Berúthiel, wife of Tarannon Falastur, King of Gondor.\n\nFurther east of Umbar another group of Men lived, the Haradrim. They were dark skinned Men and waged war on great Oliphaunts or Mûmakil. Hostile to Gondor, they were subdued in TA 1050 by Hyarmendacil I.\n\nBoth Umbar and the Harad were left unchecked by Gondor's waning power by the time of the War of the Ring, and presented grave threats from the south. Many Haradrim fought with Sauron's forces in Gondor in that War.\n\nCorsairs Pirates who hail from the havens of Umbar are masters of the sea and ships. Although they were due to fight for Sauron in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, they were mysteriously delayed and their ships were hijacked by the Dead Men of Dunharrow. After the fall of Sauron, the corsairs were not even punished by the West because they were mercenaries.\n\nVariags Although Variags do not appear in the films, it is confirmed that they came from Khand, south of Rhun . They were excellent horsemen and, like the Easterlings , they had wains. They had brown skin and handlebar mustaches and chest-length beards.\n\nMost of the Men who fought in the armies of Morgoth and Sauron were Easterlings, who came from the region around the Sea of Rhûn. Some Easterlings offered their services to the elvish kingdoms in Beleriand, among them were Bór and his sons and Ulfang the Black and his sons. This proved to be disastrous for the Free Peoples in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad when Ulfang and his clan switched sides and defected to Morgoth, while Bor and his sons died bravely fighting on the side of the Elves.\n\nAfter Morgoth's defeat Sauron extended his influence over the Easterlings and although Sauron was defeated by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men at the end of the Second Age, the Easterlings were the first enemies to attack Gondor again in TA 492. They were soundly defeated by King Rómendacil I, but invaded again in TA 541 and took revenge by slaying King Rómendacil. Rómendacil's son Turambar took large portions of land from them. In the next centuries Gondor held sway over the Easterlings. When Gondor's power began to decrease in the twelfth century Third Age, the Easterlings took the complete eastern bank of the Anduin except Ithilien crushing Gondor's allies, the Northmen.\n\nThe Easterlings of the Third Age were divided in different tribes, such as the Wainriders and the Balchoth. The Wainriders were a confederation of Easterlings which were very active between TA 1856 and TA 1944. They were a serious threat to Gondor for many years, but were utterly defeated by Eärnil IIin1944. When Gondor lost its royal dynasty in TA 2050 the Easterlings started to reorganize themselves and a fierce tribe called the Balchoth became the most important tribe. In TA 2510 they invaded Gondor again and conquered much of Calenardhon, until they were defeated by the Éothéod, coming to Gondor's aid.\n\nUntil the War of the Ring, the Easterlings didn't launch any further invasion. During the War of the Ring, they were amongst the fiercest warriors deployed at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields by Sauron himself.\n\nThe Northmen were composed of two principal groups. First, not all the Men who remained east of the Blue Mountains and Misty Mountains were tempted by Morgoth or Sauron. They were joined after the War of Wrath by those of the Edain who did not wish to travel to Númenór (similar to how, at the end of the first age, various eldar remained and went east, becoming lords of the silvan elves). The Northmen who dwelt in Greenwood the Great and other parts of Rhovanion were friendly to the Dúnedain, being for the most part their kin, and many of them became Gondorian subjects. The Men of Dale and Esgaroth were Northmen, as were the Woodmen of Mirkwood, and the Éothéod, who became the Rohirrim.\n\nWhen Elendil founded the Kingdom of Arnor its borders were quickly extended towards the river Greyflood (Sind:Gwathló), and Gondor likewise extended up through Enedwaith. In Enedwaith (Middle-land) and Minhiriath (Sindarin for Land between the Rivers) lived a group of Men related to those Men that became the House of Haleth, and they were known as the Dunlendings. They had lived in the great woods that covered most of Eriador, and when the Númenóreans started to chop these woods down to build their ships in the Second Age, the Dúnedain of Númenor earned the hostility of the Dunlendings. The Dunlendings later became bitter enemies of Rohan. The Dunlendings served Saruman in the War of the Ring and participated in the Battle of the Hornburg.\n\nAnother group of Men were the Woses or Druedain. They were small and bent compared to other Men. The Woses had brown to black skin. They lived among the House of Haleth in the First Age, and were held as Edain by the Elves, who called them Drúedain (from Drûg, their own name for themselves, plus Edain). At the end of the Third Age some Woses lived in the Drúadan forest, small in number but experienced in wood life. They held off orcs with poisoned arrows and were vital in securing the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King Elessar granted the Drúadan Forest \"forever\" to them in the Fourth Age.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Men"}}

Sauron meant to, and succeeded in his goal of corrupting the powerful Nine. The Nine took them and used them to achieve great power, wealth, and prestige in life. But as time passed, the Rings continued to exert their corrupting influence. The Rings eventually left the kings spectral, invisible to all but those who could see into the wraith world, and slaves to the will of Sauron. Their lives and power became bound to Sauron's via the One Ring; as Sauron grew or diminished in power, so too did the Nazgûl.\n\nOnly two of the Nine were ever named: the Witch-king of Angmar and Khamûl the Easterling.\n\nThe Nine were first seen around 2251 of the Second Age, and soon became established as Sauron's primary servants. Despite being Sauron's most useful servants, not much is known of their activities during the Second Age. They were temporarily dispersed after Sauron's downfall in SA 3434 during the war of Last Alliance of Elves and Men, losing the ability to maintain any sort of physical form as Sauron did after losing the One Ring. However, the Ring was not destroyed, and as such, both the Nazgûl and Sauron were able to endure.\n\nThe Nazgûl re-emerged around 1301 of the Third Age as Sauron at long last began to take shape after his defeat at the hands of the Last Alliance. It was around this time that the Witch-king established himself in Angmar and began to launch attacks against the nearby kingdom of Arnor, which had fractured into three smaller kingdoms due to infighting. His first target was the realm of Rhudaur. After conquering Rhudaur and replacing the Dúnedain king with one of the native Hillmen in the year TA 1356 the Witch-king moved against Arthedain, resulting in the death of King Argeleb I.\n\nBut Arthedain was not yet defeated, and it managed to maintain a line of defense along the Weather Hills. In TA 1409 came the attack on Cardolan. Also during this time, the forces of the Witch-king burned and destroyed the watchtower of Amon Sûl. After the fall of Cardolan, Angmar's advance was slowed by resistance from the elves of Lindon and Rivendell. By TA 1974, Angmar arose again and captured Arthedain's capital of Fornost, and with that the last kingdom of Arnor was destroyed.\n\nA year later, a prince of Gondor named Eärnur arrived with the intention of aiding Arthedain.\n\nHowever, Eärnur arrived too late to be of help in defending any of Arnor's territories. Instead, he and his army sought revenge against the Witch-king. He and his forces marched against the armies of the Witch-king and utterly destroyed them during the Battle of Fornost. With the destruction of his forces, the Witch-king escaped and retreated to Mordor. Despite the complete annihilation of Angmar, the campaign was accounted a tremendous success by Sauron, for the territories formerly occupied by Arnor became essentially wilderness, with the Dúnedain Rangers being all that stood between its people and complete lawlessness. At some point, the Barrow-wights left Angmar and Rhudaur to occupy the Barrow-downs of Cardolan. Upon his return to Mordor, the Witch-king gathered the other eight Nazgûl. In the year TA 2000 the Nazgûl attacked, and after two years conquered Minas Ithil (which was renamed Minas Morgul), acquiring a Palantír for the Dark Lord.\n\nIt was from Minas Morgul that the Nine directed the rebuilding of Sauron's armies and the preparation of Mordor for their master's return. In 2942 Sauron returned to Mordor, openly declaring himself by TA 2951. He sent three of the Nazgûl to garrison his fortress Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. They were led by Khamûl, the second most powerful of the Nazgûl behind the Witch-King.\n\nNear the beginning of the War of the Ring in TA 3018, Gollum, a Stoor who had once owned the One Ring, was captured and tortured in Mordor. From him, Sauron learned of the location of the One, and the family identity of those who had kept it. Having learned this, Sauron released Gollum, but Gollum was soon recaptured by Aragorn, captain of the Rangers of the North. Learning of this, Gandalf the Grey went immediately to interrogate the creature and discovered that Sauron now knew where the Ring was and who had it; the hobbit Frodo Baggins. Accordingly, Gandalf advised Frodo to leave the Shire and make for Rivendell, taking the Ring with him. However, Sauron wasted no time in attempting to capture the Ring, sending all of the Nine to retrieve it.\n\nSoon the Nazgûl entered the Shire, where they learned the Ring was in the possession of Bilbo Baggins' nephew, Frodo Baggins. Subsequently, after searching for Frodo, one of the Nine, Khamûl the Easterling, had his first encounter with him.\n\nAs Frodo and his friends, Sam, Merry and Pippin, took Bucklebury ferry to reach Crickhollow, Khamûl, who had narrowly missed them, was forced to go around to the Brandywine Bridge instead. Shortly after this, the Nine arrived at Frodo's new home in Crickhollow.\n\nThough Frodo had already left for Bree by the time the Nine arrived, they were soon given information regarding Frodo's whereabouts by Bill Ferny, a spy of Saruman. Consequently, the Nazgûl attacked the village of Bree, where Frodo was located. However, during the time it took the Nazgûl to reach Bree, Frodo and company fortunately encountered Aragorn himself, who had been asked by Gandalf to watch for the hobbits and aid them if he could.\n\nUnable to find the Hobbit, the Nine left Bree, and at Weathertop several days later they encountered Gandalf the Grey, who was scouting nearby on his way to Rivendell to meet up with Frodo. An all-night battle commenced at Weathertop between the Nazgûl and Gandalf. Though Gandalf was able to escape, four of the Nine pursued him, while five remained near Weathertop. Several days later, Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry made camp at the base of the ruins of Amon Sûl.\n\nDiscovering them, the five Nazgûl attacked the group. As they confronted the four Hobbits, Frodo put on the Ring and attempted to resist the Nazgûl. The Nazgûl leader quickly stabbed Frodo with a Morgul-blade, but the Nazgûl then fled because Aragorn arrived carrying firebrands, and also perhaps (as Aragorn surmised) because the Nazgûl were unprepared for Frodo's show of resistance.\n\nRegrouping, the Nazgûl continued to pursue Frodo. Eventually, they caught up with him, then riding the horse of Glorfindel. Chasing Frodo until they reached the Ford of Bruinen, the nine Nazgûl, now reunited, demanded Frodo give them the Ring. Frodo refused and defied them. Provoked, the Nazgûl crossed the river to take the Ring by force from a weak and injured Frodo. However, the water, enchanted by Elrond and Gandalf, formed a great wave and swept the Nine away, killing their horses. Lacking the means to successfully attack Rivendell, where Frodo and his companions took refuge, the Nazgûl were forced to retreat to Mordor on foot and stop their hunt for the Ring.\n\nReturning to Mordor in complete failure, the Nazgûl were forced to abandon their hunt for the Ring. At this point, the Nine received new mounts to replace their horses: Fell beasts. With his new mount, the Witch-king attacked the ruined city of Osgiliath with an army of Orcs and secured it. After this, he made way for the assault on Minas Tirith, leading Sauron's forces during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. During the battle, the Witch-king confronted Gandalf the White when attempting to enter the city. However, before the Witch-King could engage Gandalf in battle, the forces of Rohan arrived. The Witch-king immediately left Gandalf to deal with the new threat against Mordor's forces.\n\nThe Witch-King attacked King Théoden on the battlefield. As Théoden was crushed by his horse, the lord of the Nazgûl prepared to finish him off. However, Théoden's niece Éowyn and Meriadoc Brandybuck rode up on horseback and she confronted the Witch-king.\n\nEngaging the Witch-King in battle, Éowyn killed the Nazgûl's fell beast. The Witch-king, however, was unaffected by this and attacked Éowyn with his mace. After breaking Éowyn's arm, the Witch King prepared to kill her, but Meriadoc stabbed him in the leg from behind with his Barrow-blade, which was of Westernesse make. Injured, the Witch-king screamed in pain and Éowyn stabbed her sword into his crown and body, thus killing the lord of the Nazgûl and fulfilling the prophecy of Glorfindel.\n\nDuring Battle of the Morannon the remaining eight Nazgûl, mounted on Fell beasts, attacked the Army of the West. Eventually, however, the Nazgûl were confronted by the Eagles, led by Gwaihir.\n\nSimultaneously, Frodo Baggins claimed the Ring for himself near the fires of Mount Doom. Sauron immediately became aware of Frodo, as well as his own folly. Enraged and frantic, Sauron ordered the Nazgûl to fly with all possible speed to Mount Doom and seize the Ring.\n\nHowever, the Nazgûl failed; the Ring was cast into the fires of Mount Doom when Gollum bit Frodo's finger and accidentally fell into the Cracks of Doom himself, with the ring. Sauron was immediately defeated by the loss of the Ring, Mount Doom underwent a gigantic volcanic eruption and all eight Nazgûl were destroyed, their form and power dissipating forever.\n\nThe Nazgûl were sustained by the power of Sauron. The Witch-king in particular was difficult to slay, for any weapon that struck him would be destroyed. The Nazgûl's own weapons included long swords of steel and daggers. Their leader possessed a powerful black mace as well. Their arsenal of deadly armaments was not confined to physical means; they also had powerful voices, which brought terror into the hearts of mortals and a general aura of dread. They wore hauberks of silver mail and had enhanced senses of hearing and smell.\n\nThe Nine could not see during the day as mortals do; instead they see shadowy forms. During the night they see many signs and forms invisible to mortal eyes; it is at night that they are to be feared most. They can smell the blood of living things that they desire and hate. Their presence can be felt as a troubling of the heart, and they can more keenly feel the presence of others. At all times, they sense the presence of the Ring and are drawn to it.\n\nThey were surrounded by an aura of terror, which affected all living creatures; their aura (called the Black Breath) could be toxic to those hapless enough to come near them. Of course, their horrible cries put many a battle-hardened warrior to flight as well. Some of the Nazgûl appear to have been accomplished sorcerers and used magic to devastating effect. The fear the Nine inspired was one of their greatest strengths. According to Gandalf, if Sauron regained the One, they would become vastly more powerful. However, it is unclear as to how. However, as Sauron's strength grew through the books, the Nazgûl became obviously more powerful. In the Fellowship of the Ring, the Nazgûl's cries were simply unnerving to the hobbits (this may possibly be explained because it was important that the Hunt of the Ring remained in secrecy so they might have diminished their auras, and they did not have the rings of power), and they appeared to be physically weak, as Aragorn managed to hold off five of the Ringwraiths single-handedly on Weathertop. In The Return of the King however, their cries are powerful enough to send all but the most stout-hearted of Gondor's defenders into a state of helpless terror, and the Witch King in particular has become so powerful that he challenged Gandalf the White (which of the two is the more powerful is not revealed).\n\nThough the Ringwraiths were among the greatest of Sauron's servants, they also had certain weaknesses that could be used against them. One of these was daylight itself. With the exception of the Witch-King of Angmar, none of them (especially Khamûl) could operate as well under the Sun and generally feared it.\n\nAll the Ringwraiths but the Witch-King feared water, although it seems this weakness was abandoned by Tolkien in the published version because it was an idea difficult to sustain.\n\nAt Weathertop, Aragorn used fire to drive the Ringwraiths away from Frodo. Even the Witch-King feared fire; though it's possible it had less of an effect on him over the other eight Nazgûl. At the Ford of Bruinen, Aragorn and the hobbits that accompanied Frodo used it to assist Glorfindel and drive the Ringwraiths into the raging water.\n\nIf an enemy was strong enough so to resist their aura of dread, then the Ringwraiths (with the exception of the Witch-King) had little real power over them individually.\n\nHeroes of Middle-earth such as Aragorn, Gandalf, and Glorfindel could single-handedly face a Ringwraith and defeat or at least elude them, provided that they were not confronted by multiple Ringwraiths or the Witch-King. However, only a few could resist them all at the same time. But it has also been seen that legendary heroes like Glorfindel can instill fear in the hearts of the Nazgûl too.\n\nAt the start of the War of the Ring, the nine Nazgûl rode black horses descended from horses stolen from Rohan, which they relied heavily on for transport. However, after the encounter with Glorfindel at Ford of Bruinen, the Black Riders lost their horses, which were killed in the flood.\n\nReturning to Mordor by foot to regroup, the Nazgûl received winged creatures from Sauron in addition to new horses. With these fell beasts, the nine attacked the ruined city of Osgiliath in order to clear the way for a siege on Minas Tirith. Subsequently, the Nazgûl used the fell beasts to their advantage at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and the Battle of the Morannon, but most of all in attempting to seek and find the ringbearer, Frodo.\n\nThe term Nazgûl, which literally means \"Ringwraith\", comes from the Black Speech words nazg (\"ring\") and gûl (\"wraith\").\n\nThe rarely used Quenya name for Nazgûl is Úlairi; from this it can be conjectured that the Sindarin term is Ulaer.\n\nThe Nazgûl appear in Prancing Pony to slash the beds of the Hobbits. After this, the Nazgûl remove their hoods, revealing black masks and armor underneath.\n\nThe Rankin-Bass adaptation of The Return of the King also featured the Nine, but with drastically altered appearances. With the exception of the Witch-king, all the Ringwraiths appear as hideous, skeletal humanoids riding black horses with red eyes and bat wings. They notably wear black cloaks and brown tunics that bear the red eye insignia of Sauron, with black crowns atop their heads. The Witch-king shares this outfit save that he initially appears hooded, and upon removing his hood a crown and glowing red eyes are visible but no head. The Witch-king initially appears riding a winged horse, but later rides in atop a Fell beast to attack the body of Theoden before being slain by Éowyn.\n\nThe Nazgûl portrayed in the films are emphasized with their deafening shrieks, provided by Peter Jackson's partner and co-screenwriter Fran Walsh. Andy Serkis voices Khamûl who briefly speaks in The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nStorywise, the Nine are largely unchanged from their novel roles, with the most notable changes taking place in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and centering on the Witch-king. Here he is only seen riding his Fell beast mount, and never without his hood; he is also established in the film's extended edition as being more powerful than Gandalf the White, shattering his staff during a brief confrontation.\n\nAccording to IMDB, the Nazgûl were portrayed by the following actors: Victoria Beynon-Cole, Lee Hartley, Sam La Hood, Chris Streeter, Phil Grieve, Jonathan Jordan, Semi Kuresa, Clinton Ulyatt, Paul Bryson, Lance Fabian Kemp, Jono Manks and Ben Price. Thomas McGinty and Kate O'Rourke are uncredited. It is unknown which one of them portrayed which Nazgûl.\n\nThe Witch-king of Angmar appears in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in Dol Guldur, where he briefly fights Radagast, dropping his Morgul-blade, which Radagast shows to Gandalf and which Gandalf then shows to the White Council in Rivendell. Galadriel and Elrond are alarmed by the dagger's appearance, knowing it was buried with the Witch-King in his tomb, which they believed could not be opened.\n\nIn The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Galadriel sends Gandalf to the Ringwraiths' tombs in the High Fells, and find each of them has been broken open from the inside. This is enough to convince Gandalf that the Necromancer of Dol Guldur is in fact Sauron in disguise, as the Nine only answer to him.\n\nIn The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, the nine Ringwraiths appear in armored, ghostly versions of their mortal selves after Galadriel rescues Gandalf from his cage in Dol Guldur. The Nine fight against Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond and are seemingly banished by them. Radagast arrives to take Gandalf to safety. But after a few moments, Sauron appears with the Nine hovering before him. The Witch-king floats forward to stab Galadriel, but she quickly takes the shape she did in The Fellowship of the Ring and banishes the Nine, leaving only Sauron. After a short duel Sauron flees towards Mordor together with the Ringwraiths.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game, which is based on the film trilogy, gave the Ringwraiths other than the Witch-king titles consisting of the word Úlairë, which is another term for Ringwraith, and a number. Thus, the other eight wraiths are identified as Úlairë Attëa (two), Nelya (three), Cantëa (four), Lemenya (five), Enquëa (six), Otsëa (seven), Toldëa (eight), and Nertëa (nine).\n\nThe Games Workshop model company give each Ringwraith a particular title as well as backstory and personality. As well as The Witch King (the best match for this particular Nazgûl is Isilmo) and Khamûl, the other seven are named as: The Dark Marshal, The Betrayer, The Shadow Lord, The Undying, The Dwimmerlaik, The Tainted and The Knight of Umbar.\n\nThe Dark Marshal - The most black-hearted and unrelentingly cruel of all the Nazgûl, his name is a byword for misery and death. Where the Dark Marshal passes, evil creatures fight harder, fearful of their lives whilst good warriors feel the icy touch of death upon their hearts. By his armour it is guessed that he is one of the three Númenórean Ringwraiths (the best match for this particular Nazgûl is Herumor or Fuinur)\n\nThe Betrayer - Cursed long ago for yielding the Southlands to Sauron's rule, the Betrayer is driven by malice and self-hatred that knows no bounds. Of all the Nazgûl, the Betrayer is amongst the lowest of Sauron's lieutenants, for even the Dark Lord is wary of placing trust in one who betrayed his kin so readily. The Betrayer was once one of the Haradrim, as seen by the ancient turban that he still wears.\n\nThe Shadow Lord - The Shadow Lord was once the king of a small and insignificant kingdom. When Sauron offered him one of the Nine Rings, the promise of its power proved irresistible. Now, his physical being all but gone, and his will enslaved to Sauron, the Shadow Lord wears his dark pride like a cloak, blotting the sun from the sky and dimming the sight of his foes.\n\nThe Undying - Originally a great sorcerer, The Undying endured longest when others fell under Sauron's sway. He is said to be the oldest of the Ringwraiths, and the last to succumb to the wasting influences of the Rings of Power. Through an obsessive mastery of evil magics, the Undying has learnt to draw sustenance from the magics of others, fortifying himself with the magical energy that flows around him.\n\nThe Dwimmerlaik - The Dwimmerlaik is possibly the most mysterious of all the Nazgûl, for scant record of his past deeds exist in the tomes of the Wise. Yet in Rohan, this particular Ringwraith is feared beyond all others, for he has been a blight upon that realm for centuries untold, directing the Dark Lord's minions against the Sons of Eorl. Because of him a person is quite possible to be blinded by greed.\n\nThe Tainted - Where the other Nazgûl were slowly swallowed by the taint of their rings, the Tainted gave himself wholly and willingly to Sauron. Now all natural things rebel in his presence, vegetation withers, animals sicken and bold warriors cower. He is an abomination whose merest presence is poison to life, honour and hope.\n\nThe Knight of Umbar - The third of the Númenórean Lords to become one of Sauron's servants, the Knight of Umbar's past is shrouded in mystery. If the rumours pertaining to him hold any truth, he was once one of the great Númenórean kings who ruled the Southlands prior to the days of the Last Alliance. (the best match for this particular Nazgûl is also Herumor or Fuinur who came from Numenor island to the south during the second age, eventhough either one or both of them became the Lords of Haradrim. It is also known that, both Haradrim and Umbar were in league to destroy Gondor)\n\nThe Ringwraiths each received unique names and backstories in MERP, though Khamul remained as the Black Easterling. The Witch-king was identified as the Black Númenórean prince Er-Mûrazôr, while the other seven unnamed Ringwraiths were named Dwar of Waw, Ji Indûr Dawndeath, Akhôrahil, Hoarmûrath, Adûnaphel, Ren the Unclean, and Ûvatha. Akhôrahil and Adûnaphel were also Black Númenóreans, with the latter surprisingly being a woman.\n\nThese names were also used for their appearances in the Middle-Earth Collectible Card Game.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king dubbed one of the Ringwraiths as Morgomir. The One Ring also gave titles to the three wraiths sent to Dol Guldur by Sauron: the Lieutenant of Dol Guldur, the Ghost of the Forest, and the Messenger of Mordor.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Nazg%C3%BBl"}}

He served as the Steward of Angmar during the War of the Ring, as well as his emissary after the Fall of Fornost. He is the final boss when raiding the Carn Dûm instance. A Wraith, he used to be a Man before the Witch-king of Angmar transformed him into an evil being."],"name":"Mordirith","description":"Mordirith was not always evil. He started as Eärnur, the Witch-king's greatest foe. A powerful captain and last king of Gondor before its decline, Eärnur led armies against nearly impossible odds, but in the end defeated Angmar though too late to save Arthedain and Arvedui. Several years after the battle the Witch-king sent him a challenge to a personal duel, which he refused, but seven years later it was sent again, calling him a coward. Eärnur had not forgotten the Witch-king's taunting during the Battle of Fornost, and he rode with a small company to Minas Morgul.\n\nHe and his company were never seen again. In The Lord of the Rings Online he was turned into a Wraith, presumably by the Witch-king's Morgul-blade. He was sent to a rebuilt Angmar to rule as the Witch-king's right hand and steward.\n\nMordirith was bound by a dark magic, making him a Wraith of darkness, personally answerable to the Witch-king. This Wraith-state meant he was, like the Nazgûl, suspended between life and death. On defeat he would always reshape in Minas Morgul and be reclothed to return. His powers were much like his master's from whom he claimed to receive his strength: He could summon and quench flames, create wraiths of his own, inspire debilitating terror, see far with his mind, repel any magic that came against him, weave powerful illusions, dominate lesser minds and become invisible (though as the steward of Angmar he rarely did the latter). He was also adept at politics, strategical warfare and influencing susceptible minds.\n\nHis presence and efforts were a great hindrance to the warriors of Middle-earth as they fought him during the War of the Ring.\n\nMordirith's part in the War was extremely straightforward: Raise an army to devastate Eriador, and then march on Gondor to meet with his dark master at the Battle of Minas Tirith, overwhelming the White Tower. At first, he did his part well, making alliances with many groups such the Blackwolds, Southrons, Ongburz orcs, and Wights of all kinds. He was not without foes, however, the greatest among these being, Lorniel, Laerdan, and the game's protagonist, the Player.\n\nThe Player first came into direct conflict with him when he entered Angmar just before the Fellowship left Rivendell. There he met up with Lorniel and Laerdan, who were chiefs of a hidden group of rangers in that kingdom. Lorniel and the Player attacked Mordirith at Carn Dûm via a secret route, but were defeated by his power. The Player escaped with the prisoner Golodir, whose mind was broken and would weigh down the rangers, but Lorniel (who was, in fact, Golodir's daughter) was killed at the Gate.\n\nMordirith was confident of his victory but still prepared for an attack by a vengeful Golodir and the Player. He did not expect, however, for Golodir to wield a weapon such as the Rivendell-forged sword Dunachar and was overcome by its mighty light, the Player's prowess, and his own overconfidence. Though the blade broke in the effort, it pierced Mordirith's chestplate and delivered a fatal blow. After Mordirith's first defeat his Palantír and stewardship were claimed by Amarthiel, Champion of Angmar.\n\nHis spirit driven to Minas Morgul, Mordirith begged his master for forgiveness and a chance to exact his revenge, but was bidden to wait. The Witch-king waited and watched as Amarthiel led Angmar as its new steward, but she was more intent on reclaiming her lost Narchuil, one of the Lesser Rings of Power, than on ruling Angmar effectively. When her ineptitude nearly caused Angmar's downfall at the Player's hands, Mordorith was sent back to resume his rule. Amarthiel then refused to give up her new station and attempted to use Narchuil's power on Mordirith. He defeated her and allowed his servant Mordrambor to take both Narchuil and her place as Angmar's new Champion. He quickly restored Angmar to its former glory and launched assaults across Eriador, believing that without Dunachar no one could stop him.\n\nAmarthiel, who had been thrown down from her position as Stewardess of Angmar, repented and reclaimed her old Elven name Narmeleth, once again joining the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Together with the Player she received a broken Dunachar from Golodir. The two snuck into the caverns beneath Barad Gularan, and in a great fury attacked Mordirith. During the battle the Steward of Carn Dûm summoned many illusions of prominent casualties from her reign as Amarthiel, including her own father Laerdan and her caretaker Sara Oakheart. Narmeleth eventually she lost her will to fight. Believing his victory to be complete, Mordirith finally ceased his illusions and showed his true form, throwing a fatally wounded Narmeleth to the floor. Mordirith gloated that no one would remember Narmeleth, but that the name Amarthiel would forever live on in history as a great Hero of Angmar, as would her father; Laerdan the Fool who caused Eriador's downfall. Enraged by his words, Narmeleth used Dunachar's broken hilt to stab Mordirith in the empty hood of his robes, ending his second reign. Narmeleth died of her wounds shortly after.\n\nMordirith was not in books or the films and was a character created solely for The Lord of the Rings Online as a boss character.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mordirith"}}

This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the First Age where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Morgoth, fought their own Elvish kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.\n\nMaglor took part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and he made the lament Noldolantë, the Fall of the Noldor, in memory of the terrible event.\n\nIn Beleriand, Maglor and his brothers followed their father and fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. Fëanor managed to disperse the armies of Morgoth but pressed on to Angband with his sons. Fëanor was mortally wounded and his sons bore his body back to Mithrim. As they drew near Eithel Sirion, Fëanor passed away after cursing Morgoth thrice.\n\nMaglor and his brothers traveled toward the east of Beleriand. Maglor founded the area between the hills surrounding Himring and Blue Mountains, called Maglor's Gap. Years later, the dragon Glaurung passed Maglor's Gap and destroyed the lands about. Maglor and his people fled to Himring to join Maedhros before the Dagor Bragollach took place.\n\nAfter the Dagor Bragollach, Bór's people came into Beleriand. He and his sons Borlach, Borlad and Borthand swore allegiance to Maedhros and Maglor.\n\nFollowing the taking of the Silmaril by Beren and Luthien, Maedhros had formed the Union of Maedhros, an alliance between Elves and Men. Under him, Maedhros' host held the east to draw out the army of Angband while Fingon and his host would attack from the west. During the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Ulfang betrayed the Eldar and Edain. Maglor slew Uldor, son of Ulfang. The Union of Maedhros was broken and though the brethren were all wounded, none were slain. They escaped to Mount Dolmed in the east. After the battle, they took a woodland life in Ossiriand.\n\nMaglor and his brothers learned when Dior, the new King of Doriath, possessed a Silmaril and refused to give them the jewel that had been won by Beren and worn by Lúthien. In the Sack of Doriath, Maglor's younger brothers Celegorm, Curufin and Caranthir were killed, and the Silmaril was not recovered.\n\nAfterwards, Maglor and his surviving brothers dwelt on Amon Ereb in East Beleriand. Hearing that Elwing, the wife of Eärendil, had escaped from Doriath with the Silmaril and was now living at the Havens of Sirion, the brothers did not act at once, repenting against their destruction of Doriath. But after a time, remembering their oath, they sent messages to the Havens of Sirion that offered friendship while demanding that the Silmaril be returned to them. And when these demands were refused, they mounted an attack on the Havens with their remaining followers, thus perpetrating the Third Kinslaying that resulted from the accursed Oath of Fëanor.\n\nAlthough they won the fight, after spilling much of their kin's blood, they did not obtain the Silmaril for Elwing escaped over the Great Sea with it. After the carnage of the cruel bloodletting, Maglor and his brother Maedhros came upon the two young sons of Eärendil and Elwing, Elrond and Elros. With so much blood already on his hands, Maglor took pity on them and would not allow them to be slain. So, in the absence of their parents, he took them into his household and raised them as if they were his very own children.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory, though the circumstances and date of his death, if it ever happened at all, are unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Maglor"}}

Her thought also met with Manwe's, setting the arrival of the Great Eagles.\n\nIn the beginning of days, Yavanna planted the first seeds of Arda and watched over the Olvar and all growing things. As Morgoth was corrupting her beloved creatures, she contended with him and supported all the plans against him. After his expulsion from Arda she planted the seeds that she had long devised and life came to Middle-earth during the Spring of Arda, although in the beginning no flowers bloomed.When the Two Lamps were destroyed much of the life on Middle-earth slumbered in the Sleep of Yavanna that lasted until the rising of the Moon and the Sun.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Lamps the Valar withdrew to Aman and created Valinor. Upon the green mound of Ezellohar, Yavanna sat and sang while the other Valar sat and listened. Her song, with the aid of the tears of Nienna brought forth the Two Trees, her greatest creation, which gave light to the land. However, Yavanna did not forsake the Outer Lands; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Morgoth and urged the other Valar to wage war on him before the Awakening of the Elves.\n\nAfter Eru allowed Aulë's creations, the Dwarves, to survive, Yavanna feared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Aulë, in reply, told her that even Elves and Men, the true Children of Ilúvatar would have need of her trees as well. Yavanna lamented to Manwë, questioning whether anything she had made would be free from the dominion of others. Manwë brought her concerns before Ilúvatar in prayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Yavanna: He answered her plea by creating the Ents to protect the trees.\n\nWhen the Elves built Tirion upon Tol Eressëa Yavanna fashioned the tree Galathilion, a lesser image of Telperion , for the court beneath the Mindon.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Trees Yavanna examined their remains and told the other Valar that if she could use the light of the Silmarils she could heal them. This light she was denied by the will of Fëanor. Doing what she and Nienna could, they managed to bring forth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit from Laurelin. She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels for them and thus created the Moon and the Sun.\n\nFor the Men who had stood with the Valar in the War of Wrath the land of Andor was raised by Ossë, established by Aulë, and enriched by Yavanna. When the Edain came to this island they created the realm of Númenor. In the later centuries, when the Valar decided to send emissaries to the mortal lands, Yavanna begged the Maia Curumo to take her servant, Aiwendil, with him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yavanna"}}

This is a matter of lively academic debate; there are some who say that we must believe what Tolkien's son says about his intention, and therefore Gil-galad was the son of Orodreth, and others who say that the The Silmarillion says he was the son of Fingon, and therefore we must go with the published canon.

He first appears in the history of the Eldar when he travels from Cuiviénen with Oromë as ambassador of the Teleri to see the land of Valinor. Interestingly, since Thingol had previously visited Valinor as an ambassador of the Teleri, he is debateably both of the Sindar and of the Calaquendi. Upon his return, he manages to convince many of his people to follow him back to that country. On the Great Journey to the West, the Teleri lag behind, and do not arrive at the coast until after the departure of the moving island of Tol Eressëa. Thus, they stay in Beleriand for many years until Tol Eressëa is brought again to fetch them. By this time, many of the Teleri have grown to like Beleriand, and decide to stay there. Elwë is among them, having encountered Melian the Maia in the woods of Nan Elmoth and fallen deeply in love with her. Afterwards, he disappeared for many years causing many of his people to linger in Middle-earth or stay there until he could be found.\n\nFor centuries Elwë remained lost until he reemerged as a respected lord and many of his people joined him in the great forested area of the Beleriand. Now known as Thingol, he and Melian become king and queen of the Teleri who stay in Beleriand, who then become known as the Sindar. He founded a realm in a large forested area in the Beleriand first known as Eglador (Land of the Forsaken). During these early days under the stars, Thingol and Melian have a daughter named Lúthien, who is said to be the fairest woman ever to have lived.\n\nAs Lord of Beleriand, he welcomed his long lost kin now known as the Laiquendi or Green-elves vast lands in Ossiriand which they would name Lindon. He was also the first elf to make contact and alliances with the Dwarves of Belegost who helped delve the caves of the great Fortress\/City of Menegroth which became the capital of Thingol's kingdom. When the Dwarves first became aware of unknown but savage creatures coming from out of the North, Thingol was the first to know about it and not having any heavy weapons of war he once again asked the Dwarves for their aid. They forged for him weapons and armour he needed to fight them.\n\nWhen Melkor returned to Middle-earth, he sought once again to master Middle-earth and its peoples and declared war on them. He sent his great hosts of Orcs into the Beleriand starting what became known as the First Battle of Beleriand. Thingol led his people to victory against the Orcs successfully driving them out of his kingdom and most of the Beleriand. Afterwards, Melian set the Girdle around his kingdom which would be known from then on as Doriath which no one could enter without his permission. When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he gave them leave to dwell in the north part and dealt only with the House of Finarfin as they were kin through his brother Olwë. When he learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, he was outraged and wanted nothing to do with most of the Ñoldor and their war and even outlawed the use of Quenya in his kingdom.\n\nThingol was drawn into the war with Morgoth and the deadly Oath of Fëanor when after the Dagor Bragollach (Battle of Sudden Flame), Lúthien fell in love with a man named Beren. Thingol did not wish for the two to be wedded to each other, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked the race of Men. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth, thinking there was no way that Beren could fulfill this demand. Thus, Thingol was drawn into the quarrels over the great jewels and ultimately the doom of Fëanor.\n\nIt was, however, this very bride-price that doomed him. After Húrin brought the treasures of Nargothrond to Doriath, Thingol summoned Dwarves of Belegost to Menegroth and invited them to work the treasure into jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.\n\nThe Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above all but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost finished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves of Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the Silmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.\n\nEnthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the Dwarves demanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them. Thingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an impertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves attempted to slew him. After a long battle between dwarves and elves inside the city, dwarves were driven out of the city, two escaped to Nogrod and persuaded the city to march on Doriath. They escaped and told a much different story to their home cities and got them to march on and sack Doriath. Later with the help of certain treacherous elves also possessed of the cursed treasure they regained entrance past the Girdle. Thingol was lured out on a hunt with but a small company of arms, where he was ambushed by waiting dwarves, and was slain. The fortress of the Thousand Caves was taken at unawares and plundered. They could not seize nor harm Melian, and she left to seek Beren and Lúthien.\n\nThingol's heir was Dior Eluchil, the son of Beren and Lúthien.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Thingol"}}

When looting Rohan earlier in the Third Age, they are led by a Dunlending named  Wulf son of Freca."],"name":"Dunlendings","description":"In the years of the Second Age before the Númenóreans settled in Middle-earth, the tribal Hill-men inhabiting the lands west and south of the Misty Mountains, as far down as the valleys surrounding the White Mountains.\n\nWary of the men who came out of the west, they came to fear and hate them. They were hunted and persecuted in such numbers that they had dwindled by the start of the Third Age. At this time they had come to congregate in the valleys of the White Mountains and the grassy plains of Dunland, which lay west of the Misty Mountains between Moria and Isengard; a few went north, and became the ancestors of the Men of Bree. Dunland then became the area most populated by these men, who came to be called Dunlendings.\n\nWhen Eorl and his people were granted Calenardhon --- Rohan, as it would later be known --- in TA 2510, they drove the Wild Men from their new lands, earning their bitter hatred and enmity. The Wild Men were also driven from the White Mountains by the Men of Gondor. During the next five hundred years these shorter, dark-haired warriors made frequent attacks upon the outlying settlements of Rohan, exacting revenge upon the usurpers, whom they called \"straw-heads\" because of the high number of blond warriors among them.\n\nAs a consequence, Rohan maintained patrols and garrisons to the west of the Fords of Isen to try to limit the number of raids, although these patrols had virtually disappeared under Wormtongue's stewardship, to the point where Saruman's forces could make incursions almost at will.\n\nYet not everybody took against the Wild Men. At some point near the end of the thirtieth century of the Third Age, Saruman made contact with them and swayed them to his side by playing on their resentment and hatred of those who had taken what was theirs.\n\nSaruman welcomed to Orthanc a large warband of these Dunlendings. Saruman evidently convinced them that they could reclaim what had been taken, and during the early part of TA 3019, a fearsome raiding force comprising Dunlendings, Orcs and Uruk-hai left Isengard and began ravaging the western settlements of Rohan. Previous attacks by Orcs and Uruk-hai had killed many Rohirrim at the Fords of Isen, so there were no warriors to defend against the surprise attack.\n\nMany people of Rohan were killed in these attacks, but the raiders never made it across the country to Edoras; it is fair to assume that they encountered one or more Éoreds, companies of mounted warriors, who would have been patrolling the interior. After the defeat of Isengard at the Battle of the Hornburg, the Rohirrim spared the surviving Dunlendings and used them as workmen to repair the broken walls of the Hornburg.  The Rohirrim's mercy surprised the Dunlendings, as Saruman had convinced them the Rohirrim would slaughter them all if given the chance. When Gandalf, Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck, and  Pippin Took were traveling through Dunland on their way back towards the the Shire, the Dunlendings in that area hid from them. After the War of the Ring, the Dunlendings sent ambassadors to the court of King Aragorn, thus finally began peace and diplomacy between Gondor and Rohan with the Dunlending realms.\n\nThe Dunlendings were hill-folk used to living in harsh conditions, often seen in leather garb and fur cloaks. They may have been related to the Snowmen of Forochel in the north. They were a tough, hardy people, big and powerful with long, unkempt hair and beards. The Dunlendings, because they lived in the hilly and forested area of Dunland, most likely hunted, foraged, and fished for food, with agriculture being a lesser form of food production.\n\nThe Dunlendings, due to their way of life, probably were very skilled with bows. Dunlendings are also described as using cavalry at the Fords of Isen. Most Dunlendings probably fought, however, on foot, with long spears, axes and other melee weapons (as with most self-arming forces, swords were expensive and therefore a rarity).  Armour for most soldiers was light, but well-off warriors and chieftains likely made use of chainmail and were clad similarly as their Rohirrim counterparts.\n\nThey Dunlendings are used as units or powers which Isengard and the Goblins can use for 10 power points.\n\nThe Dunlendings appear as both enemies and allies in this game, and, like most Hill-men in the game, are based loosely on Celtic tribes.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dunlendings"}}

He accompanied his father in all political, financial and military matters and was his only son and heir. In the movies, at some point of his lifetime(before TA 2770), he lost an eye.\n\nHe married sometime before TA 2746 and had three children: Thorin, Frerin and Dis.\n\nThráin fled with his father, his three children, and the surviving Dwarves of Erebor when the Dragon Smaug descended on the Lonely Mountain TA 2770, destroyed the kingdom and claimed it as his own along with all the treasures and gold inside. Together with the other survivors, among them his father and his children, Thráin began a long homeless exile. They wandered farther south and they eventually settled in the hills of Dunland. There, they remained for twenty more years where they were forced to make a mangy living.\n\nYears after the destruction of the kingdom of Lonely Mountain, a life of poverty took a toll on the mind of King Thrór and he became restless and desperate. He sought to journey away in search of a scrap of wealth but he did not specify Moria. At their parting, he gave to his son Thráin his Ring of Power as well as the map of Lonely Mountain. He departed from his people with a single companion, his only and old friend named Nar.\n\nNar would return to their dwelling in Dunland many weeks later, but he would mysteriously return alone. He told the tale to Thráin of what had become of his father Thrór. Thrór had brashly ventured into Moria, despite the pleas of Nar to not go forth, but he did not return. Days later, it was revealed that the king had been branded and murdered by Azog the Orc who claimed to now rule the ancient mansions of Durin's Folk.\n\nWhen Thráin heard Nar's recounting of what had become of his father, and that an Orc was ruling their ancestral home, he wept and tore his beard, and then fell silent. For seven days he sat and said no word. Then on the seventh day he stood up and declared, \"This cannot be borne!\" These words were the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.\n\nThráin sent messengers to deliver the tale to all the corners of the world. Word was sent to all the Houses of the other Fathers. The kings of the other Houses answered to Thráin's call to vengeance, as they all saw this heinous deed committed by Azog to be a profound dishonor to the heir of the eldest of their race, and it raised their fury. While most of the war was fought in the mines and tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains, the bloody climatic battle took place beneath the East-Gate of Moria in the valley of Azanulbizar. Heavy losses were inflicted on both sides. Frerin, the younger brother of Thorin Oakenshield was among those that fell. Thráin himself had been wounded in the battle and suffered a grievous eye-wound. The tide of battle at last turned when fresh reinforcements from the Iron Hills arrived late. Realizing that his hordes were being annihilated and routed by the Dwarves, Azog turned and attempted to flee back to the gate but was slain by Dain Ironfoot, bringing about an end to the war.\n\nAfterward, Thráin led the remainder of his people, among them his eldest son Thorin Oakenshield, back to Dunland where they dwelt for a while. Eventually they relocated to the northern Blue Mountains where they made their dwelling among the ruins of Belegost. Thráin had also taken with him a map which showed a secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. After some time, they showed signs of prosperity and their numbers slowly began to increase.\n\nMany years later, Thráin grew older and he became restless. His desire to reclaim his kingdom of the Lonely Mountain grew. In TA 2841, he and a group of followers including Balin and Dwalin left their dwelling in the Blue Mountains and journeyed into Wilderland. They were pursued by the servants of Sauron and one morning, in the eaves of Mirkwood, his companions awoke to find that Thráin was missing. They searched in vain for him for days but he could not be found at all. It was later learned that he had been captured and imprisoned in the pits of Sauron's stronghold of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood. There he was tortured and Sauron took from him the last of the Dwarven Rings of Power, and left him there to die.\n\nBut before his death, while on a mission to Dol Guldur, Gandalf the Grey came upon Thráin, and was given the old map. Thráin appeared so diminished that he had forgotten almost everything as well as his own name. Gandalf promised to deliver it to Thráin's son, but Thráin at the time had forgotten his name so Gandalf had no way of knowing who he was and did not expect to be able to fulfill this promise. There Thráin died.\n\nYears later Gandalf met with Thorin near Bree, and realized who the Dwarf he had met in Dol Guldur had been. He promised to help Thorin in his quest to the Lonely Mountain in many ways, the most notable of which was by inviting a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins along to fulfill the role of burglar.\n\nSeveral decades later, during the Council of Elrond, Glóin admitted that part of Balin's reasons for attempting to re-enter Moria was to find the last dwarven Ring of Power, since it had last been seen in Thrór's possession when he died there. Gandalf regretfully said that Thrór had passed the ring to Thráin, and it had been taken from him in Dol Goldur. Glóin lamented this loss, wondering aloud when, if ever, the dwarves would have their revenge against Sauron.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Thr%C3%A1in_II"}}

The creature's blood is black.\n\nIn the Peter Jackson's 2001 movie version, there is one cave troll which is killed by the Fellowship members who spear and hack at the cave-troll to no avail until Legolas dispatches it with an arrow. The arrow enters the roof of its mouth and goes straight through the troll's brain, emerging from the back of its head after becoming stuck in the troll's thick skull; normally an arrow, even elven, wouldn't deal that much damage. In the movie, the cave troll is computer animated. Its movements were done by Randall William Cook, wearing a motion-capture suit. It also has a set of nostrils located higher than the space between its eyes, making its nose look almost like a \"third eye\".\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's animated movie, the cave troll has quite an inconsequential part. Gandalf says \"Orcs and something else! A great cave troll I think!\" when he sees the orcs through the east gate. Boromir then closes the gates but they are barged open by a large creature covered all in fur apart from its hands and feet (Presumably the cave-troll). After this, Frodo leaps towards the creature, stabbing it through the foot, shouting \"For the Shire!\" as he does so, causing it to flee.\n\nGames Workshop produced three cave trolls with different weapon options: one with a hammer and chain, one with a spear, and another with its hammer rising up.

He lived during the First Age of the Sun in Middle-earth, and was a lord of the hidden Elven kingdom of Gondolin. He became infamous for his betrayal of the location of the city of Gondolin to the Dark Lord Morgoth.","Morleg was the original and rejected name for him, as found in The War of the Jewels."],"name":"Maeglin","description":"Aredhel had left Gondolin to wander through Beleriand, and in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she met Eöl, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. Eöl gave his child the name Maeglin when he was twelve. His mother told him about Gondolin and its people throughout his childhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He and his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan Elmoth and Eöl's strict shunning of the outside world. When Aredhel finally decided to leave Eöl, she took her son (who stole his father's sword, Anguirel, forged of meteoric iron) with her and returned to Gondolin. However, Eöl had followed her, and in judgment before Turgon, he attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart, but hit Aredhel instead. She died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city walls.\n\nMaeglin was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin both learned and taught much. He became an elven-prince held in high esteem, even leading his own noble house. He found rich loads of metals in the Echoriath surrounding the city and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named Anghabar, \"Iron Mine\". In the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Maeglin refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon. The seventh and final gate of Gondolin, the Great Gate of Steel, was Maeglin's creation.\n\nEven though Maeglin was one of the mighty of Gondolin, his greatest desire was to take Turgon's daughter Idril to be his wife. But his desire was in vain, for Idril was his own first cousin, and as such was considered by Elven society to be too close in kinship with Maeglin to allow for any romantic relationship. Additionally, Idril was well aware of Maeglin's thought concerning her and despised him for it.\n\nWhen Tuor came, carrying Ulmo's warning of the danger to Gondolin, Maeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. The arguments made by Maeglin were instrumental in convincing Turgon not to leave Gondolin despite Ulmo's warnings, which ultimately resulted in the near-complete slaughter of the city's people. Seven years later, Tuor and Idril were wed and Idril bore a son, Eärendil, further increasing Maeglin's hate. Some time later, Maeglin was captured by orcs while seeking for metals outside of the Encircling Mountains. He was brought to Angband and taken before Morgoth himself, who knew that Maeglin dwelt in Gondolin and was eager to learn its location. He threatened Maeglin with unimaginable torment, and though Maeglin was no craven, he was cowed by Morgoth's threats and betrayed the location and weaknesses of Gondolin in exchange for his freedom. Morgoth was overjoyed to obtain this information, and to further encourage Maeglin and ensure both his silence and his further aid, Morgoth promised him both rule of the city and the hand of Idril once Turgon was overthrown. Maeglin assented eagerly to this bargain. Afterwards, Morgoth released him and he returned to Gondolin without suspicion. When the hosts of Morgoth attacked and overran the city, Maeglin sought to capture Idril and fought with Tuor on the walls. But Tuor prevailed, and threw him from the wall to his death.\n\nMaeglin was a relatively young elf, being merely 190 years old at the time of his death.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Maeglin"}}

They were very strong, but turned into stone in sunlight. Many trolls died in the War of Wrath, but some survived and joined the forces of Sauron, the greatest surviving servant of Morgoth. In the Second and Third Age, trolls were among Sauron's most dangerous warriors. He created the Olog-hai, which were smarter than earlier breeds of trolls. While most trolls cannot bear exposure to sunlight without turning to stone, the Olog-hai apparently could (to the same extent as orcs); this attribute was mentioned in The Return of the King as making them particularly dangerous.   During Bilbo's quest to the Lonely Mountain, trolls were known to speak with thick Cockney accents, specifically three hill trolls who dwelt in the Trollshaws and had gotten there from the Ettenmoors . They turned to stone when exposed to sunlight, for stone, as told in The Hobbit, is what trolls were originally made of. They enjoyed eating anything they could get their hands on. While threatening, the trolls in The Hobbit serve as a comic element. They even had normal names: Tom, Bert, and William (Bill) Huggins (the only one with a given surname).During the War of the Ring, Frodo and the Fellowship encountered cave trolls alongside various orcs within Moria. Boromir's sword recoiled off the scaled hide of one troll. As things seemed perilous, however, the trolls fled (although this was due to the approach of the far more threatening balrog, Durin's Bane). Sauron used Olog-hai in the Siege of Gondor and Battle of the Pelennor Fields. In the subsequent Battle at the Black Gate, the hobbit Peregrin Took killed a large Olog-hai troll with a huge sword. As a result of the One Ring being destroyed, the Black Gate collapsed into ruin during that battle. Most of the trolls present at the battle were killed, and the others are known to have fled.\n\nThey were strong and vicious, but generally dim-witted and stupid at best. Some were described as being able to speak, while others appear to be as irrational as animals. The major weakness of at least some trolls was that they turned to stone in sunlight. Their hide was as thick as stone and nigh-impervious to physical attacks. It is stated that they were created by Melkor, although it's not clear exactly how. The Ent Treebeard says that trolls were \"made in mockery\" of ents, as Orcs were of elves, though not necessarily from Entish stock. However, they could be based on another race of Middle-earth, as neither Morgoth nor Sauron has access to the Secret Fire, and therefore cannot create things, only alter that which already exists. There is reference that sunlight will return them to the stone they were made from in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. They seem to be fond of meat, and will eat almost any animal or being they come across. They also have very disgusting manners.\n\nDuring the wars of Beleriand, Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs, had a bodyguard of trolls. While leading his men in a final stand to protect the retreat of Turgon and the continued secrecy of the Kingdom of Gondolin, the great warrior Húrin faced them and, due to Morgoth's emphatic orders to have Húrin captured alive, he managed to kill many of them. Their apparently caustic blood, however, melted his axe, allowing Orcs to swarm over him and bind him, his capture ending the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where Morgoth triumphed over the united armies of Elves, Men, and Dwarves.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, there is a reference to \"men-like half-trolls\", also called troll-men, but it is unclear whether these men actually had some trollish ancestry or were simply compared to trolls (for some readers, the first interpretation is supported by the similar and interchangeable terms \"orc-men\" and \"half-orcs\", referring to crossbreeds of Saruman).\n\nThis section does not cite any references or sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unverifiable material may be challenged and removed. (October 2007)\n\nTrolls here are shown as large humanoids of apparently mammalian nature, with large noses and tusks (though Tom's have apparently been broken off in his mouth). Other than Tom, Bert, and William, several trolls in armor are seen in the Siege of Gondor in The Return of the King, as melee fighters and as operators of the battering ram Grond.\n\nRalph Bakshi's 1978 animated version follows the book very faithfully in its depiction of the encounter with the troll in the Chamber; however, the troll does have toes here. From the parts of it seen through the door it seems to be a humanoid reptilian around nine feet tall. Tolkien described the troll's foot as flat and toeless. There are no other trolls.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's 2001 The Fellowship of the Ring, there is also only one cave troll. Boromir first sights it; it later barges through the open doors, and smashes much of the Chamber, including Balin's tomb, in the ensuing fight. It stabs Frodo, who is saved by his Mithril shirt (in the book it is an Uruk captain who spears him). It is killed by the members of the Fellowship (though it puts up a good fight), who spear and hack at it until Legolas dispatches it with an arrow. It enters the soft palate of its mouth and goes straight through its brain, emerging from the top of its head after becoming stuck in the thick skull. It has been noted that, in Jackson's version, light from a window falls on Balin's tomb, which the troll steps into. This theoretically should have turned it to stone, although the light may be coming from the moon during early morning hours.\n\nBattle trolls were shown as the shock troops in the The Two Towers and the The Return of the King, sporting armor and spiked clubs alluded to in the appendices. They were then used in the Siege of Gondor, as primary shock troops after the gates of Minas Tirith were broken. At least one survived, which carried a hammer instead of a club, and is seen later, attempting to break down a gate.\n\nSauron's military used other trolls for moving extremely heavy objects such as gates and siege towers, sometimes chaining them. The cave troll in Moria wore a collar with a trailing chain, suggesting it may have been a former labourer, though this particular specimen was undisciplined enough to attack some of its own allies in the fight, thus perhaps showing others' need to restrain it.\n\nAragorn fights one of the Olog-hai during the battle of the Black Gate. This olog's entire upper body is covered in black plate armour, making it more menacing. While most trolls in the movies wielded clubs, this one wielded a sword, as well as a briefly-seen mace. It fled when the Ring was destroyed, and was last seen running past the ranks of Sauron's army before the ground collapsed beneath them. Earlier versions of this battle had Aragorn battling a reembodied Sauron, but this idea was abandoned in favor of the troll.\n\nVarious movie-only sources, like The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare, and the spin-off games by Electronic Arts, greatly expand on what Tolkien wrote about trolls.\n\nIn the world of the films, mountain trolls, including the cave trolls of Moria, are about 17 feet (5 m) tall, with massive limbs, potbellies, and dark scales on its back and shoulders. They come in stony colours, with the most common being grey. They have 22 teeth, including two fangs on the lower canines. As in the book, their blood is black, and is so hot that when split it sizzles on the floor. They are mainly carnivorous, but can digest plant matter if need be. The eyes are either grey or blue. They wear loincloths of leather that they find in the Mines or are given by the Orcs. They sometimes roar when in a battle rage, but are incapable of forming words or language. They often wield either a great club or a hammer. Cave-trolls are usually found with small groups of orcs. They are too unintelligent to hunt food for themselves, often consuming whatever hapless creature they come across, so food is an advantage they get from working with the Orcs. Their fingernails extend to most of their fingers, and were allegedly used to dig holes into the rock itself.\n\nThe Olog-hai differ from the other trolls depicted in the New Line movies in that they have more forward-facing eyes as well as hair on their bodies, suggesting that they are a more advanced form of troll. They are usually grey to black in colour. Mountain-trolls and Olog-hai have much in common: they are both much larger and more intelligent than most trolls are and more resistant to light. However, Olog-hai are certainly far superior to Mountain-trolls in all these aspects.\n\nForest troll were invented for the EA game version of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. They have hard grey skin, are resistant to arrow fire, and carry a large quiver of wood logs (to use as firewood and projectiles), as well as a mace like Cave-troll.\n\nFor the game version of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, trolls also returned as enemy units. Although they were slow, their attacks could not be blocked and were very strong; however, there was often a war pike around that made them easy to kill. They also appeared as enemies in \"Lord of the Rings: The Third Age\". In this game, they were again slow but powerful, and could take a lot of damage before dying. Some of the later trolls in the game (the Attack Troll) wielded a pair of large swords, while a stronger kind carried massive war hammers. Trolls also appear as controllable units in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, its sequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II and its expansion The Rise of the Witch-king. In The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, it is necessary for a regular mountain troll to gain a rank (after destroying enemy units, etc.), to become an attack troll where it gains an armour bonus and can heal by itself as the only non-hero unit who is able to do so. In The Battle for Middle-earth II, attack trolls can be made from a Rank 3 Troll Cage. In The Rise of the Witch-king, the Angmar faction has a troll hero named Rogash. Rogash was portrayed to be an apparently relatively intelligent hill-troll, seemingly serving as the Witch-King's key to power over the trolls. Rogash's authority over the trolls is displayed in his ability to convert other trolls on the battle field to the player's side. Rogash is a potent fighter, and wears a set of (by troll standards) finely crafted and imposing armor, and wields a hefty sword. Mountain-trolls and Cave Troll usually flail when dying in Battle for Middle-earth. (Note: when this happens do not fire; it just wastes time.) In all the Battle for Middle-earth games, trolls are depicted as \"tank\" units (slow, very strong, can take massive damage before being killed).\n\nWhile it is never explicitly mentioned in the books that armored battle trolls existed, it is highly likely that they did exist and that Sauron used them for deadly effect.\n\nThere is also a type of troll known as the drummer troll in the movies and games. This troll was not designed for battle, but rather it provided a steady beat, inspiring Mordor forces. It could also howl to drive opponents away in terror. In the \"Third Age\" PS2 game, these trolls have magic powers. In the games workshop game manual it says that if attacked it will drive away its enemies by hitting them with their drums, however this is not possible because they always run away from battle if they are losing.\n\nWood trolls in the MMO The Lord of the Rings Online are trolls that appear to be semi-entish and made of wood. They appear in the Trollshaws and Evendim, are particularly difficult to kill, and deal a lot of damage.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings tabletop wargame, produced by Games Workshop, includes an Isengard troll, which is depicted as wearing armour and carrying a shield similar to Uruk-hai.\n\nIn Norse mythology, trolls are magical creatures with special skills, and are so accepted to this day in Norway. In Tolkien's writings, they are portrayed as evil, with crude, bloodthirsty habits.\n\nIn The Battle for Middle-Eearth II, there are also Attack Trolls, drummer trolls, and half-trolls.\n\nOriginating in Norse mythology, an extremely widespread belief in its time, there are many types of trolls, each unique to its inhabitants:\n\nThe Olog-hai were actually a breed of mountain trolls. They seldom spoke and were said to know no language other than the Black Speech, in which Olog-hai means \"troll-folk\" (singular olog, \"troll\"). Because of their cunning, they were (incorrectly) believed by some to be giant orcs rather than trolls. They appeared towards the end of the Third Age and could be found near Dol Guldur and in the mountains around Mordor. In the Battle of the Black Gate, there appear \"Hill trolls\" of Gorgoroth, which are implied to be Olog-hai in one of the appendices to The Lord of the Rings (the term is not used within the story proper). These were described as being taller and wider than men and their hide or armour was described as a mesh of horny scales. They had black blood. Peregrin Took slew one of these trolls at the Battle of the Black Gate and, after the destruction of the One Ring and the fall of Sauron, the surviving trolls scattered as if mindless.\n\nTorog was the Elven (Sindarin) name for those of troll-kind. Tolkien normally renders it as \"troll\" in his works. The derivation of this word is uncertain - it may be derived from old Elvish words or perhaps imitates olog, which seems to be the comparative term in Black Speech.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Trolls"}}

He was enslaved and became a thrall of Angband for seventeen years (FA 472 -489).\n\nGwindor escaped Angband, but his hand was chopped off while fighting one of the orc guards. The injury devastated Gwindor and he fell into despair in the wilderness and nearly died of his wound. He was rescued by Beleg Strongbow and his will to live returned. He later helped Beleg free Túrin Turambar and, after Beleg's tragic and accidental death, Gwindor found himself trying to rouse Turin as Beleg had roused Gwindor. He brought him to Nargothrond. He counselled against Túrin's policy of open warfare upon Morgoth's forces, but was ignored. He loved the elf Finduilas, but found himself unfit to wed her and broke their engagement. He grew jealous of Turin since she loved him more and felt Turin had gained respect from the council at his expense. He warned Finduilas that Turin was cursed and would bring only doom to the people he loved. Nevertheless, he pitied Turin and loved him. He was mortally wounded in the Battle of Tumhalad, the last battle of Nargothrond. Túrin abandoned the battle and bore him to safety, but his wounds could not be healed. Gwindor died reproaching Túrin for his pride and pleading him to save Finduilas, who alone stood between Túrin and his doom.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gwindor"}}

It is in these mountains that they meet their next party member, Elegost. Elegost is an archer and is very useful, as he can heal and use devastating spirit and ranger attacks. With Elegost, they clear the area of wargs and head on their way. Elegost asks them to help him recover a map of Moria from the Mordor Orc who stole it from him during a fight on the pass of Caradhras. He also seeks aid in finding his old dwarf friend.

While traveling through Moria they confront many Orcs and Trolls. Later, they enter the room of Balin, Lord of Moria, who lies in his crushed tomb. The Balrog, Durin's Bane, eventually finds the company. Idrial realises that it is after the wizard, Gandalf. They confront the Balrog with Gandalf, not offering that much help, because they are not strong enough to defeat the Balrog. When they are done fighting, Gandalf falls with the Balrog, later killing it. They flee to The Great River in search of Boromir for Berethor's quest, only to discover that he is dead.

Idrial says that she could not always be around to protect them, so she had Aranel watch over them. They later find Gandalf The White, and offer to help him with his quest. The party soon finds Aranel's scouts spread around the area, one dead, but the rest alive. They need to defeat many attacking Uruks in the area and aid Aranel. When they are finished, the company travels to Rohan, Home of the Horse Lords. They need to gather riders to aid Eomer and Gandalf. While finding riders, a new member joins the party, Morwen.

Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, and Frodo's cracking.\"\n\nAfter Frodo and Sam left the Shire in September of 3018, Lotho Sackville-Baggins bought the Old Mill and tore it down. He replaced it with an ugly brick building that straddled the river and was full of wheels and strange contraptions to increase production. The next year in September of 3019, Saruman took over operation of the Mill and it was used for some industrial purpose that created noise and pollution.\n\nTed Sandyman was pleased by these developments and he continued to work in the New Mill.

They encountered Ted Sandyman at the New Mill. Ted laughed at their dismay at the destruction that had been done to Hobbiton, and he said that if they touched him he would report them to the Chief. When Merry told him that the Chief's Men had been defeated and that the Chief was about to be removed, Ted was shocked.

He was born in the refuge of the Havens of Sirion in Beleriand late in the First Age, soon before its sack by the Sons of Fëanor. Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and raised by Maedhros and Maglor, the Sons of Fëanor. Though at first there was no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and cherished them, and eventually grew to love them. By the end of the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of Fëanor were again working alone, suggesting that by this time Elrond and Elros had left their nominal captivity and traveled to Lindon.","Near the end of the Second Age, Elrond rode beside Gil-Galad in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, which set out from Rivendell to Mordor in SA 3431. Elrond was Gil-galad's herald during the war against Sauron. The Alliance, which also included elves from Lorien, men from Arnor and Gondor, and Dwarves led by Durin lV, eventually defeated Sauron's army and laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years. Eventually, Sauron himself was defeated by Elendil and Gil-galad, allowing Isildur to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claim the Ring for himself.","Elrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, after which he went to Minas Tirith to surrender the Sceptre of Annúminas to King Elessar and give his daughter Arwen Undómiel away to be married.

Realizing that Arwen's love for Aragorn cannot be overcome, Elrond agrees to reforge Narsil, the sword of Elendil, into Andúril. Later, Elrond delivers Andúril to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and urges him to reclaim the throne of Gondor and take command of the Army of the Dead. Elrond does not appear again until the film's epilogue, where he presents Arwen to Aragorn at the latter's coronation.

Thorin is reluctant, but in his desperation he hands Elrond the map. Elrond realises that the writing is written in moon runes.

The latter may be more probable in that Elrond managed to cure a Morgul wound, something which is almost invariably fatal due to its association with dark sorcery. While it is unknown just how powerful Elrond is compared to other Elf Lords, he certainly holds vast potential, being descended from the angelic Maia Melian and being the wielder of the ring of power Vilya. A notable demonstration includes Elrond summoning a great flood on the River Bruinen to sweep away the Nazgûl. Elrond was also familiar with ósanwe, the skill of entering others' minds. After the destruction of the One Ring Elrond communicated mentally with Galadriel and Gandalf on their return journey from Minas Tirith.\n\nElrond was one of the most incorruptible of leaders of Middle-earth.

Bilbo was telling a story to a group of children about the trolls that were going to eat them before turning to stone in the sunlight.\n\nStone trolls tend to be dumb and ill-tempered. Almost all stone-trolls have first names, and a few (like William Huggins) had last names. Stone trolls eat things such as wild fowl, wild pigs\/boars, dwarves, hobbits, and fish (if they could actually catch them). They hunted simply by chasing or ambushing the animals, then hitting them with a weapon such as an axe or a club.\n\nStone-trolls commonly lived in caves or large burrows that went many yards underground, where they could shelter themselves from sunlight during the day. They slept on beds made of grasses and leaves or animal hides.\n\nStone-trolls participated in the War of Wrath, but they are not known to fight in any other wars. In the War of Wrath, they were used as beasts of burden and as shock troops, using giant axes and clubs to frighten their foes.\n\nIt is hard to say what the term \"stone-troll\" actually means because generally almost all trolls turn to stone when hit by sunlight. One possible meaning (as used in the book version of Fellowship of the Ring) is \"any troll that has been turned to stone by the sun\". Another possible meaning is that it is intended as an antonym for Olog-hai, since they do not ever turn to stone.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Stone-trolls"}}

The first was Cardolan, which bordered along the Barrow-downs. Rhudaur was the second realm, which lay just below Angmar. Finally, Arthedain was the greatest realm which held the great kingdom of the Dúnedain, also its capitol city Fornost.\n\nThe Witch-King and the Men of Carn Dûm intended to conquer the three realms by destroying every single Dúnedain man and their cities. Rhudaur was the first to fall, and Cardolan was the second. Finally, the Men of Carn Dûm attacked the realm of Arthedain and its capitol city of Fornost. The Witch-King succeeded in destroying the great city, and the Men of Carn Dûm ruled with an iron fist of wrath\n\nThe surviving Men of Arnor formed an alliance with the elves that destroyed the Men of Carn Dûm and their kingdom of Angmar. Since then, the Witch-king has abandoned his realm, and retreated south to dwell in his new stronghold Minas Morgul.\n\nDespite their supposed destruction, in the video game The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, the Men of Carn Dûm were not all destroyed. Those who survived returned to fight for Sauron under his deadliest servant Agandaur during the War of the Ring. They are first seen standing on either side of Agandaur at Sarn Ford after the Nazgûl have pillaged it.\n\nThey are seen more often after Agandaur meets and tries to convince the dragon, Urgost of the Grey Mountains to serve him. Agandaur leaves the Men of Carn Dûm behind at the dragon's lair to stand watch and await the dragon's answer. They soon take part in Agandaur's attack on Nordinbad, in which they fail due to Eradan, Farin, and Andriel intervening.\n\nAfter their failed attack on Nordinbad, they battle the trio who have come to destroy Agandaur at their ironclad Fortress of Carn Dûm itself. When Agandaur is destroyed at the same time as Sauron's destruction, the Men of Carn Dûm are scattered. Those who still lived may have fled the stronghold, or were picked off by the dragon Urgost who - sensing Sauron's destruction - claimed it for himself.\n\nThe Men of Carn Dûm have the appearance of a barbarian. Their beards are long and bushy, they're very muscular, and have very savage fighting styles. Their helmets have horns on them; they wear wooly armor, and wield large weaponry such as hammers, maces or axes.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Men_of_Carn_D%C3%BBm"}}

He went into exile with his master during the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed with his master in Himlad and later fled with him to Nargothrond after their defeat in the Dagor Bragollach.\n\nHe became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril. When Beren had left Lúthien and gone with Finrod Felagund to Angband but had been captured in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Lúthien set out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Nargothrond at the time and were hunting. Huan smelt Lúthien and captured her, and she was brought before Celegorm. Celegorm and Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death by the hand of Sauron, and took her as a prisoner to Nargothrond, \"for her own protection\", secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and thereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father Thingol.\n\nHuan felt pity for Lúthien, and sought her out. Speaking for the first time, he told her of a way to escape, using a secret exit, and then accompanied her to Tol-in-Gaurhoth where, with the help of Lúthien's magic, he killed all of Sauron's werewolves until Sauron himself came out, knowing of the prophesy about Huan's death he took the shape of the greatest wolf that had ever lived up to that point. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat him, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while Lúthien and Beren went on their way back to Doriath, they came across Celegorm and Curufin once more, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by Orodreth when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien, but Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Lúthien.\n\nSpeaking for the second time, Huan told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to gain entrance to Angband, bringing them the skin of the werewolf Draugluin and the bat-skin of Sauron's messenger Thuringwethil. Using these skins as disguise Beren and Lúthien went to Angband, while Huan hunted in the wild.\n\nAfter Beren and Lúthien had won the Silmaril but Beren had lost his hand to the werewolf Carcharoth, Huan joined Beren, Thingol, Beleg Cúthalion and Mablung in the Hunt for the Wolf. Huan and Beren managed to kill Carcharoth, but Huan was mortally wounded.

A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple Hobbit of plain speech. However, his love for Elves, his gift for poetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most hobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins) set him apart from the beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in Tolkien's novels) the theme of the Elves sailing from Middle-earth, a subtle foreshadowing of Bilbo and Frodo's final journey across the sea from the Grey Havens. He lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known as \"The Gaffer\", on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. Sam's mother was Bell Goodchild. He had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold.\n\nAs \"punishment\" for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo regarding the dangers of the One Ring, Gandalf chose Sam be Frodo's companion on his journey to Rivendell. Sam saved Frodo's life more than once during the quest to destroy the Ring, and accompanied him all the way to Mount Doom.\n\nAfter Shelob attacked and seemingly killed Frodo, Sam took the Ring, intending to complete the quest on his own. Because he held the Ring for a time, he was considered one of the Ring-bearers and during the time he possessed it the Ring tempted him with visions of a great garden all for himself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and temptations of the Ring, and returned it when he discovered Frodo alive in the Tower of Cirith Ungol. He and Bilbo were the only ones ever to have given up the ring willingly, and only Sam surrendered it readily.\n\nWhen Orcs took Frodo's body, Sam overheard one of them saying that Frodo was still alive, so he followed the Orcs into the Tower of Cirith Ungol, determined to rescue Frodo. Once there he found that competing bands of Uruks and Morgul Orcs had rioted and killed one another over the possession of Frodo's Mithril coat, thus making it easier for Sam to get to Frodo and escape the tower with him.\n\nSam and Frodo made their way to Mount Doom, disguised as Orcs along the way. The way to Mount Doom was filled with fiery rocks and pillows of ash which made it almost impossible for the hobbits to pass. When Frodo collapsed from weakness, Sam carried him up the slopes of Mount Doom, only to be stopped by Gollum. Sam delayed Gollum while Frodo walked on to the volcano. As Sam, following Frodo, reached and entered the door of the Sammath Naur he didn't notice Gollum following behind. Sam yelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its power and claimed the Ring for himself, putting it on his finger and disappearing from Sam's sight. Just then Gollum attacked Sam, who fell and hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put on the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was reunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he toppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying the One Ring, and him dying in the process with it.\n\nThe two hobbits managed to escape the crumbling mountain, just as the volcano erupted, only to be left helpless atop the remains of giant rock,engulfed in a sea of lava . As their demise approached, Sam confessed his love for the beautiful hobbit, Rosie, a fellow resident of Hobbiton, that he dreamed of one day marrying. Sam and Frodo eventually collapsed from exhaustion, but were spotted by Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles and with his Eagle companions. Landroval and Meneldor rescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to the safety of Minas Tirith.\n\nAfter recovering from their strenuous and substantial injuries Frodo and Sam were greeted by the rest of The Fellowship, who praised the two Halfling's for completing their mission. Sam and the rest of the hobbits, remained in Gondor to bear witness to Aragorn's Coronation Ceremony. Many of Middle Earth's esteemed leaders and famed warriors were in attendance as the new King of Gondor was crowned. Aragorn, greeted many of the brave souls who had helped the Fellowship on their journey's, but non more so than the four brave hobbits who stood before him. Aragorn and the rest of the city, bowed to the four halfling's, in admiration for thier brave acts that ensured the safety of all of Middle Earth\n\nWith the threat of Sauron's return vanquished and The One Ring destroyed, the four hobbits returned to the Shire, where they settled in once again.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and the end of the Third Age, Sam married Rose (Rosie) Cotton. They had thirteen children: Elanor the Fair, Frodo, Rose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks, Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby, Robin, and Tolman. When Frodo Baggins announced that he was leaving to the Undying Lands, west of Middle-earth, he gave Sam the Red Book of Westmarch and the household of Bag End where he and his large personal family later called the Gardners would live for many years. After Will Whitfoot resigned his post as Mayor of Michel Delving, in SR 1427, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive 7-year terms.\n\nAfter his wife died in the year 61 of the Fourth Age (SR 1482), Sam entrusted the Red Book to his daughter, Elanor and left the Shire. It is a tradition handed down from Elanor that he went to the Grey Havens, and because he was also a Ring-bearer (albeit for a short time), he was allowed to pass over the Sea to be reunited with Frodo in the Undying Lands.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Samwise_Gamgee"}}

Húrin was the elder son of Galdor of the House of Marach and Hareth of the Haladin, and he had a younger brother Huor. He was known to be of unimpressive stature, so much so that he could not wear the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin because it was too large on him to fit properly. Despite this, his prowess in combat surpassed that of all his peers.\n\nIn the year FA 458, Huor and Húrin dwelt with their kin in the forest of Brethil, when they joined a war party against Orcs. The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by orcs, the Vala Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Dimbar, there two Great Eagles picked them up, and brought them to Gondolin. King Turgon of Gondolin welcomed the brothers, remembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aid Gondolin in their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The brothers swore an oath to keep Gondolin secret, and Eagles brought them back to Dor-Lómin.\n\nIn FA 462 Morgoth assailed Hithlum and Húrin's father Galdor the Tall fell defending the Ered Wethrin. Húrin chased the Orcs away with heavy losses over the plains of Anfauglith. Afterwards, Húrin was the Lord of Dor-lómin and ruled over the Hadorian fief of Dor-lómin in Hithlum.\n\nTwo years later, he wedded Morwen Elf-Sheen of the House of Bëor, and later in the year was born their son Túrin. A daughter Lalaith followed, but she died aged three years old by a plague sent from Angband.\n\nIn FA 473, in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin fought alongside Huor and the Sons of Hador. In the midst of battle, he met again with Turgon, and their meeting was sweet. When the battle was lost, Húrin and Huor gathered all the remaining men of the House of Hador and they took a stand fighting off the Orcs, allowing Turgon to escape. Step by step, the army of Morgoth pushed them back. They stepped back until the river Rivil was in front of them, there they did not take one-step back. They kept on fighting until dusk when Huor was slain. In the end, Húrin stood there alone, there he threw his sword and shield on the ground and he took a grand battle-axe of an Orc captain. He waded alone into Gothmog's bodyguard of Trolls, and with every one he slew he yelled with all his voice: \"Aure entuluva!\" (\"Day will come again!\") This battle cry was heard seventy times. Húrin fought with the battle axe until the axe itself withered away from the caustic blood of the trolls he had been slaying. He was grappled by the orcs and taken hostage, even though he hewed their limbs off as they grabbed him. Húrin was brought captive to Morgoth, and despite horrific torture, he refused to reveal the location of Gondolin. Due to his defiance, Morgoth cursed him and his family to misery and hopelessness.\n\nHúrin was placed high on the peaks of Thangorodrim, either chained or magically immobilised in a seat where, through the power of Morgoth, he could see all the evils that later befell his son Túrin. He never saw his second daughter Nienor, who was born while he was a captive.\n\nIn the year FA 500, after the death of his children, Morgoth released Húrin, feigning pity to an utterly defeated foe. In reality however, Morgoth hoped that the bitterness and hate that had been wrought in Húrin throughout his years of watching his family suffer would cause strife and misfortune to those whom Húrin encountered. He was brought to his old homelands in Hithlum, but the Easterlings now living there at first did not recognize him and later feared him, believing him to be high in Morgoth's favor. The House of Hador had been destroyed or enslaved. Seven outlaws joined Húrin, and together they went to the vale of Sirion, where he once had known Gondolin. Húrin abandoned the outlaws and sought for the entrance, but Gondolin was closed, and Turgon at first did not wish to allow Húrin in. Húrin cried out against Turgon, thus inadvertently revealing the general location of Gondolin to Morgoth's spies, and then left. Only after he had left did Turgon have a change of heart and send Eagles to fetch him, but they came too late and did not find him.\n\nHúrin continued to the forest of Brethil where his son and daughter had died, and met his wife Morwen there at their grave, just before she, too, died. In anger and despair, he sought out the Haladin, blaming them for the death of his wife and children, and after being put on trial caused a revolt in which Hardang, of the house of Haldad, was slain . Húrin met up again with the outlaws, and together with a few of the Haladin, they went to Nargothrond, where Húrin killed the Petty-dwarf Mîm who had claimed the treasure of Glaurung, earning a curse on the gold. Húrin and his outlaws brought the treasure to Doriath, insulting Thingol by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of Húrin's kin. The outlaws did not accept this, and a bitter battle was fought at Menegroth, leading to the death of all of them, and further cursing the gold. Húrin thus brought a curse on Doriath as well, eventually leading to its downfall.\n\nMelian's kind words managed to break through to Húrin's clouded mind, and Húrin finally saw that all his deeds had only aided Morgoth. A broken man, he finally cast himself in the sea and ended his life.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/H%C3%BArin"}}

Easterlings were enemies of the Free Peoples and were allies of Sauron. There were many different nations and kingdoms of Easterlings living in the vast lands of Rhûn. These ranged from civilized empires to barbaric horse nomads of the open steppes."],"name":"Easterlings","description":"Easterlings were either tall and sallow-skinned or short and swarthy. However, there were also said to be a different type of Easterlings that appeared during the Siege of Gondor from unknown eastern lands, who were broad, short, and bearded, being perhaps Dwarves from one of four Dwarf clans of the Orocarni in the Far East. Easterlings were the most numerous and deadly of the enemies of the Free Peoples, and it is said if the Blue Wizards had not been sent into Rhûn the hosts of the East would have outnumbered the Western peoples. Their skin was either sallow (a pale yellow) or olive. Their eyes were dark (dark brown and black), and their straight hair was black. The \"swarthier\" Easterlings of the First Age and thed, and Fourth Ages may have not been a related people, as those of the First may have simply come from the then-unknown lands east of the Blue Mountains, and could have had more relation to the Dunlendings than the later Balchoth and Wainriders.\n\nDuring the First Age, the term was applied to the sons of Bór and Ulfang, or the Swarthy Men, who came into Beleriand much later than the Edain, and who were for a part secretly in league with Morgoth. By some men of Dor-lómin that appear in the Wanderings of Hurin, they are called Eastrons.\n\nBór was a leader of Men who came into Lothlann, in Beleriand, during the FA 463. His sons were Borlach, Borlad, and Borthand. Bór was welcomed by Maedhros, who gave him and his followers land north and south of the March of Maedhros. Bór and his sons swore allegiance to Maedhros, and remained faithful, though he was told by Morgoth to betray the banner of Caranthir. All of them were wiped out during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nUlfang also came in Lothlann, Beleriand, in 463, shortly after Bór. He was the father of Ulfast, Ulwarth, and Uldor \"the Accursed\". Ulfang was welcomed by the sons of Fëanor, and he and his sons swore allegiance to Caranthir. They were given lands to dwell in the north and south of the March of Maedhros. Ulfang and his sons were secretly in the employ of Morgoth, and betrayed the Eldar and Edain during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in what is now known as the Treachery of Men.\n\nAfter Nirnaeth Arnoediad at the bidding of Morgoth, the Easterlings invaded Hithlum. They spread throughout the wide lands plundering, destroying, and killing its inhabitants. The Eldar of Hithlum were able to escape from the invaders by taking refuge in the southern mountains that later the Easterlings avoided out of fear of the Elves. The Easterlings soon withdrew northwards and apparently settled.\n\nHowever, the Easterlings were betrayed by their lord Morgoth, and locked solely in Hithlum and denied the rich lands of the Beleriand that they so desired. Here the Easterlings governed with cruelty, robbing, stealing, and enslaving the remaining Men of Hithlum, who called the Easterlings the \" Incomers\". They took away the young and the able bodied and sometimes young women to be wives; the most widely known being Aerin of whom Brodda took to produce his heir. Despite these evil deeds, they did not take Morwen nor her house from her for they feared her and believed her to be a witch and so her son had time to escape to Doriath. Tuor, the cousin of Túrin was also enslaved in Hithlum by the Easterlings but he was able to escape and evaded them by living as an outlaw, until he was contacted by the Vala Ulmo and went to Gondolin.\n\nThe Easterlings ruled effectively in Hithlum as vassals of Morgoth from FA 473 to FA 583. After the War of Wrath, those that survived fled back over the Blue Mountains to Eriador and beyond were they sat themselves up as kings and chieftains of many of the Middle Men.\n\nA King of the Easterlings, Khamûl, was given one of the Rings of Power and became a powerful sorcerer, until the power of the Ring corrupted him. Around SA 2251, Khamûl became a Wraith and one of Sauron's servants.\n\nDuring the Third Age, the term was applied to the various nations and tribes of Men living in the uncharted lands east of the Sea of Rhûn and Mordor who were usually allied with Sauron (for one of their leaders was the second greatest of the Nazgûl, Khamûl) and frequently attacked Gondor and the lands bordering Rhûn. However, Sauron's defeat at the end of the War of the Last Alliance diminished his presence for over one thousand years, and any territorial ambition was left to them alone. In TA 490 they invaded Gondor, passing through Dagorlad and starting a series of wars that lasted sixty years until they were finally defeated in TA 550 by Turambar, the ninth King of Gondor. Afterwards, Gondor subdued some of them and took from them a large area of land between the Kingdom of Rhovanion and Mordor including the Sea of Rhûn.\n\nGondor held on to these territories for a few hundred years but slowly began to lose them over time, and the Easterlings once again initiated warfare. In TA 1248 they once again clashed with Gondor in a series of skirmishes but were still not powerful or organized enough to stand against Gondor\u2019s power. Though defeated the Easterlings would not have to wait long, for Gondor soon fell into decline and civil war. Afterwards, the Easterling tribes remained peaceful for the most part until the mid-nineteenth century when they were again powerful enough to attack the west.\n\nThe Wainriders were a confederation of Easterling and Haradrim tribes who were united by their hate of Gondor, fueled by the Dark Lord Sauron. Following the Great Plague which weakened Gondor, they started their attacks in TA 1856, defeating a Gondor army at the Battle of the Plains and killing King Narmacil II. They rode in great chariots (which gave them their name), and raided the lands of Rhovanion, destroying or enslaving its people. Gondor gradually lost all of its possessions east of Anduin to them.\n\nIn TA 1899, the thirtieth King of Gondor, Calimehtar son of Narmacil, defeated the Wainriders at Dagorlad, buying some rest for his land. However the Wainriders struck back in TA 1944, allying themselves with the Haradrim of Near Harad and the Variags of Khand. Before this they had been expanding their power southward, beyond Mordor, and had come into conflict with the tribes of Khand and the eastern Haradrim. But eventually these men allied under their universal hate of the West. They managed to kill King Ondoher and all his heirs, but instead of riding on to Minas Anor and taking the city, they paused to celebrate.\n\nMeanwhile, general Eärnil of Gondor's southern army rode north to defend his king defeating an inferior force of Haradrim in South Ithilien, he came too late to rescue Ondoher, but he did manage to annihilate the Wainriders for good at the Battle of the Camp. Eärnil was crowned king. After this defeat the might of the Wainriders was broken, and they retreated east. They still held Rhovanion, but never troubled Gondor again until the War of the Ring.\n\nThe Balchoth were a fierce race of Easterlings, who attacked Gondor while under orders of Dol Guldur. In TA 2510, they overran the plains of Calenardhon and almost destroyed the army of the Ruling Steward Cirion, but were defeated by the Éothéod under Eorl the Young. Like the Wainriders they rode in chariots and wagons, and they may have been descendants of these people. However, they were notably far more primitive and savage than the advanced Wainriders, so their origin is at most obscure.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age, the Easterlings joined with the forces of Mordor participating in the Northern battles that nearly defeated the Elves of Mirkwood, the Men of Dale, and the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain.\n\nDespite being on the losing side in the War of the Ring, some Easterlings still continued to remain a threat throughout the early Fourth Age but were finally subdued in a series of campaigns led by King Elessar. With some of their lands annexed to the Reunited Kingdom, it is presumed that there were no more major invasions to threaten the peace. It is not known whether these men mixed with their former enemies and learned to live in peace or initiated more wars thereafter. During these battles the Easterlings, aside from the hordes of Orcs, were the most numerous and tenacious of Sauron's warriors.\n\nThe Variags (Possibly related to the real world Varangians) were from Khand, and they first appeared in the West in 1856 and then in 1944 of the Third Age, fighting alongside the Wainriders. They later appeared during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Tolkien wrote little to nothing about the Variags and Khand; what information we have about them is speculative. It can be gleaned that the Variags were a horse riding people, as they supplied Mordor with horses and brought a large cavalry force to support the Wainriders. It is also possible that, like their real-world namesakes, they wielded large axes and were used as shock troops.\n\nNot much is known about the weapons used by the Easterlings. They had as far as it is known spears, bows, axes and chariots. They also seemed to favor the horse on many occasions, although all this probably differed greatly among the Easterling tribes, kingdoms, or empires.\n\nKnowledge of the culture of the Easterlings is limited. In the First Age they could be quite savage; examples of this rise from Brodda's treatment of the Men of the House of Hador in Dor-lómin. In the Third age at least, the Easterlings fought with great valor, as displayed during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and the Battle of the Black Gate. Even the women fought with the men to defend their homes and children. Easterlings fought with great skill and used many types of psychological warfare.\n\nIn the movie The Two Towers, an army from Rhûn is entering the Black Gate. The corresponding passage in the book describes them as Easterlings; in the movie they are the same, quite distinct from the Haradrim passing through Ithilien later in the film.\n\nHowever, as they carry the banner of Harad, many movie-watchers have been confused between the Haradrim and Easterlings. During this encounter, Sam accidentally falls down a slope where the Easterlings are passing by. Frodo goes after him, and two of the Easterling warriors notice the commotion; they leave the formation to inspect. Frodo hides himself and Sam under his elvish cloak, disguising them as a boulder. The Easterling soldiers almost find them, but eventually return to their legion and march into Mordor.\n\nIn the Return of the King they are also seen briefly after the gate of Minas Tirith has been breached. There they advance upon the soldiers of Gondor, but they are not seen fighting.\n\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies depicts one of the Nazgûl in armor resembling that of the Easterlings; this is undoubtedly intended to be Khamûl.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's film series, the Easterlings are depicted as a heavily-stylized, vaguely middle eastern culture. This caused some controversy after the films were released. In the appendices of the 'Special Extended Edition', the artists claim that they were inspired by a variety of Persian cultures, particularly Sassanid Persians, Mongol Horsemen and Ottoman Turks. They have \"crests\" on the backs of their hat-like helmets that resemble feudal Samurai crests. They also bear a rising sun emblem upon their armor. The full-body armor the Easterlings wear resembles armor which ancient Chinese soldiers wore. Beneath their armor they wear veils, headscarves, and robes. In some movie-models, their boots have upturned toes, suggesting a Mongolic or Persian influence.\n\nThe armor of the Easterlings entering the Black Gates was made from bronze, along with the helmet; its dragon-skull-shape was made to intimidate enemies.\n\n(Note the easterlings entering the black gate were not from any of the known or canon easterling factions and are most commonly known as the Golden Khaganate, an empire of easterlings that is not canon)\n\nTheir gold or brass overlayed steel lamellar armor consisted of a placard (stomach plate), gorget (heart & neck coverage), groin-plate, rerebraces (upper arm), vambraces (forearm), cuisses (thighs), and poleyns (knees). The clothing that the Men of Rhûn wore consisted of red leather gloves, black leather tall boots, burgundy long pants, a burgundy tunic with long sleeves, a burgundy headscarf, and a black facecloth . The undercut, brass helmet was worn over the headscarf, and featured cheek-and-eye guards, along with two horns from the back and a crest on the front, to remind other beings of dragons, intimidating to the enemy even before the battle began. This primitive form of psychological warfare was terrifyingly effective against the Men of Gondor and Rohan and Dale, who would oftentimes literally quake in their boots at what seemed a golden horde of Easterlings swarming from the farthest East.\n\nDuring battle, these heavy infantrymen formed the core of Sauron's armies, for they were taller, stronger, better-trained, and better-equipped than the swarming Orcs that fully comprised his forces.\n\nThe Men of Rhûn wore their clan-wealth as well: gold, copper, silver, rubies, and other colorful pieces of ornament-material. Easterlings also liked wearing battle trophies, talismans of victory that could inspire them to glory and riches and power and territory\/region ownership and totems of fear that would intimidate their next opponents. This psychological warfare struck terror into their enemies and gave them an even greater advantage in battle.\n\nWe are also told within the various writings of Tolkien's legendarium that they were extremely tenacious fighters. After the great rout during the later stages of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, a relatively small (7000 strong) force of Easterlings stood their ground, with their backs to the River Anduin, and fought to the last man while the host of Mordor fled. They caused sizeable and disproportionate casualties among the Men of the West, and reminded them once again that the Easterlings were dangerous and formidable opponents.\n\nThe curved, rectangular, two-foot by three-foot Easterling shield had concave top and bottom edges and was made with brass that surrounded a dark-brown square. It was held by an iron handgrip that was behind a brass circular boss surrounded by a diamond shape that was itself enveloped by the square. It came with a dark-red leather \"belt\" if the Man of Rhûn was to strap the shield to the forearm for combat requiring two hands. Even archery was allowed by this big strap. One rather striking detail on Rhûnic armor was that a sun was etched into their sternum-plate, resembling a burning of a grassland like Rohan or Dale.\n\nThe Easterlings had three principal weapons: their pike, the scimitar, and the composite bow.\n\nThe steel-bladed wooden halberd came in two sizes: the nine-foot halberd was used for porcupine formations and phalanx marches, while the five-foot one was used as a basic soldier's weapon. All halberds were spiked on the top (on the five-foot one it had a pike on the bottom too) and had downward-curving, serrated axe-blades, and below that halberds were backed by a curved spike; on the nine-foot one it was used to trip enemy horses while on the five-foot one it was used for piercing armor and deflecting if not disarming enemy blades. The axe blade featured a hole creating the curve. This was a truly versatile weapon that could be used both offensively and defensively.\n\nThe three-foot-bladed steel scimitar was carried by all troops as a secondary weapon (except in the case of Swordsmen). The curved blade was used in a downward, diagonal slashing attack and for thrusting. No matter which method of attack the Easterling chose to use with his scimitar, it was extremely effective in his hands. The scimitars were particularly suited for mounted attacks, as they were long and curved, allowing the rider to swing and hit his foes.\n\nThe Composite Bow of the Easterlings was made of multiple layers of wood and was of a recurve type. They were 4 feet long at the very most, and they were carried in holsters. The arrows had hawk feathers, and the tips were forged out of steel. Easterling cavalry archers were uniquely skilled, and while riding kept their quivers slung at their sides. They learned to stand up in the saddle and release their arrows at the moment the horse's hooves were off the ground, allowing them to shoot more accurately than Rohan's horse archers. They also have three-foot-wide rectangular shields in the movie.\n\nThe Easterlings were known for their unique type of cavalry known as kataphrakts. These were Easterlings that mounted upon heavily armored horses and wielded a scimitar and broad shield. They were notorious for their ferocity of their attacks and the sheer amount of defensive power that these troops could summon when they were deployed side-by-side. The brass lamellar armor on the fronts of their horses allowed them to safely trample spearmen and pikemen. Rhunic composite shortbows were sometimes taken instead of shields. The name Kataphrakts is possibly based on the Savaran Cataphracts, which were also heavily armored cavalry troops of the Sassanid Persian Empire. They could also be based off of Mongol archers and Ottoman Sipahis, as the way the horse is armored and how the warrior on its back fights are highly suggestive of this. They were featured in the The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Easterlings"}}

Mîm was captured, and arrows were shot at his sons Ibun and Khîm.\n\nIn exchange for his life, Mîm was forced to lead the outlaws to his secret halls in Amon Rûdh. There, it turned out Khîm had been killed by an arrow loosed by Androg, who was then forced to break his bow and arrows, and Túrin repenting offered his service to Mîm. For this reason Mîm tolerated the outlaws, and at the least came to respect Túrin (and was even jealous of Túrin's love for Beleg).\n\nWhen Beleg Cúthalion arrived at Amon Rûdh, Mîm was angry: he hated Elves, especially the Sindar.

With his dying words Mîm cursed the treasure. Húrin's band brought the treasure of Nargothrond (but not before most had killed each other along the way brought down by the treasures curse), and Thingol had to send his own men to bring the treasure to Doriath, where eventually the gold was a reason for the Sack of Doriath and the death of Thingol.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/M%C3%AEm"}}

The name Gollum was derived from the sound of his disgusting gurgling, choking cough. His birth can be estimated to have happened in the year TA 2430. His death date is given as March 25, 3019. His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring. At the time of his death, Sméagol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a creature that was once a Hobbit, but he had been deformed and twisted in both body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was to possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains in the book The Hobbit. In the movies, he was a deuteragonist-turned-secondary antagonist.","Once a predecessor of the Stoorish Hobbits, Sméagol spent the early years of his life living with his extended family under a Matriarch, his grandmother. Around the year TA 2463, Sméagol became the fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron, Isildur, and Déagol. Déagol was his cousin, and on Sméagol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that Déagol found a gold ring, after being pulled into the water by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sméagol fell to the power of the ring and demanded it as a birthday present. When Deágol refused, Sméagol promptly flew into a barbaric rage and fought with Deagol over the ring, choking him to death and taking the ring as his own. Sméagol was quickly corrupted further by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470. The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits. He called it his \"Precious\" or his \"Birthday Present,\" the latter as a justification for killing Déagol.","He lived in the Misty Mountains for over four hundred years, living on raw blind fish (which he caught from his small row boat), bats and Goblins when he could get them. Indeed, he made a song about raw fish, that he uses as a riddle to Bilbo and much later sings to Frodo in a longer version. In later years, he found Hobbit and Elven food repulsive.","Gollum eventually left the Mountains and pursued Bilbo a few years later, but the trail was cold. He made his way south into Mordor where all evil was being drawn at the time, discovering the secret stair located near Minas Morgul and surviving an encounter with Shelob. He was captured on his return, taken to the dungeons of Barad-dur and forced to reveal to Sauron under intense torture what he knew about the Ring. Gollum was then strangely freed, as he shows no particular loyalty towards Sauron, but caught by Aragorn, then interrogated by Gandalf, who placed him in the care of the Silvan Elves living in Thranduil's kingdom in Mirkwood. Assisted by Orcs he escaped them, and set off looking for the Shire. He passed through Moria, but could not make it out of the East gate. Seemingly he then just waited there until he got lucky when the Fellowship passed through. However, as Frodo was a ring-bearer he might have foreseen the passing of the ring. Alternatively, some of Saruman's or Sauron's spies may have revealed to him the Fellowship was heading towards Moria.","When the Black Gate was reached and found to be well guarded, Gollum convinced them not to go that way, saying that they would be caught and Sauron would regain the Ring. Gollum said he would lead them south, where he knew of another entrance into Mordor, in which Frodo complied, despite Sam's suspicions.","Here Bilbo's long-ago kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded, for Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, lost his balance and fell in, (In the movie Frodo assaults Gollum, and he trips) taking the Ring and finger with him along with a final cry of \"Precious!\". The ring was burned in the molten lava with Gollum consumed with it as well. Had Gollum not lived to play this final part, there was a good chance that Sauron would have regained his Ring, as he knew where Frodo was as soon as he put it on.","Gollum was also remembered for being the Ring-bearer that kept the Ring for about five hundred years, the second longest bearer besides Sauron himself, who bore it from SA 1600 to his defeat in SA 3441. He is also remarkable for having seen Sauron in person (when being tortured by him) and for managing to form an alliance with Shelob. As a traveller, explorer and Ranger he is perhaps the equal of Aragorn and Gandalf, easily travelling alone through extremely hostile terrains, and seemingly having travelled very widely. For instance, he found his own way through the Dead Marshes as well as discovering for himself the secret pass of Cirith Ungol. Also he manages to find his way through Moria from the East entrance to the West gate, something which even Gandalf did only with some difficulty.","In the first edition of The Hobbit, Gollum did not appear quite as wretched or as bound to the Ring. Tolkien revised this characterization to fit the concept of the Ruling Ring developed during the writing of The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien then explained the version given in the first edition as a lie that Bilbo made up to tell the Dwarves and Gandalf.","Sméagol's \"real\" Westron name was Trahald, of the meaning \"burrowing, worming in or \"apt to creep into a hole\". In both Westron and Old English, Sméagol's name is related to Smaug's: Smaug's name in \"true Dalish\" was Trâgu, and the Trah- stem in Trahald and Trâgu is thus a cognate of the Germanic stem present in both Sméagol, and Smaug (with a meaning of squeezing through a hole.)","In the animated versions of both The Hobbit and The Return of the King, Gollum was voiced by comedian Brother Theodore.","In The Return of the King, Serkis himself appears in flashback scene as Sméagol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for The Two Towers but held back because it was felt that audiences would relate better to the original Sméagol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Gollum's face had to be redesigned for the second and third movies so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'. (The brief glimpses in The Fellowship of the Ring are of an older portrayal of Gollum.)","Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor"],"name":"Gollum","description":"In the first edition of The Hobbit, Tolkien made no reference to his size, leading several illustrators to portray him as being very large. Tolkien realized the omission, and clarified in later editions that he was of average hobbit size and in \"The Lord of the Rings\", there is a reference to Sam being \"little less in height\" than he is. Tolkien describes Gollum as either dark, bone-white or sallow (pale yellow): at one point, the Men of Ithilien mistake his silhouette (seen from a distance) for a tailless black squirrel. Gorbag and Shagrat describe him as a dark fellow. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the appearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that Gollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor light. The Hobbit states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth sharpening rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing. Despite these details, he is generally depicted wearing a loincloth or naked in illustrations and adaptations.\n\nGollum was a good survivor and was very keen eyed and quick of hand this made him an excellent fisherman. He could spot and catch fish in almost any level of light and waters. He fished the waters of the Misty Mountain's underground lake for centuries in almost complete darkness and almost anywhere he had to after leaving his cave in search of the Ring and the thief Baggins. He was known to eat almost anything that was living or edible and could stomach anything raw and uncooked. He was also very good at not being seen and was an excellent waterman making use of anything that could float which made it possible for him to follow the Fellowship for so long.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gollum"}}

In TA 2976, he married Finduilas of Dol Amroth, daughter of Prince Adrahil II of Dol Amroth. Together, the couple had two sons, Boromir and Faramir. A few years later, in TA 2988, Finduilas died, leaving Denethor bitter.\n\nHe succeeded his father Ecthelion II as the twenty-sixth Ruling Steward in TA 2984. During his stewardship, Gandalf was less welcome in Minas Tirith and his counsels went unheeded.\n\nDenethor secretly used a Palantír to probe Sauron's strength, and he used it at the top of the White Tower in his secret chamber, above the Throne room. The effort aged him quickly, and the knowledge of Sauron's overwhelming force exacerbated the bitterness that had taken root at the time of the death of his wife, Finduilas, in TA 2988. Sauron used the Palantír to drive him mad with despair. He retained, however, an air of nobility and power. The death of Boromir, his eldest son and favorite, and the siege and apparent doom of the capital city drove Denethor further along the path to madness. Following this, he became estranged from Faramir. Shockingly, Faramir still upheld his father's wishes.\n\nHis actions, however, did not immediately proclaim his insanity. The Osgiliath mission was not obviously suicidal, as the city had not yet been overrun. The Warning beacons of Gondor had indeed been lit, although Denethor expected little help, because of the fatalistic mindset that he had at that time of sorrow.\n\nHe committed suicide on March 15, 3019, having ordered his men to erect a pyre for him and Faramir in the Hallows of Minas Tirith. He threw a torch onto the pyre, then broke the white rod of his office over his knee and cast it into the flames, symbolizing the end of his stewardship and the end of the rule of the Stewards. He laid himself down on the table and so perished, clasping the Palantíri in his hands. His attempt to take the grievously injured and apparently dying Faramir with him was thwarted by the timely intervention of Beregond and ultimately, by Gandalf.\n\nDenethor II ruled as the Steward of Gondor for 35 years, from TA 2984 until his death on TA 3019. The title of the Ruling Steward was passed to his son, Faramir, who also became the first of the Princes of Ithilien.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Denethor_II"}}

As such, he began to experiment with ways to create new, deadlier creatures for use in his armies. Glaurung was the result of these experiments. After a century of brooding and growing in the dark pits of Angband, Glaurung first emerged in FA 260 and attacked the Elves maintaining the Siege of Angband. Though Glaurung was not of the winged race that would later arise, he was the greatest terror of his time. He burned and ravaged Ard-galen, the land of the Elves in Hithlum and Dorthonion. However, he was not yet at his full strength, so was driven back by Fingon, the prince of Hithlum at that time, and his archers. Morgoth was displeased with Glaurung for revealing himself before he had grown to full strength, as Morgoth had planned for Glaurung's existence to be a complete surprise.\n\nTo Glaurung, this attack was merely a youthful testing of his strength. Terrible as he was to the Elves, the armor of his scales was still vulnerable to the bite of weapons. However, despite his untimely foray, Morgoth's plans were not disrupted.\n\nGlaurung was contained in Angband for another two centuries before he was again loosed during the Fourth Battle of the Battles of Beleriand. Known as the Dagor Bragollach for the fires unleashed by Morgoth from the Iron Mountains, Glaurung in full power led Melkor's forces against the High Elves of Beleriand. Now fully grown, none could withstand his might, and with the Balrogs at his side, Glaurung led the Orcs to an overwhelming victory and broke the siege of Angband.\n\nIn the fifth battle, the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Glaurung caused even more destruction, as he had fathered a brood of lesser Dragons to follow him into battle. So a great army of Elves and Men fell before the onslaught, for none could withstand the Dragonfire save the Dwarves of Belegost, who had come to battle a common foe.\n\nAfter the Elven and Edain armies had been broken, Morgoth used Glaurung to hold the territories he gained; but force in battle was not the only power the monster knew. He brought many under his sway with the binding power of his serpent eye and hypnotic Dragon Spell.\n\nAfter Glaurung aided Morgoth during the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, he was given the assignment to complete the Sack of Nargothrond, one of the Elven fortresses in Beleriand. Glaurung came upon Nargothrond with great force, and sacked the kingdom easily. He faced Túrin, son of Húrin, at the gate and so he froze Túrin with his eyes. Túrin heard the screams of Finduilas, daughter of Orodreth, as he stood there. When the captives had been taken away, Glaurung unfroze Túrin and gave him two choices: the first to follow Finduilas, and the second to aid his mother and sister, who were suffering in Dor-lómin. Túrin chose the latter, and in this way he was deceived by the dragon, for his mother and sister were living well in Doriath. Glaurung then gathered up all the treasures of Felagund and hoarded them deep within Nargothrond's underground halls, he then sat atop his hoard, guarding it jealously, and so he rested.\n\nGlaurung received knowledge of Morwen and Nienor's departure to seek their family members. In the forest where they were travelling, Glaurung found Nienor and caused her to lose her mind. This caused her to run through the forest \"like a deer\". Soon after this, Túrin found her crying on Finduilas's grave. Not knowing that she was his sister, Túrin named her Níniel (Tear maiden) and took her to his home with the folk of Brandir. There they lived for the next three years, during which they fell in love.\n\nAfter those years, Glaurung attacked the area around their home. Túrin resolved to kill the dragon. Two men went with him. One became afraid and fled, and the other was crushed by rocks. However, Túrin was able to kill Glaurung by thrusting his sword, Gurthang, into Glaurung's belly. Glaurung felt his death wound and screamed. When the dragon's blood touched Túrin, he fell into a swoon. Glaurung screamed until his strength was gone. Nienor found him there, with Túrin beside him. With his last breath, Glaurung gave Nienor her memory back, and died. Shortly thereafter, Nienor jumped into the river below, and Túrin awoke and threw himself on his sword.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Glaurung"}}

When Ulmo returned for the Teleri, Círdan and his followers remained behind, partially because of their love for Belegaer, and partially because of his kinship with Elwë, who was lost. After Elwë returned and became King Thingol, Círdan ruled the Falathrim of the havens of Eglarest and Brithombar, although he seemed to have accepted Thingol's overlordship. Later he became an advisor and friend of Finrod Felagund, Lord of Nargothrond, although the Falas remained independent.","Círdan was early on warned by Ulmo not to attempt a crossing to Valinor, and his mariners restricted their work to the coasts of Middle-earth. However, at the request of King Turgon of Gondolin, he later built several messenger ships to sail to Valinor to request help from the Valar against Morgoth. All these missions failed, and only one survivor ever returned. After the havens of the Falas were destroyed by FA 474, Círdan was instrumental in setting up the refuges at the Mouths of Sirion and the Isle of Balar, to which he retired for the remainder of the age.

The name was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Sindarin names such as Legolas, Nimrodel, and Thranduil.","Legolas sang an extract from a long and sad song to Frodo Baggins by the banks of the Nimrodel.

He became the last of the ruling Sindar over Lorien.\n\nAmroth's beloved, a beautiful Elf Maiden named Nimrodel, regretted that Elves from Beleriand, which was under assault by Morgoth, were being admitted into Lothlórien. She believed that these foreign Elves brought wars and destroyed the peace that Lothlórien's inhabitants had once enjoyed. When Dwarves were driven out of Moria by Orcs and also settled in Lothlórien, Nimrodel fled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age). Amroth followed her to the forest, which was much closer to Lothlórien than it later became. Nimrodel was too afraid to enter the forest, as she believed that the trees were menacing and some of them moved to bar her entrance.\n\nThere, Amroth and Nimrodel had a long discussion. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that she would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.\n\nAmroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothlórien, even if a time came when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at peace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again. He suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering Seas to the Undying Lands.\n\nAmroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a haven south of Lothlórien, long ago. Although the majority of those elves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was aware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to any of the other elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made the necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothlórien.\n\nHowever, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked for Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south towards the Sundering Seas.\n\nAt the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few remaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to leave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they welcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They hoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the White Mountains, where many unfriendly Men and evil creatures lived.\n\nThe summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was expected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that Amroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from their houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for many weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not arrive.\n\nOne night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor came from the Northern Wastes, swept through Eriador and caused an enormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men of Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind broke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far from the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.\n\nAt dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when Amroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full of despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the water below and drowned.\n\nThe ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely that the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol Eressëa, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the Great Journey.\n\nNeither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were many legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.\n\nThe Elf Maiden shared her name with a stream where she once lived, which indirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend, Amroth's voice continued to emanate from the sea and Nimrodel's voice often resonated from the stream that shared her name.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Amroth"}}

She bore him twin sons, Elrond and Elros. Elrond later went on to marry Lady Celebrian, daughter of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel of Lothlórien. From this marriage they produced three children, Elladan and Elrohir, twin brothers, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor.

That they were wargs, and not ordinary wolves searching for food, Gandalf remarked, was evident from the fact that their carcasses were not to be seen the next morning."],"name":"Warg","description":"In T.A. 2941, the wargs appeared once to meet the goblins and organize a raid on the nearby villages, in order to drive the woodmen out and capture some slaves. As a pack of wargs approached east of the Misty Mountains to meet them, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and Thorin and Company were escaping the goblins. Gandalf, seeing the pack coming, suggested to climb the trees and Dori helped Bilbo just in time.\n\nThe wargs, thinking that the Dwarves were allies of the woodmen, surrounded the glade and didn't let them descend. Gandalf then used his magic to light up pine-cones and hurl them against the wargs, until they were driven out. The wolves that had caught fire fled into the forest and had set it alight in several places, since it was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. However the guards left under the trees did not go away. Eventually goblins showed up and lit the trees the dwarves were hiding in, until the eagles came to rescue them.\n\nIn TA 3019 on January 13, the Fellowship of the Ring was attacked by a group of wargs. These wargs were presumably sent by Saruman to waylay the Fellowship after their failed attempt to cross the Redhorn Pass. The wargs fled after their first assault, but came back with reinforcements. Eventually, this second assault also failed, and the wargs fled again. Under the cover of night, the wargs dragged the bodies of their fallen comrades away from the site.\n\nIn the books, wargs are described as being giant, intelligent, and malevolent wolves.\n\nThe word 'warg' comes from the Old Norse word vargr, meaning 'wolf'.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's works, two breeds are introduced. The first are a hyena-like breed used by Isengard and Mordor orcs that roamed in western Rhovanion and the wilds to the east of the Misty Mountains. The second are the more wolf-like Gundabad wargs whose appearance is closer to the original version of the story.\n\nThe eastern Wargs seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy are noticeably more hyena-like in appearance. An eastern warg measures about 5 feet at the shoulder, and could be up to eight feet in length from snout to hindquarters. The head has a short muzzle full of huge fangs, small eyes set on the sides of the head and ears at the back of the skull. This arrangement gave greatest sensory range while keeping its vulnerable areas protected, and the long neck gives it reach, flexibility and power when biting into flesh. Apart from its ruff, the warg had short dense fur, which would have kept injury from tooth and claw to a minimum. Not all damage could have come from the men and beasts it was attacking; wargs were ferocious and could quickly turn on other members of their pack as well as their handlers. Coloration and pattern of the fur doesn't seem to vary throughout the breed. Powerful haunches and a dewclaw allowed the warg to climb.\n\nThe Gunbabad wargs, wolf-like with grey fur, are bred by the orcs of Mount Gundabad. Throughout the events of The Hobbit Trilogy, a pack of wargs are in the service of Azog, who had survived the skirmish at Moria. Among these wargs is a larger one with a white pelt that Azog rides, revealed in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey guide book to be the Warg Matriarch of the Gunbabad Wargs. Gandalf once stated in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey that the Gundabad wargs are faster than any other warg breed.\n\nDuring the events of An Unexpected Journey, a warg pack under Warg riders led by Yazneg and Fimbul stalk The Company of Thorin II Oakenshield before making their presence known in the trollshaws. Though Radagast offers to distract their pursuers by riding on his sled pulled by Rhosgobel Rabbits, the warg riders see the Company and chase after them before finding themselves ambushed by the elves of Rivendell after the Company flees into the Hidden Pass. Azog later feeds Yazneg to the wargs at the orc camp at Amon Sûl. Azog later rides the Warg Matriarch to personally hunt Thorin, who manages to elude him with the aid of both the Great Eagles at the Misty Mountains and Beorn. The Gundabad wargs make fewer appearances in the The Desolation of Smaug, when Bolg and a small force of warg riders trail the company to Dale, and The Battle of the Five Armies, where Azog rides the Warg Matriarch on the march to Erebor before instructing Bolg to retrieve their reinforcements in Gundabad. In the extended edition of The Battle of the Five Armies, a company of forty Gundabad wargs, including between fifteen and twenty warg riders, are part of Azog's massive army and also participate in the final battle outside the city of Dale and the dwarven kingdom of Erebor.\n\nIn The Two Towers film, Saruman sends the orc Sharku with a company of warg riders to attack the people of Rohan as they make their way to Helm's Deep. A warg later appears as the mount for Gothmog during the Siege of Gondor in The Return of the King film. In the commentary for the extended DVD, Jackson says that the scene was chaotic to shoot and the wargs were the only computer generated creatures he felt could have looked more convincing. He also thought the scene itself could have turned out better if his team had a more organized storyboard layout for the battle.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Warg"}}

His skill as a fighter is later shown by how he is put in charge of the Orc packs whilst Azog stays to fight Gandalf.

During the early days Arda, Ossë rebelled against his Lord Ulmo (Lord of All Waters) and served Melkor instead, being carried away by the false promises that Melkor gave to him. From then on, for a while, there rose great tumults in the sea that wrought great ruins to the lands. At that point, and also because of the prayers of Aulë who created those lands, Uinen helped bring Ossë back to the allegiance of their lord Ulmo by restraining her husand and bringing him before Ulmo. Following that, Uinen's husband was pardoned and gave his allegiance back to the Valar remaining thereafter faithful then ever to them. To the Maiar Uinen and Ossë, Ulmo their lord gave them the task of the governing of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas. Plus ever afterwards, Uinen was the one who restrained her Spouse's violence in the seas and on the coasts.\n\nLater on, the Teleri remained long on the coast of the western seas, awaiting still for Ulmo to take them to Aman. Likewise, Uinen and Ossë came among the Teleri at the coasts and befriended them. In addition, the Teleri had much love for Uinen and her spouse, for Uinen and Ossë continued being friends with the Teleri who then dwelt by the mouths of the great river Sirion of Beleriand which flowed into the sea. Ultimately, the Teleri with their King Olwë at last reached Aman where they built their dwelling as a city-haven named 'Alqualondë' on the shores of Eldamar in Aman. However later on, the 'Kinslaying at Alqualondë' took place at the Swanhaven of the Teleri where Fëanor, eldest son of King Finwë of the Ñoldor, and his host of exiled Ñoldor attacked the Teleri and forcefully stole their white ships for their voyage to Middle-earth. Notwithstanding though, Uinen wept for the many of the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the sea.<\/span> What's more, the sea then rose in great wrath by Uinen against the Noldorin slayers in that so many of the Telerin ships were wrecked and those of the Ñoldor in them were drowned.\n\nWhen the Hiding of Valinor took place, Ossë raised the enchanted Isles. Then next, Uinen enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by weaving them in her hair before Irmo (Master of Dreams & Desires) put them to age-long sleep.\n\nDuring the Second Age, the mariners of Númenór would cry to Uinen for help, because she was the only one capable of calming Ossë who loved to create tumults in the seas, And the Númenóreans lived under her protection while their respect for the Valar endured. Therefore, the Númenóreans held the Maia Uinen in reverence as equal to the Valar.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Uinen"}}

Tolkien as \"... a dark, still lake\" which was created by the damming of the Sirannon river. The water had crept deeper and deeper, closer and closer to The Doors of Durin leaving only a narrow walkway where once The High Road allowed traffic between Ost-in-Edhil and Khazad-dûm many years before during The Second Age. Some say it was the creature itself who created the dam over many decades."],"name":"Watcher in the Water","description":"The Watcher is thought to have emerged from beneath Moria, being described by Gandalf as \"older, fouler\" than Orcs. During the attempted recolonization of Moria by the Dwarves, the Watcher killed Óin when his reconnaissance party visited the West Gate.\n\nWhen the Fellowship arrives by the pool of water, many immediately begin to feel an evil feeling emanating from the water. Boromir attempted to throw a rock into the water, for which he was reprimanded by Frodo. After Gandalf opened the gates and the fellowship moved towards the entrance, the Watcher attacked Frodo using its many long tentacles to grab hold of his legs. Sam slashed at the tentacles that were grabbing his friend, managed to injure the monster and it released the Hobbit. Gandalf then commanded that the Fellowship run further into the gate to escape the Watcher's wrath. The enraged monster's tentacles tore down the ancient holy trees which stood on either side of the doors, the beautiful doors of Durin and many boulders, thus trapping the Fellowship inside the Long Dark Of Moria.\n\nThe Watcher in the Water can be seen in Peter Jackson's rendition of The Fellowship of the Ring as a very detailed computer-generated creature. In the movie, the Watcher is disturbed by Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, who throw rocks in the water to pass the time while Gandalf tries to figure out the password to gain entrance to Moria. This differs from the novel, in which it was Boromir who disturbed the water by throwing a stone. In either case, by the time the riddle of the Door is figured out (\"Speak 'friend' and enter.\" - by Frodo in the film and Gandalf in the original novel), the Watcher is already provoked. It catches Frodo and lifts him in the air, despite Samwise Gamgee's attempts to defend him. The rest of the Fellowship, who attempt to injure the many serpentine tentacles of the Watcher, save him. The Watcher drops Frodo when it is injured and he is caught by Boromir. Legolas shoots the Watcher in the eye as the Fellowship of the Ring retreats into the Mines of Moria. Just as they make it inside, the Watcher tears down the doorway, and the way out is blocked by falling rocks, which land on the Watcher and probably kill it. After the gate is blocked, the Fellowship is then forced to travel into the darkness of Moria. Although Tolkien described it to have twenty-one tentacles, Peter Jackson instead gave it twelve visible tentacles (this was due to the effects team finding that twenty-one tentacles were difficult to render properly). In the game adaptation of the novel, the Watcher is depicted as a Nessie-like creature with many arms.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, the Watcher in the Water is the first real boss that Berethor's party has to face. Its attacks consist mainly of tentacle attacks and \"Reeking Spout\", a gust of foul breath and slime that deals significant damage to the whole party. After a brief but fierce battle, Berethor's company is able to anger the Watcher enough to clear the way for them to enter Moria. Shortly after, they end up fighting the Watcher again, this time in a huge lake that has flooded part of Moria. When they fight it this time, they kill it for good.\n\nHowever, this game is non-canonical to the book, and even to the movie, so the watcher's fate is still unknown. His head could have been crushed by the falling boulders.\n\nIn Battle for Middle-earth II, the Watcher in the Water is a power to use as Isengard\/The Goblins or in the Evil Campaign or even a Skirmish. When it attacks, it uses its tentacles to smack any surrounding enemies. When picking up an enemy with one of its tentacles, it eats it and its health heals. It is a commander on the Good Campaign in Missions 2, 6 & 8.When it dies or its time is done it goes back into the water pool where it goes to its home until it is summoned again. In Evil campaign it cost 10 power points while in a Skirmish it costs 15 power points.\n\nUpon beginning Volume 2, the Mines of Moria in earnest, the player enters Moria with his\/her legendary, which can be named and tailored to a specific play-style, making the new weapons very innovative and much more powerful than regular weapons. Before entering Moria, the prologue has the player at the walls of Moria. After completing a series of quests you may enter Moria. However, the first expedition goes wrong, and the watcher takes Broin (please correct this if this is incorrect). While Broin is not dead, several other Dwarves are killed and the group flees. Upon returning, you have been granted a legendary weapon, which is capable of hurting the watcher. After a prolonged fight of tentacle cutting and more hacking and slashing, the watcher retreats and you may enter Moria. In one of the playable dungeons (known as instances) you may kill the watcher, which gives one of the rarest and infamous trophies. However, it takes a large group to do this raid, or a group of high level players. It is recommended that before starting Moria you are level 50 and have completed volume 1 (in which you aid Gandalf and the fellowship by fighting the False king of Angmar's forces). It is also noted that the killing of the watcher was never confirmed in the books.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Watcher_in_the_Water"}}

They decided to cause a rebellion in Rhudaur against their 'masters', Arnor. Without knowing anything about Hwaldar's alliance with Angmar, Argeleb chained Hwaldar and built fortifications all over Rhudaur in order to silence the rebellion.\n\nSome time after, Morgomir convinced the Witch-king to send an army to rescue Hwaldar. They attacked Arthedain's outpost where Hwaldar was chained, ending his imprisonment with Morgomir's blade. Hwaldar found himself rescued and was sent with soldiers of Angmar to demand allegiance from the nearby Hill-men tribes. Those that rejected, where slaughtered, and their tents plundered. The army continued after constructing a minor fortification to cross the river to the west, therefore attacking Arthedain's two outposts, in the process of the march to the second outpost, King Argeleb arrives and threw in his share of reinforcements. The battle of Rhudaur ends with the Witch-king conquering Rhudaur and slaying King Argeleb.\n\nHwaldar is an early Hero geared towards being used in the beginning of a fight and rapidly bringing in resources while harassing the enemy without engaging in full on warfare against heavier units. His first ability is a passive that boosts the attack, defense and experience gained of all hill-men by 20%, which is weaker then the usual 50%  associated with most heroes but is offset by how easy it is to spam the hill-men. His second ability is also a passive, any hill-men including Hwaldar that kills any units gains that units build pay returned to the player. The ability allows Hwaldar and a large amount of hill-men to rapidly build up the resources of the Angmar faction and get an early start on mid-game and even end-game powers and units. His third and final ability allows him to summon hill-men upon command, and while it is gained at level 5, it summons a larger amount of units the higher Hwaldars level is.\n\nWhile these attributes make Hwaldar a threat to opponents and an extremely useful Hero in the beginning, he will begin to rapidly lose effectiveness by about mid-game and become fairly useless by end-game. Hwaldar is a very soft target, making it easy to bring him down with advanced weapons, and as more powerful infantry begin to appear in the fight his buffs on his infantry begin to be outclassed by more powerful hero abilities of the opposing faction (Lurtz, King Dain, etc.) and his hill-men allies will be easily slaughtered. However if used correctly he can be useful even in the end game, as his summon hill-men ability can be used as a meatshield to protect the more powerful and expensive infantry and offer a potential cash boost if they kill any units near him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hwaldar"}}

They were part of the armies of Saruman who attacked Rohan twice in the Battles of the Fords of Isen, and of the 10,000 that attacked the Rohirrim in the Hornburg, where most of them perished at the Battle of the Hornburg, either before the fortress walls or in the Huorn's forest.\n\nThe rest of them were killed in the pits of Isengard, mostly because of the huge flood the Ents made when they descended upon Isengard with wrath. Some lived beyond that day of doom and followed Saruman into exile, even during the Scouring of the Shire, where they served the fallen wizard with others until his last breath. In the Shire, they were all killed along with their fellow villains the Ruffians in the Battle of Bywater and buried in the Battle Pit.\n\nThe first appearance of these half-goblins occurs in Fellowship of the Ring in describing one known as the Southerner, a spy of Saruman's;\n\nFurther description follows in The Two Towers:\n In \"The Scouring of the Shire\", there are further mention of the half-orcs under Sharkey's control, and they are described as men having squinty (or slanty) eyes and sallow complexion (a description used to describe the Southerner, Saruman's spy in Fellowship of the Ring, as well as some of the orcs in the Two Towers). Which seems to suggest that they look mostly human but share some of the features of the orcs.\n\nIn the film The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf tells Elrond at Rivendell that Saruman has cross-bred orcs with goblin-men.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Half-orc"}}

Ar-Pharazôn grew into a Man of great strength, stature, and will, not unlike the ancient heroes of the Edain. In these earlier days, he was good friends with Amandil, the future Lord of Andúnië and his line of people. However, he was his father's child and thus was instructed to follow in the ways of the King's Men.\n\nAr-Pharazôn became a man of great pride and was eager for more wealth and glory. He grew restless in his homeland and was often abroad leading like-minded Númenóreans in the wars that they were waging against the men of Middle-earth. In this he fared well on both land and sea for he won great wealth, and gained great respect as a captain. When he finally returned home, the people rejoiced in him and he was very popular and generous with the wealth and fortunes he won in Middle-earth.\n\nUpon the death of his uncle, Tar-Palantir, who had no son, Ar-Pharazôn decided to wed his daughter, Míriel, which was against her will. As Tar-Míriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn was able to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name Ar-Zimraphel, refusing to use the Elven speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges of the Faithful.\n\nAs time passed, it came to his attention that Sauron, the Lord of Mordor, was expanding his power throughout Middle-earth and was being called the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, ever prideful, resolved to challenge him lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Mordor with an army so powerful that Sauron's forces simply deserted him. But Sauron was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharazôn's might. However, Ar-Pharazôn did not trust Sauron, and brought him back to Númenor as a hostage. However, Sauron quickly took advantage of his situation to gain Ar-Pharazôn's trust, and by way of careful flattery, lies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted advisor. He was able to corrupt Ar-Pharazôn, convincing him to worship Morgoth in the hope that he would be able to cheat mortality. Some of the results of Sauron's cunning were the erecting of a Great Temple to Morgoth, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of the White Tree of Númenor. Soon the king and his followers were worshiping Morgoth openly and burning innocents at the altar of the temple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god.\n\nThen, as Ar-Pharazôn felt the bite of old age upon him, Sauron was able to convince him to attack Valinor and claim the right to immortality by force. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to attack Valinor in SA 3310 and finally broke the Ban of the Valar, landing on the shores of the Undying Lands in SA 3319. The Valar then laid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One. He sank Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and all of Númenor beneath the ocean, changing the shape of the world. Valinor was no longer connected to Middle-earth, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only elves and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it following the Straight Road into the far west. Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host who landed on Aman were buried by mounds of dirt and remain in the Caves of the Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath.

He came to her and told her of his plans. Though she was tempted greatly by Melkor's plan for her to drink the light of the Two Trees of Valinor, she feared the power of the Valar and was hesitant to accompany him. To mollify her, Melkor offered to sate her hunger with whatever she wished if she would aid him in his vengeance. She agreed, and they came shortly thereafter to Ezellohar, where she drained the Trees of their sap, poisoned them, and drank the Wells of Varda dry. The Unlight produced by Ungoliant stymied the pursuit of Oromë and Tulkas, and Melkor escaped to Middle-earth with her. However, her consumption of power of the Trees and the Wells caused her to swell to a size and shape so vast and hideous that even Melkor began to grow afraid.\n\nWhen they arrived in Lammoth in Middle-earth, Melkor, now known as Morgoth, hoped to escape to the ruins of Angband where the remnants of his forces awaited him. Suspecting that he intended to leave his promise to her unfulfilled, Ungoliant demanded the gems that Morgoth had stolen from Formenos before they could reach Angband. She devoured them, and grew to an even more monstrous size. She then demanded that Morgoth surrender to her the Silmarils. However, Morgoth refused, and she attacked him. Weaving her dark webs, she attempted to enmesh him in her nets and take the Silmarils by force. Morgoth gave out a terrible cry of pain as she attacked, which was heard by the Balrogs hibernating under the ruins of Angband. They awoke and immediately rushed to the aid of their Lord, tearing apart Ungoliant's webbing with their fiery whips and forcing her to break off her attack. She fled, and the Balrogs prepared to pursue and destroy her, but they were checked by Morgoth, who ordered them to return with him to Angband. Ungoliant's attack upon Morgoth left an echoing scream ever after on the land that gave the area the name Lammoth, and it is said to this day that when one screams in that place, the voice of the Dark Lord echoes back from the surrounding hills.\n\nDriven off by the Balrogs, Ungoliant fled to Nan Dungortheb, where she bred with the Great Spiders that dwelt there, increasing the terror and power of her kind. The creatures that later infested the area were her surviving offspring and descendants, including her infamous daughter, Shelob, who dwelt from the Second and Third Ages onwards on the borders of Mordor, as her last surviving child. It is said that Ungoliant ultimately perished at her own hands when, in her ever growing and eternal hunger, she eventually devoured herself. But others say, it was Ungoliant in the South he slew, and her darkness was destroyed, and light came to many regions which had yet long been hid. Towards the end of the First Age, she had captured the sun (Arien\/Urwendi) with her gloom nets and Earendil encountered her on his journey across the seas on the Vingilot. Earendil ultimately freed Urwendi freeing the Magic Sun.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ungoliant"}}

After Gollum asked a riddle about what \"ruins kingdoms\" and \"beats tall mountains down\", Bilbo tried to think of all the giants and ogres that he had heard of. None of them, however, were destructive enough to meet the description of the riddle.\n\nIt is possible that ogres were a mythical monster in Hobbit folklore rather than an actual race. It is also possible that, like Giants and the term \"Fairy\", they were simply dropped as Tolkien expanded Middle-earth and the related cosmology (however note that while giants do not appear in The Lord of the Rings they are mentioned multiple times).\n\nIn the earlier legends of Middle-earth written before the release of the Hobbit (but which elements of the Hobbit were roughly based on) the ogres were one of the Úvanimor; the monsters, giants, and ogres (and later Wicked dwarves) who were bred from earth by Melkor. They feared the sinews of Tulkas arm and his iron-clad fists, when he had cause for wrath. It is said that Túvo protected Men and Elves from them and from \u2018evil fays\u2019, and the Orcs besides. Among the ogres were the Sarqindi, the Cannibal-ogres.\n\nHúrin once fought beside Beren against \"ogres and Orcs and evil foemen\".\n\nGothmog was a son of Melkor and the ogress Fuiluthin and his name is Strife-and-hatred, and he was Captain of the Balrogs and lord of Melko's hosts ere fair Ecthelion slew him at the taking of Gondolin.\n\nVoronwë and Eärendil set sail in Vingilot and were driven south to the dark regions where the fire mountains were. There they encountered Tree-men, Pygmies and the Sarqindi.\n\nOgres appear briefly in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. They are stated in to have been based off Half Trolls, suggested to be somewhere between the largest orcs and the smallest trolls. They served in Azog's Army as both shock troops and Troll commanders. One commanded a team of catapult trolls. Several Ogres appear in Dale and two are killed by Bard the Bowman. One of the them, notably, had an abnormally small left arm, while his right arm that held his club was more proportionate to the size of his body.\n\nIn the extended edition, Azog orders a group of Ogres to destroy the Dwarvish war chariots at the beginning of the battle. The Ogres successfully accomplish their mission, knocking down the machines and killing Dwarves with their maces. Some time later, Azog sends another group of Ogres to bring down the chariot used by Dwalin, Balin, Fili and Kili on their way to Ravenhill. However, the spiked wheels of the chariot behead all the attacking Ogres.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ogres"}}

The following year, his grandfather Ecthelion II died and his father, Denethor, succeeded him as the Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nWhen Faramir was five years old, Finduilas died. Her death caused Denethor to become detached from his family. The relationship between Faramir and Boromir, who was five years elder of the brothers, grew much closer and greater in love. Despite the obvious way that Denethor favored Boromir over Faramir, there was no jealousy or rivalry between them. Boromir protected and helped him, and Faramir looked up to his older brother. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance with their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality. Boromir was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more fearless and strong warrior. Faramir\u2019s boldness was incorrectly judged less due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music.\n\nIt was this interest that formed a friendship between Faramir and Gandalf the Grey. The youngest son of Denethor learned of what he could from Gandalf\u2019s wisdom and mentoring. Denethor did not approve of Faramir as the \"Wizard's pupil\", for he neither trusted nor liked the Istar.\n\nFaramir's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved to be handy on the battlefield. During the War of the Ring, he was the Captain of the Rangers of Ithilien, who often skirmished with the allies of Sauron in that province. Faramir valiantly defended Gondor from the Enemy, but did not enjoy fighting for war\u2019s sake.\n\nIn June of 3018, Sauron's forces attacked Osgiliath, under the command of the Witch-king, whose presence caused the soldiers to draw back across the Anduin. When the last bridge was destroyed, in which Boromir\u2019s and Faramir's companies remained, the two brothers, along with two others, swam to shore and managed to hold all of the west shores of the Anduin.\n\nThe night before the assault, Faramir had a prophetic dream of a voice speaking the following riddle:\n\nIt came to Faramir twice more and once to his brother, and the brothers told of their dream to Denethor, who only told them that Imladris was an Elvish name for Rivendell, home of Elrond the Half-elven. Although Faramir had wanted to go for Gondor\u2019s sake and was originally chosen by the Council of Elders in Gondor, Boromir, with the urging of his father, stepped forward and claimed the right to the errand, deeming it to be dangerous and doubtful. The Gondorian traveled nearly four months to Rivendell, losing his horse in the process, and arriving just before the Council of Elrond.\n\nOn February 29, 3019 at midnight, Faramir, who was on guard duty on the western shore in Osgiliath, waded down to a boat floating down the Anduin River. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother, which was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but there was no sign of the Great Horn, which he and his father had heard being blown far across the distance in the North three days prior.\n\nDuring a battle with Southrons, Faramir, who took over his brother's position as the Captain of the White Tower, encountered the Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, recognizing them to be the Halflings his dream spoke of. After the skirmish, Faramir took the pair to Henneth Annûn and questioned them further.\n\nThrough intelligent questioning and intuition, Faramir determined that Frodo was carrying some great evil weapon of the Dark Lord of the Enemy. At this point, he showed the crucial difference between him and his proud brother:\n\nSam accidentally revealed Boromir's desire for the Enemy\u2019s Ring, Isildur's Bane. Despite the hobbits\u2019 fears, Faramir remained true to his vow that he would not take it even if it lay on the highway, for he was wise enough to realize that such a weapon could not be used for good. With this knowledge, he also realized the peril his brother had faced.\n\nOn the very same night, Gollum was spotted fishing in the Forbidden Pool next to Henneth Annûn -- an act punishable by death. Faramir listened to Frodo\u2019s pleads to spare Gollum\u2019s life though, and after interrogating the creature he deemed that Frodo and Sam would be free in the Lands of Gondor and Gollum under Frodo's protection. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest. At their parting, Faramir warned Frodo of Gollum's treacherous nature and that the path Gollum had proposed (Cirith Ungol) had an evil reputation of old.\n\nFaramir and his company retreated to Cair Andros, an island in the River Anduin that guarded the northern approaches to Minas Tirith. After noting that the sky was now covered in complete darkness, Faramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath while he and three others of his men rode to Minas Tirith directly. Along the way, they were pursued by the Nazgûl, riding fell beasts. The men, except Faramir, were unhorsed and it was the Captain, a master of both beasts and men, who was still horsed and rode back to aid the fallen. If Gandalf had not intervened, they would have surely perished.\n\nArriving at Minas Tirith, Faramir reported to Denethor and Gandalf of his encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor became angry that Faramir had not brought the ring to Gondor, wishing that he and his brother\u2019s places were reversed, since Denethor believed that Boromir would bring the Enemy\u2019s weapon to him.\n\nDenethor sent his remaining son to hold Western Osgiliath against the hosts of the Enemy that outnumbered their own greatly. Although Faramir disagreed with his father\u2019s strategy, he agreed to go.\n\nThe Witch-king overwhelmed the men of Gondor and won Osgiliath. Faramir drew back to the Causeway Forts, in which many of the men were wounded or killed. Faramir decided to stay with the rearguard in order to make sure that the retreat over Pelennor Fields would not turn into a disaster.\n\nFaramir was gravely wounded by a poisonous arrow during the retreat. Fortunately, Gandalf and Faramir\u2019s uncle, Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, rode to the aid of Faramir and the troops with hosts of cavalry. Imrahil bore Faramir back to Denethor, telling him that his son had done great deeds.\n\nRegretting that he had thanklessly sent his son off in needless peril without his blessing, Denethor, after looking in the Palantir, believing that the Ring was captured and the end was near, ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre for him and his son, who was believed to be poisoned by the Witch-king\u2019s dart. Despite the protests of the Hobbit, Pippin Took (serving the steward in payment of Boromir's death) that Faramir was still alive, Denethor continued with this madness and released him from his service.\n\nHorrified, Pippin went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower Guards. Beregond, who loved his captain enough to abandon his post and risk his life protecting him, stopped the servants from lighting the pyre. Pippin returned with Gandalf, who intervened by taking Faramir off the pyre as Faramir moaned out to his father in his dreams. Denethor took out a knife, trying to take Faramir back, but Beregond placed himself in front of Faramir. Seeing that he could not win, Denethor lit the pyre and laid himself down upon it, burning himself alive.\n\nThen, Faramir was laid in the Houses of Healing until Aragorn came and revived Faramir with athelas. It was not a poisoned dart of the Witch-king that wounded him in a state near death as it was with Snowmane, but the arrow of a Haradrim, along with Faramir\u2019s weariness and grief concerning his constantly strained relationship with his father and the Black Breath of the Nazgul, who, under Sauron's orders, hunted Faramir ever since he had left Ithilien. When he awoke, Faramir immediately recognized Aragorn as his rightful King, therefore realizing that no proof was needed after all.\n\nBefore Aragorn left to lead the soldiers to the Black gate, he commanded the Warden of the Houses of Healing to have Faramir and Éowyn to remain resting for at least ten days. After Éowyn demanded that the Warden take her to the Steward of the City to have her released so she could ride out in battle, Faramir, whose heart was moved with pity and pierced by her beauty, told Éowyn that he too, had to heed the advice of the Warden. He fulfilled her request to have her room look east to Mordor and asked her to talk with him at times.\n\nFaramir and Éowyn walked together in the gardens nearly every day, and he learned from Merry Brandybuck of Éowyn's despair of feeling trapped, waiting on the waning of Théoden, and Aragorn's rejection of Eowyn's love.\n\nOn March 25, Faramir gave Éowyn a dark blue mantle sewn with silver stars that had once belonged to his mother, as they stood at the wall that looked towards Mordor. There, they saw a threatening darkness towering over and seeing this, Faramir told her of his dream of the Downfall of Númenor that the darkness threatening to overtake Middle-earth reminded him of the great wave that swallowed the land of Númenor. Somehow, to Faramir and the people of the city, a hope and joy welled in their hearts and he kissed Éowyn\u2019s brow.\n\nÉowyn, however, still felt languished and unfulfilled. Several days after he\u2019d given her the mantle, Faramir told her that he understood that she desired to be lifted in greatness and out of the cage she had felt trapped in, and when Aragorn only gave her understanding and pity, instead of love (which she later realized was a shadow of love), she had wanted to die valiantly and gloriously in battle. He told her that though he had first pitied her, he now loved her. There, Éowyn\u2019s grief was fully healed, and no longer did she desire glory or greatness and realized that she had come to love Faramir in return.\n\nFaramir briefly served as the Ruling Steward of Gondor, and began preparing the city for the King's arrival. On the day of the King\u2019s official coronation on May 1st, Faramir surrendered his office, which was represented by the white rod of the Steward, kneeling as he did so. Aragorn however, gave the rod back, announcing that as long as his line would last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor. After Faramir had asked the people of Gondor if they accepted Aragorn as their King (which they did), Faramir took the crown out and Aragorn was crowned King Elessar.\n\nKing Elessar appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien, and Beregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of Ithilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth, Gondor's two highest-ranking nobles, became King Elessar's chief commanders. His duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul of evil-remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King\u2019s chief counselor as well as ruling Gondor in the King's absence.\n\nAfter marrying Éowyn, the two settled in Emyn Arnen, where they had at least one son (named Elboron), who succeeded him as Steward of Gondor, Prince of Ithilien, and Lord of Emyn Arnen, after Faramir's death in FO 82. One of his descendants was Barahir, who may have been the son of Elboron.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Faramir"}}

Fimbul later accompanied Yazneg, numerous other Gundabad Orcs and Wargs on an attack on Thorin's group and were led astray by Radagast the Brown who was using his rabbit pulled sled to act as a distraction for the Dwarves. However, when the Orc caught the Company's scent and was killed, both Fimbul and Yazneg were able to detect the Dwarves hiding in a small crevice and proceeded to attack until Elrond and his Elven warriors arrived and slayed many of the party and caused the two surviving Orcs to flee for their lives.\n\nAt Weathertop, where the other Gundabad Hunter Orcs had made their base, Fimbul and Yazneg arrived and had to report the Dwarves' escape, to their commander, Azog.

However, its appearance has been  mocked by reviewers, noting that it appears to have wings similar to a butterfly, appears to have fuzzy feet, has the head of a lion-like creature, and roars repeatedly. After its fall into the chasm of Khazad-dûm, it changes into a half snake, half demon-like creature.","The Balrog was also portrayed in Peter Jackson's live-action film trilogy, where it was a large, black creature covered in flame. Although Tolkien described it as being taller than a man but not huge, Durin's Bane in the film was practically enormous, at least twenty feet tall or so. Rather than having a voice of any kind, when it roared, it sounded similar to an erupting volcano - the vaporous presence of heat emanating as its breath. Its weapons, rather than physical in nature, were completely comprised of flame, taking the form of a sword first and a whip second. More than its use of obliteration, it was flames that were its key weapon of choice against Gandalf. The fight between the two plays out very much like the version in the book: Gandalf shatters the Balrog's fiery sword (using a magical shield in conjunction with Glamdring), and then breaks the bridge of Khazad-dûm. As the Balrog falls, its whip latches onto Gandalf's legs and drags him into the abyss.","The second flashback shows Gandalf and the balrog now dueling atop Mount Zirakzigil during a great storm, in which Gandalf manages to imbue his sword with electricity from a lightning strike and stabs the balrog through the heart, mortally wounding it and causing it to fall from the peak and crash onto the mountain side, its flames forever extinguished. ","In the game, Balrog made it harder for the Fellowship of the Ring to travel past him and by adding two dice to combat rolls in battle and offering three re-rolls on misses, he is possibly the most powerful character in the game when it comes to boosting combat. To limit his massive strength and make his use more canonical, he can be only used if he is \"Awakened\", while the Free People's player can put him back to sleep (effectively immobilizing him) in several ways, including using Gandalf. Though the thing is, if Balrog is rendered inactive anywhere outside Moria, he is permanently banished from gameplay.","The balrog appears in LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game. While its fight against Gandalf remains the same as in the film, it belches at one point, causing Gandalf to wave the fumes away in disgust. This same incarnation of the Balrog later appeared in LEGO Dimensions."],"name":"Durin's Bane","description":"Durin's Bane was one of the Maiar spirits that existed before the creation of the world (of the same order as Gandalf and Saruman), who descended into Arda with the Valar. It was eventually seduced and corrupted by Melkor, becoming one of the Valaraukar and joining with the other balrogs in Morgoth's service. The balrog fought in many battles of the War of the Jewels, up to and including the War of Wrath. It somehow managed to survive Morgoth's defeat, fleeing east and taking refuge beneath the Misty Mountains.\n\nFor more than five thousand years, the balrog lay dormant at the roots of Barazinbar. It remained undisturbed throughout the Second Age and most of the Third Age, until the miners of Dwarf-King Durin VI awoke it when they mined too deeply and too greedily in their search for mithril. The balrog slew Durin, and was thereafter known as Durin's Bane.\n\nThe dwarves attempted to fight the balrog, but its power was far too great. Despite their efforts to hold Khazad-dûm against it, King Náin and many of the dwarves were killed, and the survivors were forced to flee. News of the disaster reached the Silvan Elves of Lothlórien, who called the balrog the Nameless Terror (not knowing its true nature at the time) and began to refer to Khazad-dûm as Moria (dark abyss).\n\nFor five hundred years, Moria was left to the balrog. Sauron began to put his plans for war into effect around the year TA 2480 of the Third Age, and sent orcs and trolls to the Misty Mountains to bar all of the passes. Some of these creatures came to Moria, where they stayed in uneasy alliance with the balrog, which they feared.\n\nTolkien did not clarify whether Sauron was aware of the balrog's presence prior to this time, and thus the full extent of their alliance remains unclear.\n\nThe Balrog had a small but important role at the Battle of Azanulbizar, the climactic battle in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2799, the dwarves finally defeated the majority of the orcs occupying Moria, but Dáin II Ironfoot, having slain the orc Azog, felt the terror of the Balrog at the gate and declared that Moria itself remained beyond their power to conquer. Despite an attempt to recolonize Moria by Balin in TA 2989, Durin's Bane remained a menace in the ancient kingdom of the Dwarves, its true nature hidden to the outside world.\n\nIn January of TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring traveled through Moria on the way to Mordor. There, they were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul by orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when Gandalf, also a Maia, tried to place a \"shutting spell\" on the door to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on the other side and cast a \"terrible\" counterspell. Gandalf spoke a Word of Command to stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed. The company fled with Gandalf, but the orcs and the balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. At the Bridge, Legolas instantly recognized it as a Balrog, and Gimli recognized it as Durin's Bane. Gandalf then challenged it in order to allow the others to escape.\n\nThe balrog ignited its whole body in flames, then attacked with its flaming sword, which Gandalf destroyed with his own sword Glamdring. The Balrog ignited its body a second time, then took out its red-hot whip and swung it about. Gandalf then smote the Bridge before him with his staff. The staff broke asunder, a blinding sheet of white flame springing up, and the bridge cracked at the feet of the Balrog, who fell forward into the abyss. But as the Balrog fell, it swung its whip. The thongs of the whip wrapped around Gandalf's legs, dragging him over the edge and into the darkness below with the Balrog.\n\nAfter a long fall, the two crashed into a great subterranean lake, which Gandalf later said was as cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. The water quenched the Balrog's fire, reducing it to \"a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake\". Despite this relatively weak state, Durin's Bane renewed its attack on the wizard, and the two fought in the water, with the Balrog clutching at Gandalf to strangle him, and Gandalf hewing the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled into ancient tunnels of unknown origin. There, Gandalf pursued the creature out of the tunnels, back into Moria and up the Endless Stair. The chase ended atop the peak of Zirakzigil, or Celebdil, when the Balrog's bodily flames were renewed, restoring much of its power. There, beginning on the 23rd of Solmath, the pair of Maiar fought what was later known as the Battle of the Peak. After a climactic battle that spanned for an increasingly broad amount of days, Gandalf prevailed and finally slew the Balrog, casting it down from the peak and sending it crashing onto the mountain side. The wounded and exhausted Gandalf died shortly afterwards, but was eventually \"sent back, for a brief time, until his task was finished\". The great eagle Gwaihir the Windlord (lord of the Great Eagles of Middle-earth) found him and carried him to Lothlórien where he was healed and clothed in white \u2013 he had become Gandalf the White.\n\nThe ultimate fate of Durin's Bane is not known, as only its physical form died, as with all Maiar when they were \"killed,\" but what happened to the spirit of the balrog was not revealed. It is also unknown if it was the last of its kind, or if there were other Balrogs who managed to escape the War of Wrath and remained hidden in long forgotten places.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Durin%27s_Bane"}}

The Fellowship left Lothlórien after receiving several gifts. Legolas was given a new Galadhrim longbow, along with other gifts that Galadriel and Celeborn gave him and the rest of the Fellowship, such as Elven cloaks and Lembas, elven bread. While the Fellowship was travelling over the River Anduin, Legolas used his new bow to shoot down a nearby Nazgûl with one masterful shot in the dark.","After the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, Legolas stayed for the coronation of Aragorn and his marriage to Arwen. Later, Legolas and Gimli travelled together to Helm's Deep, visiting the Glittering Caves, and then later traveled through Fangorn Forest as Legolas and Gimli had agreed. Eventually, Legolas came to Ithilien with some of his people, with his father's leave, to live out his remaining time in Middle-earth helping to restore the devastated forests of that war-ravaged land. After the death of King Elessar, Legolas made a ship in Ithilien, and through Anduin, he left Middle-earth to go over the sea. His strong friendship with Gimli prompted him to invite Gimli to go to the Undying Lands; making him the first and only Dwarf to do so.","There might, however, be a certain meaning to his name: laeg is a very rare, archaic word for \"green\", which is normally replaced by calen (cf. Calenhad, mutated Parth Galen and plural Pinnath Gelin) and is otherwise almost only preserved in Laegrim, Laegel(d)rim (Sindarin form of Quenya Laiquendi), the Green Elves of the First Age. It may be that Thranduil named his son Legolas to at least in part refer to this people, who were remote kin and ancestors of the later Silvan Elves, the people Thranduil ruled.","Legolas has never been to Lórien before he travels there with the Fellowship. Therefore, we can assume that he was not with his grandfather's people when they left Lórien for Northern Mirkwood. Before the Shadow of Dol Guldur fell on Mirkwood in TA 1000, Legolas' people spent time amongst their Lórien neighbors. But when the Shadow fell, they \"retreated before it as it spread ever northward, until at last Thranduil established his realm in the north-east of the forest and delved there a fortress and great halls underground.\" So it seems likely that Legolas' birth-date was after TA 1000, when the Kingdom of Northern Mirkwood was created. This would make him younger than any other elf character in the series, including Arwen. In the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Legolas refers to his travelling companions many times as \"children\". Yet when he arrived at Fangorn, he claimed to feel young compared to the forest, saying, \"It is old, very old. So old that I almost I feel young again, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you children.\"","Legolas famously used an Elven bow, as well as a long, white dagger, both with lethal precision. He would prefer to pierce his enemies from afar, but his daggers were sometimes used for close combat. In Lothlorien, he was given a long-bow of the Galadhrim, which was longer and stouter than those of the fashion of Mirkwood. Nevertheless he adapts to his new bow and makes deadly use of it in the remainder of the War of the Ring. This bow had a draw weight of about 150 pounds. It could reputedly send an arrow with fatal force for over 400 yards. The bow was over six feet tall, and was made from a single piece of Mallorn heartwood. Its string had a single strand of Galadriel's hair entwined with it to help speed the arrow along even faster. Legolas' skill with the bow is revered, even as equal to that of Beleg Cúthalion in the First Age.","The Elves in Tolkien's legendarium were often associated as \"fairy-like\" beings who grew great in stature. However, when Legolas was visually rendered as \"pretty or lady-like\", Tolkien was \"wrathful\" and added a description as Legolas as:","John D. Rateliff speculates in The History of the Hobbit that had Tolkien gone on to finish the 1960 edit of the The Hobbit, proceeding to add to the Mirkwood scenes, it might have been possible Legolas would have been introduced.","In the extended version of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Legolas is shown to hold his liquor very well. Éomer challenged Legolas and Gimli to a drinking game.","After the battle, Legolas is once again confronted by his father, who allows him to be on his own. Thranduil suggests that Legolas must meet one of the Dunedain called Strider, and encourages Legolas to learn Strider's real name on his own.","Legolas has also been portrayed by Anthony Daniels in the 1978 Ralph Bakshi animated version of The Lord of the Rings.","Legolas was voiced by Frank Duncan in the 1956 radio series, by John Vickery in the 1979 radio series, and by David Collings in the 1981 BBC Radio 4 adaptation."],"name":"Legolas","description":"Although he lived among them and in their culture, Legolas was not fully of the Silvan Elves. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil, who had originally come from Doriath, Legolas was at least part Sindarin Elf, as his mother's identity is completely unknown. This is complicated by the fact that a small minority of Sindarin Elves ruled the predominantly Silvan Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood, a minority to which Legolas belonged. The Sindarin minority in that realm, who should have been nobler and wiser than the Silvan Elves can be seen as having \"gone native\" at the end of the First Age: after Morgoth was defeated and all of the grand Elf-kingdoms of Beleriand were destroyed, they can be seen as going back to \"a simpler time\" in their culture.\n\nLike all elves, Legolas has a great respect and appreciation for nature. While in Fangorn Forest he longed to return once more in order to explore its wonders more thoroughly. He is kind, and cares greatly for his friends, even Gimli the Dwarf, though it was a rarity for Elves and Dwarves to express a liking for one another because of their feud. Due to his age however, he sometimes seems rather patronizing toward the mortals around him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Legolas"}}

SA 1075 - SA 1280) was the seventh ruler and first Ruling Queen of Númenor. Her name means \"Most bright\".\n\nShe married the nobleman Hallacar, son of Hallatan of Hyarastorni. Both Tar-Ancalimë and Hallacar were fifth-generation descendants of King Vardamir Nólimon, and the marriage was more one of politics than of love. The Queen aimed to produce of an heir in order to secure her throne from her first cousin Soronto. Following the birth of their son, Hallacar and Tar-Ancalimë lived apart.\n\nTar-Ancalimë was raised by her mother Erendis and a childhood companion was Zamîn. Her mother's tragic married life might have influenced Tar-Ancalimë's rejection of her husband. She was succeeded by her son, Tar-Anárion. She died in year 1285, at the age of 412 years.\n\nTar-Telperiën (SA 1320 - SA 1731, r. SA 1556 - SA 1731) was the 10th ruler and second Ruling Queen of Númenor. She succeeded her father, King Tar-Súrion (who was King because his two elder sisters had no interest in ruling). She was named for Telperion, the Silver Tree of Valinor.\n\nTar-Telperiën ruled for 175 years. During her reign, the Rings of Power were forged, and Sauron conquered Eriador. She did little to react to these events. She refused to marry and bore no children. She was succeeded by Tar-Minastir, the son of her younger brother, Isilmo. She died in SA 1731 at the age of 411 years.\n\nTar-Vanimeldë (SA 2277 - SA 2637, r. SA 2526 - SA 2637) was the 16th ruler and third ruling Queen of Númenor. She was the daughter and heir of Tar-Telemmaitë. She had little interest in ruling, however, and left the day-to-day chores of monarchy to her husband, the nobleman Herucalmo. Her name means \"Beautiful Beloved\".\n\nTar-Vanimeldë ruled for 111 years. When she died in 2637 at the age of 360 years, the Kingship should have gone to her son, Tar-Alcarin, but Herucalmo usurped the throne and ruled for twenty years as King Tar-Anducal. His rule was not considered legitimate, and in the official records Vanimeldë was directly followed by Alcarin.\n\nMíriel was the daughter of King Tar-Palantir, and the rightful heir of Númenor. She should have been Queen, but her throne was usurped by her husband, Ar-Pharazôn, who gave her the name Ar-Zimraphel (as Ruling Queen she would have preferred the Quenya Tar-; she would have been Tar-Míriel). When the Valar sank Númenor, Míriel attempted to ascend Meneltarma, but she drowned before reaching the summit.\n\nAfter the destruction of Númenor, the surviving Númenóreans (led by descendents of Silmariën) founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-earth. At that point, cognatic primogeniture seems to have been abandoned; none of the rulers of Kings of Arnor or Kings of Gondor were women, and in the case of Anárion's children the youngest child Meneldil received the throne, as his older siblings were women. Queen Berúthiel of Gondor, although certainly formidable, was a Queen-consort, and therefore did not rule, at least officially.\n\nIn TA 1945, Arvedui of Arthedain\u2014who was married to Fíriel, daughter and only surviving child of King Ondoher\u2014invoked the old Númenórean law to claim that he (not his wife) should be granted the throne.

He travelled to Middle-earth in the Second Age with Rómestámo (Pallando), and they became the Ithryn Luin, or \"Blue Wizards\". They travelled to the east of Arda, to countries in far eastern Middle-earth such as Rhûn and Khand, where they were sent to stir up rebellions against those serving Sauron. In this, they were successful, and they later returned to Middle-earth in the Third Age and travelled East and South once again, but they never returned to the West after their journey with Saruman. It is possible that they became the founders of secret and magical cults, but their ultimate fate remains unknown.","Alatar was originally a Maia of Oromë the Huntsman named Mohrinehtar, and presumably lived in his forests on the continent of Aman, west of Middle-earth. The other servants of Oromë included Rómestámo (later Pallando), who was a friend of Morinehtar's, and whom he would later choose to journey with him. At some point in the Second Age, around the forging of the Rings of Power, Mohrinehtar and Rómestámo were chosen to become the first of the Istari, and were sent to the East of Middle-earth to stir up rebellion against Sauron and assist the few tribes of Men who had refused to worship Morgoth in the First Age.","During the Third Age, the Valar selected Mohrinehtar, renamed Alatar, meaning \"after-comer\", and Pallando to be two of the five Maiar to travel from the Undying Lands to Middle-earth and serve as Istari wizards. Alatar, Curumo (Saruman the White) and Olórin (Gandalf the Grey) were assigned the objective of encouraging the peoples of Middle-earth to oppose Sauron. However, two more joined the original three Wizards and they became five. Aiwendil (Radagast the Brown) was chosen by Yavanna to travel with Curumo, and Alatar took Pallando the Blue as a companion. Upon arrival in Middle-earth, Alatar and Pallando were dressed in robes of sea-blue. Due to this, they were called the Blue Wizards (or Ithryn Luin, in Sindarin). With Saruman, they travelled east in an attempt to help free the last Men of Númenor, who were now Haradrim and Easterlings. Later, Saruman came back to the west alone. However, Alatar and Pallando were never seen again, and their ultimate fate, and whether or not they failed their mission, is unknown.","Alatar probably means \"after-comer\" (as he was one of the original two Maiar to be chosen to become Wizards and follow Sauron to Middle Earth). J.R.R. Tolkien specifically stated that neither Alatar nor Pallando had a name in the West of Middle-earth, unlike the other three Wizards (who all had two names). Therefore, Tolkien probably intended \"Alatar\" to be more of a title or a description than a name. Later in his life, Tolkien wrote a note, suggesting that the names of the Blue Wizards were Morinehtar and Rómestámo. It is not clear whether these names were intended to replace the names Alatar and Pallando, or whether Morinehtar and Rómestámo were alternate names for the Blue Wizards, possibly those given to them by the peoples of Middle-earth.","When talking to Bilbo, Gandalf the Grey mentions the two Blue Wizards in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. When Bilbo asks how many Wizards there are, Gandalf states that there is him, Saruman, the two Blue Wizards (whose names he cannot remember), and Radagast the Brown.

Boldog drove his host south over the highlands of Dorthonion and the through enchanted forest of Taur-nu-Fuin following the Orcs' Road of Haste into the Pass of Anach. Where fell darkness met the mists of the magic, which were the Girdle of Melian, just east of the river Mindeb, the Orc-host reached the border of Doriath. To meet the deadly threat posed by Boldog's invasion in force, Thingol musters his full might with his two great Captains, Beleg and Mablung. He leads the army of Sindarin Elves beyond the North March of Doriath. Thingol and Boldog meet in single combat in the midst of the battle. Thingol wielded his Dwarf-forged sword, Aranrúth, Boldog fought with an iron spear of some note that was later used by Mablung in the Hunting of the Wolf. Thingol slays Boldog, the Orc-host is utterly defeated and the remnants destroyed by being driven into Taur-nu-Fuin.\n\nThe Battle of the Northmarch was the culminating battle of a series of attacks in Morgoth's campaign against Doriath, following his victories in the Dagor Bragollach (Battle of Sudden Flame), the fourth of the great Battles of Beleriand that broke the Siege of Angband.\n\nDetails of Boldog's raid are scattered through numerous versions of texts within The Lays of Beleriand, compiled by Christopher Tolkien - however, no aspect of the plot-lines involving Boldog are in serious contradiction with the \"final\" canon of Quenta Silmarillion. Boldog's independent command of a host of orcs with its formidable objectives indicates that he would have been several ranks above most other Orc-Captains and champions (such as Orcobal or Balcmeg, who both were from a different century), and it is thought elsewhere in the sources that Boldog was of some lesser order of the Maiar corrupted by Morgoth that took the form of an Orc, as opposed to previously being an Elf that became mutilated (which was the ancient origin of Orcs in general).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Boldog_(Character)"}}

To prevent such atrocity, Lhunurion and his kin were stationed on top of the Deeping Wall. He was standing behind Legolas and Gimli, looking onwards at the arrival of Saruman's army.

Mablung then attempted to stop Saeros from taking his threats too far and warned him of Túrin's strength, should he attempt to fight him. Aware that a fight had broken out between the two, Mablung was present at the final play in the drama and tried to stop things from ending badly. It was to no avail Saeros ran despairingly in fear and fell off a brink where a stream ran into the Esgalduin, and struck his head on a rock and died. Later, Mablung was present before Thingol's throne where he accounted for everything that had gone on between Saeros and Túrin, and later accounts of Túrin\u2019s choice to leave Doriath.\n\nMablung became captain of the guard of Doriath after Beleg left to seek Túrin. When Morwen Eledhwen, who dwelt in Doriath at the time, learned of the fall of Nargothrond and that her son Túrin might be there, she wished to seek him out. Mablung was assigned by Thingol to guard her on their way. Unknown to both Mablung and Morwen until too late, Nienor daughter of Morwen, had joined them. Mablung was unable to prevent them both from being ensnared in the traps of Glaurung, the dragon of Morgoth. Mablung hid from Glaurung and then searched the sacked Nargothrond, finding no sign of Túrin. \n\nNienor was found again by Mablung, in a trance, by the spell of Glaurung, at Amon Ethir. Mablung then led her back to Doriath, but he later lost her again when she ran off unclad started by a band of Orcs; a result of the spell of Glaurung. Thus she fled beyond the sight of Mablung. Unable to recover her Mablung returned to Doriath, but he spent years afterwards searching for Morwen and Nienor.\n\nMablung went to Brethil when he learned Glaurung was there, and there met Túrin. By admitting Nienor was lost he caused Túrin to realize that Níniel his wife had actually been his sister Nienor and Túrin killed himself.\n\nMablung was the last person to whom Melian spoke before departing Middle-earth.

In that conflict, King Narmacil II of Gondor was slain, as was Marhari. Marhwini then led a remnant of what remained of the Northmen to the vales of Anduin, where they mixed with fugitives escaped from the east. This was the beginning of the culture that would become the Rohirrim.\n\nDuring the reign of Calimehtar, King of Gondor, Marhwini sent word to Gondor that a host of Wainriders was preparing to assault the land of Calenardhon (later Rohan). Eager to avenge Gondor's prior defeat by the Wainriders, Calimehtar led an army out of Gondor and joined with Northmen under Marhwini. The combined force overwhelmed the Wainriders' army. As Marhwini had hoped, many thralls of the Wainriders who had once been among the Northmen revolted, and caused their captor's settlements to be destroyed. As the Wainriders retreated from battle, they were forced to return far to the east, having been defeated and driven from their homes.

Celeborn was said to be the grandson of Thingol's brother Elmo. Celeborn's father was Galadhon and he had a brother named Galathil.\n\nAround FA 52, Galadriel came to Doriath. Galadriel was one of the Ñoldor who came to Middle-earth wishing to see the lands and rule a realm of her own. She came with the second 'group' of elves from Aman with Fingolfin and Finrod. Celeborn and Galadriel fell in love and married each other.\n\nIt is not clear how long Celeborn and Galadriel dwelled in Beleriand. According to one story, they left Beleriand and crossed the Blue Mountains into Eriador before the Fall of Nargothrond in FA 495, but according to another story they remained in Beleriand until the end of the First Age.\n\nAround FA 502, King Thingol of Doriath summoned dwarf craftsmen to set a Silmaril in Nauglamir, the fabled jeweled Necklace of the Dwarves. The dwarf craftsmen coveted the necklace and especially the Silmaril, and they demanded that Thingol give it to them. When Thingol refused, they killed him and took the necklace set with the Silmaril. The Dwarven craftsmen were pursued by elves of Doriath, who killed the Dwarves and retrieved the necklace. However, two Dwarves escaped and returned to Nogrod in the Blue Mountains and rallied their kinsmen to seek vengeance on the Elves of Doriath. An army of Dwarves attacked Doriath and defeated the elves. They took the necklace once more, but Beren again reclaimed it.\n\nDoriath was briefly re-inhabited by Beren's son Dior Eluchíl, but the sons of Feanor came to try to take the Silmaril. Though Dior's daughter Elwing escaped with the Silmaril, Dior was killed and Doriath was ruined and abandoned.\n\nCeleborn's distrust of Dwarves began at this time. His role in these events is unknown, although in one account it is written that Celeborn escaped the sack of Doriath.\n\nThe First Age ended with the War of Wrath and the defeat of Morgoth. Beleriand was ruined and sank beneath the Sea. Many of the Ñoldor returned to the Undying Lands with the pardon of the Valar, but Galadriel remained in Middle-earth with Celeborn.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel probably lived for a time in Lindon, a coastal region west of the Blue Mountains. Gil-galad was the High King of the elves who dwelled in Lindon. However, many of the elves in Harlindon - the part of Lindon south of the Gulf of Lune - were Sindarin elves like Celeborn, and he may have ruled a fiefdom there under Gil-galad.\n\nAt some time early in the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel are said to have moved eastward into Eriador with a number of Elves in their following. They may have lived for a while near Lake Evendim. Their daughter Celebrian may have been born during this time. They began to move eastward again around the year SA 700 of the Second Age because Galadriel sensed a growing evil in Middle-earth that she felt duty-bound to oppose.\n\nThe realm of Eregion was founded in SA 750, and Galadriel and Celeborn are said to have dwelled there for a time along with Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths. The Elves of Eregion had dealings with the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm nearby, but Celeborn still distrusted Dwarves and would not enter Khazad-dûm, although the Dwarves there had nothing to do with the destruction of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves of Eregion also had contact with the Elves of Lothlórien on the other side of the Misty Mountains. According to one story, Galadriel went to dwell in Lothlórien around SA 1350 to SA 1400 while Celeborn remained in Eregion. However, in other versions of the story both Galadriel and Celeborn stayed in Eregion.\n\nSauron came to Eregion in a fair disguise as Annatar the \"Lord of gifts\" in SA 1200 and deceived the Elven-smiths, who began forging the Rings of Power under his instruction in SA 1500. Sauron forged the One Ring to rule the others around SA 1600, and Celebrimbor hid from him the Three Elven Rings of power that he had made without Sauron knowing of its creation and help. Enraged, Sauron attacked Eregion in SA 1697.\n\nCeleborn led a sortie from Eregion to meet the vanguard of Sauron's army. He was able to drive the enemy back long enough to join forces with Elrond, who brought reinforcements from Lindon. But Sauron's army was greater than their combined forces and Eregion soon fell. Celebrimbor was killed, and Sauron took the Nine Rings and at least six of the Seven rings. Sauron would eventually be driven back to Mordor in SA 1701.\n\nThe movements of Celeborn and Galadriel after the fall of Eregion are unclear. Celeborn may have gone to Lothlórien to help strengthen their defenses against Sauron. He and Galadriel may have lived there for a time, but they did not become the rulers of Lothlórien then. The king of Lothlórien at that time was Amdír, who was killed in the War of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age and was succeeded by his son Amroth.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel may also have lived for a while in Rivendell, the home of Elrond. At some point, they may have travelled to the coastal region of Belfalas in the south to be near the sea.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel's daughter Celebrian married Elrond in TA 109. Elrond and Celebrian had three children: twin sons Elladan and Elrohir, born in TA 130, and a daughter Arwen, born in TA 241.\n\nAround TA 1050, the Necromancer, who was actually Sauron, built the stronghold of Dol Guldur across the Anduin from Lothlórien. Celeborn and Galadriel are said to have returned to Lothlórien to investigate the Necromancer and ensure the safety of Lothlórien. But after a time, they once again departed, possibly for Rivendell. Lothlórien remained under the rule of King Amroth.\n\nA Balrog awoke in Khazad-dum in TA 1980. Many of the Elves of Lothlórien fled, including Amroth's lover Nimrodel. Amroth followed Nimrodel and he later perished at sea. Lothlórien was left without a leader, so Celeborn and Galadriel returned there and became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien in TA 1981. They dwelled on a flat in Caras Galadhon, the City of the Trees.\n\nCelebrian was on her way to Lothlórien to visit her parents in TA 2509 when she was captured by orcs in caradhras. Her sons Elladan and Elrohir rescued Celebrian, but the horror of the experience remained with her and she decided to leave Middle-earth the next year to dwell in the Undying Lands.\n\nIn TA 2941, Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur by the White Council - of which Galadriel was a member. However, Sauron had been prepared for the attack and returned to Mordor. He sent Nazgûl led by Khamul to occupy Dol Guldur.\n\nAragorn came to Lothlórien in TA 2980 and became betrothed to Arwen, who was there visiting her grandparents.\n\nIn December of 3018, Elladan and Elrohir brought word to Celeborn and Galadriel of the Fellowship's quest to destroy the One Ring. The Fellowship arrived in Lothlórien on January 15, 3019, and was brought to Caras Galadhon to meet Celeborn and Galadriel on January 17.\n\nCeleborn at first welcomed Gimli despite his distrust of Dwarves and said he hoped that there could be friendship between their peoples once more. Then he  learned that the Balrog had been disturbed by an expedition of Dwarves to Khazad-dum led by Balin several years before, and that the Balrog had attacked the Fellowship resulting in the loss of Gandalf the Grey. Celeborn was angry at first and regretted allowing the Fellowship to enter Lothlórien, but Galadriel soothed him and he apologized to Gimli.\n\nCeleborn promised to help the Fellowship in any way he could. On the eve of the Fellowship's departure from Lothlórien, he discussed what route they might take, and offered them boats to ease their journey down the Anduin. The next day on February 16, Celeborn and Galadriel prepared a feast for the Fellowship and gave them gifts. Celeborn gave them further advice about navigating the Great River.\n\nLothlórien was attacked thrice by forces from Dol Guldur during the War of the Ring: on March 11, 15, and 22. Each time, the Galadhrim led by Celeborn and Galadriel repelled them. After the destruction of the One Ring and Sauron's defeat, Celeborn led a force across the Anduin and captured Dol Guldur on March 28. The shadow was lifted from Mirkwood.\n\nOn April 6, Celeborn met Thranduil, the King of the Woodland Realm, in Mirkwood. They renamed the forest the Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil retained kingship of the northern part of the forest, while the center part was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen. Celeborn claimed the southern part of the forest below the Narrows to be part of Lothlórien. This region was named East Lórien.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel accompanied their granddaughter Arwen to Minas Tirith, where she wed Aragorn on Midyear's Day. Celeborn and Galadriel then travelled to Rohan and attended the funeral of the King Theoden. On the way home, they met with Treebeard at Isengard.\n\nWhen Celeborn and Galadriel parted from Aragorn, Celeborn said to his granddaughter's husband: \"Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other than mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!\"\n\nCeleborn may have been anticipating the day when his own wife would depart for the Undying Lands while he remained in Middle-earth. On September 13, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Redhorn Gate to return to Lothlórien.\n\nGaladriel left Middle-earth to return to the Undying Lands in 3021 at the end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Lothlórien, but after a few years he began to grow weary. He went to Rivendell to live with his grandsons Elladan and Elrohir for awhile in the early part of the Fourth Age. Eventually, Celeborn went to the Grey Havens and sailed for the Undying Lands where his wife and daughter dwelled. It is said that \"with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.\"\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Celeborn"}}

Cirion could not spare many men to defend this part of his realm, and in despair he sent several messengers to their old friends the Éothéod, a people living in the far north.\n\nOnly one man, Borondir, reached the Éothéod capital of Framsburg, and delivered his message to the king Eorl the Young.\n\nAfter not receiving any answer for a full year, in TA 2510 Cirion set out west through Anórien, to prevent the Balchoth from crossing the Anduin at the Undeeps and the Wold.\n\nThe army of Gondor was defeated and driven back across the river Limlight to the Field of Celebrant. In what was probably a coordinated attack, the orcs came out of the Hithaeglir (Misty Mountains), and assailed the flank from the west, driving the forces of Gondor towards the Anduin. All hope was lost, when unlooked for came the riders of Éothéod out of the North. Together the Éothéod and the army of Gondor defeated the Balchoth and orcs, driving them into the Wold.\n\nCirion was a wise man, and saw that he could use the Éothéod further. He told Eorl that he would leave Calenardhon in his care, and meet Eorl again in three months' time. Back at Minas Tirith, Cirion ordered some of his most trusted servants to go to the Firien Woods in Anórien, and in secret clear the way to the mountain of Amon Anwar at the Halifirien beacon.\n\nThree months later Cirion, his son Hallas, the Prince of Dol Amroth, and two others Councilors of Gondor set out for Calenardhon, and Cirion met with Eorl. They ascended Amon Anwar, and Cirion revealed the shrine to Elendil, built in secret at this mountain, as it formed the centre of the Gondor of old. At this secret place, he revealed his plan to give Calenardhon as a free gift to the Éothéod, so that there should be a perpetual friendship between the Éothéod and the people of Gondor. On the behalf of his people, Eorl accepted this deal, swearing the Oath of Eorl and becoming the first King of Rohan.\n\nCirion, died in the year TA 2567, at the age of 118 years old.

Horses came in many colors such as white, grey, brown, and black."],"name":"Horse","description":"The Mearas were a breed of wild horses in the north of Middle-earth in the J.R.R. Tolkien legendarium.\n\nHe was the grey\/white horse given to Legolas by the Riders of Rohan in The Two Towers. Arod originally belonged to a Rider of Rohan, but his master was slain in a battle with orcs near Fangorn Forest on the night of February 28, 3019. The next day, Éomer lent Arod to Legolas and another horse named Hasufel to Aragorn on the condition that they later bring the horses to Meduseld.\n\nArod was a fiery and restive horse, but Legolas rode him easily without saddle or rein. Gimli was not so comfortable on Arod, however; and he clung to his friend uneasily. The Three Hunters rode the edge of Fangorn Forest seeking Merry and Pippin. During the night, a strange old man appeared at their campsite and then disappeared. Arod and Hasufel dragged their pickets and ran away. They heard Shadowfax, the lord of horses, and ran to greet him. The next day when Gandalf whistled to call Shadowfax, Arod and Hasufel returned as well.\n\nLegolas rode Arod to Meduseld and on to Helm's Deep. When Aragorn decided to take the Paths of the Dead, Legolas went with him, but Arod was reluctant to enter trembled in fear until Legolas laid his hands on the horse's eyes and sang to him. Arod then followed Legolas through the tunnels as the Dead gathered behind them.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Legolas and Gimli rode Arod in the funeral procession of King Théoden from Minas Tirith to Meduseld.\n\nArod means \"swift\" in the Old English language.\n\nTrivia Arod who is played by a Percheron horse called Percy, now lives in retirement near Christchurch, NZ, owned by the Maillard family.\n\nThe Horse of Húrin.\n\nAsfaloth was the horse of Glorfindel. He was a white horse whose pace was light and smooth but swift. Glorfindel rode Asfaloth using a saddle with stirrups and a headstall studded with jewels.\n\nOn October 9, 3018, Glorfindel left Rivendell riding Asfaloth in search of Frodo Baggins. The Elf-lord rode his horse down the Great East Road to the Last Bridge, where they encountered three Ringwraiths. They pursued the Ringwraiths westward and encountered two more before returning to pick up Frodo's trail. On October 18, they caught up to the hobbits and Aragorn, and Glorfindel set the wounded Frodo upon Asfaloth.\n\nAs they approached the Ford of Bruinen on October 20, the Ringwraiths appeared. Asfaloth leaped forward, but Frodo reined the horse in, feeling a strange reluctance to flee. Then Glorfindel called out, \"Noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!\" and the horse ran swiftly down the Road, outpacing the steeds of the Ringwraiths. Asfaloth passed right in front of one of the Black Riders and then plunged into the waters of the Bruinen, carrying Frodo across the Ford to the edge of Rivendell.\n\nTrivia\n\nBill is bought by Frodo Baggins and his companions in Bree, as they fled the Shire on their way to Rivendell. This was necessary as their own ponies had been stolen from the stables of The Prancing Pony inn, where they spent the night. Bill was purchased from Bill Ferny, who was in league with the spies who stole the other ponies. Ferny was a cruel man who tormented Bill, but after being purchased by the hobbits Bill became a much happier pony. He was given the name 'Bill' by Sam Gamgee shortly after the party left Bree.\n\nAfter arriving in Rivendell, Bill became acquainted with the elvish horses, and this influence resulted in a good deal of self-improvement. He left Rivendell a much wiser pony, not to mention healthier and happier.\n\nHe accompanied the Fellowship of the Ring from Rivendell to the doors of Moria, but had to be left behind there because the company could not take a pony through the mines of Moria. All thought him killed by either the Watcher in the Water or wolves, but being a wise pony by this point, he managed to survive on his own and travelled back to Bree. There, he was nursed back to health at The Prancing Pony, until he eventually was joyfully reunited with Sam on his return journey to the Shire. Sam apparently took Bill back to Hobbiton for the rest of his life.\n\nIn the trilogy of film adaptations of the Lord of the Rings by Peter Jackson, Bill only appears in The Fellowship of the Ring. Originally, a treatment in line with the books was going to be used: Bill would be presumed to have been killed by the Watcher in the Water, but then re-appear alive as a surprise at the end of The Return of the King. However, several producers objected to this because The Return of the King film adaptation would be released two years after The Fellowship of the Ring, and they didn't want the audience to be horrified and for two full years think that Bill had gruesomely died. As a result, in the final version Bill is seen being peacefully released from the Fellowship outside Moria, a significant amount of time before the Watcher in the Water attacks, with the implication that he will find his way home. Although this is the only time Bill the pony expressly appears in the films, Sam is riding a pony back into Hobbiton at the end of The Return of the King, and it could presumably be Bill.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's movie version of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Aragorn rides a horse named Brego, apparently named after a king of the same name. The horse once belonged to Éowyn's cousin, but during the war of the ring, the people of Rohan considered the horse half-mad. Aragorn however was able to calm him and had him set free saying that the horse had seen enough of war. Later after falling off a cliff after fighting Wargs, Brego came to Aragorn who used him as a mount from that point on.\n\nBumpkin was one of the five ponies that Merry Brandybuck had ready at Crickhollow for the hobbits to use on their journey. When they set out on September 26, 3018, each hobbit rode a pony while fifth carried their extra baggage.\n\nAt the house of Tom Bombadil, the ponies got to know Tom's pony Fatty Lumpkin, and when the ponies became frightened in the fog on the Barrow-downs, they ran off to find their friend. Tom called the ponies by names he had given them - Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail, Bumpkin, and White-socks - and they returned to the hobbits still bearing their burdens.\n\nAt The Prancing Pony in Bree, the ponies were let out of the stables in an attempt to delay the hobbits' departure. The five ponies ran off to the Barrow-downs in search of Fatty Lumpkin. They stayed with Tom Bombadil for a while, but when Tom learned what had happened, he sent the ponies to Barliman Butterbur. The ponies remained in Bree, where they worked hard but were well cared for by Bob.\n\nFatty Lumpkin is the pony that is ridden by Tom Bombadil. In The Fellowship of the Ring, the hobbits' (Sam, Merry, Pippin and Frodo) own ponies get to know Fatty Lumpkin and manage to find him after the hobbits encounter a fog on the Barrow Downs. Although he belongs to Tom, he seldom rode him and was often left to wander free in the wilderness.\n\nFirefoot was a horse of Rohan, and he bore Éomer and Gimli from Edoras to Helm's Deep prior to the Battle of the Hornburg.\n\nHe was described as being as intelligent as any human, could understand the speech of men, and was the first of the Mearas.\n\nFelaróf was a wild foal when he was captured by Eorl the Young's father Léod, a tamer of horses. Despite no one being able to tame it, Léod attempted to mount it, but was killed when the stallion threw him.\n\nEorl vowed to avenge his father, but did not slay it, naming it Felaróf and commanding the horse to serve him. Eorl rode him without bit or bridle. They took part in the battle of the Field of Celebrant.\n\nThis Horse-shaped Water washed out the Nazgûl horses in Bruinen.\n\nHasufel was one of the horses given to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli by Éomer when his company encountered them pursuing the Uruk-hai.\n\nNahar (from the Valarin Naechaerra) was the horse of the Vala Oromë. It was the neighing of Nahar that alerted Oromë to the presence of the Quendi when he came upon them for the first time.\n\nThe mighty horse of Fingolfin, High King of the Ñoldor. Rochallor bore the King to the gates of Angband, where a desperate and fearless Fingolfin challenged Morgoth to single combat.\n\nThe name means 'horse of the lady' in Sindarin; this stems from the horse being gifted to Aragorn by his lady-love, Arwen.\n\nRoheryn was brought to Aragorn in the South by his kinsman Halbarad during the War of the Ring, prior to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nShadowfax is a mighty horse of Rohan, the chief of the Mearas, tamed by Gandalf and reluctantly granted as a gift to him (after Gandalf had borrowed him for some time) by King Théoden of the Rohirrim. No Man could tame Shadowfax. He would not tolerate a bridle or saddle, and only carried Gandalf by choice. The great horse also bore a hobbit, Pippin, as well as the dwarf Gimli for a short time during the War of the Ring.\n\nLike the other Mearas, Shadowfax was a grey\/silver stallion, and could understand the speech of Men. He was also seemingly fearless, and could run faster than any other horse in Middle-Earth. In an unpublished epilogue and letters Tolkien stated that Shadowfax passed to Valinor over the sea with Gandalf, but in The Lord of the Rings itself this is only hinted at by mention of Gandalf standing near a \"great grey horse\" on the quay just before departing. In the film adaptations of The Two Towers and The Return of the King, Shadowfax is portrayed by two grey horses of the Andalusian breed. (Almost all horses that appear white are in fact grays, including all the \"white\" horses in the LotR movies.)\n\nSnowmane, foal of Lightfoot, was the mount of King Théoden, on which he rode into the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. He was certainly weaker than Shadowfax, who was claimed by Gandalf; however, since his master was the King of Rohan he was most likely one of the Mearas himself.\n\nSnowmane accompanied Théoden to the Battle of the Hornburg, and was ridden on the final charge out of the fortress. At the battle of the Pelennor, however, Snowmane was pierced by a black dart, causing him to fall and crush Théoden beneath him. He was buried with honour on the field of battle; his grave, known as Snowmane's Howe, bore the inscription:\n\nStybba is the pony given by Théoden to Merry Brandybuck. He is described as small, shaggy, and grey. Theoden's reason for leaving Merry in Edoras while he rides to Gondor to do battle is that Stybba cannot keep up with the horses of the Rohirrim, and none of the riders can carry Merry. The name is from Old English styb \"stub, stump\".

After spending hundreds of years lying dormant and slowly regaining his strength, Sauron returned to power in the Third Age, but was finally defeated in the War of the Ring through the destruction of the One Ring by Frodo Baggins.","Sauron was originally a Maia of Aulë the Smith, named Mairon, meaning \"the admirable\", and learned much from him in the ways of forging and crafting, becoming a great craftsman, and mighty in the lore of Aulë's people. Although he was a Maia spirit, and not as mighty as the Valar, Mairon was one of the most powerful Maiar, being far stronger than others such as Olorin and Curumo (who was also a servant of Aulë).","When Morgoth left Angband to corrupt the newly awakened Atani (Men), Sauron directed the war against the Elves. He conquered the Elvish isle of Tol Sirion, so that it became known as Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of Werewolves. He was the Lord of the Werewolves there, and Draugluin was the sire of the Werewolves. Sauron's herald was the vampire Thuringwethil.","Although Sauron knew that men were easier to sway, he sought to bring the Elves into his service, as they were far more powerful. By about SA 1500, Sauron put on a fair visage in the Second Age, and calling himself Annatar, the \"Lord of Gifts\", he befriended the Elvish smiths of Eregion, including Celebrindor, greatest of craftsman as he was descended from Fëanor, and counseled them in arts and magic. Not all the Elves trusted him, particularly Lady Galadriel, Elrond, and Gil-galad, High King of the Ñoldor.","These Men lived on the island of Númenor in the sea between Middle-earth and Valinor. The Númenóreans, who were then proud, came to Middle-earth with astounding force of arms. King Ar-Pharazôn, who desired no less than the kingship of Middle-earth, marched his troops all the way to Mordor without a single battle, and demanded that Sauron abase himself before the King. Sauron could see clearly that even the most powerful of his servants could not stand against the Númenóreans, and so came from Barad-dûr without any offer of battle. He assumed a fair form and flattered Ar-Pharazôn, but the King demanded that Sauron come back to Númenor as a hostage. Sauron feigned unhappiness at this development but secretly was delighted, for this presented him with an opportunity to destroy the Númenóreans from within. After only a few short years in Númenor he grew from captive to the King's most trusted adviser, and nearly all the King's court fawned upon him. Drawing on their fear of death, he converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Morgoth, lying that Morgoth had the power to save them from mortality. As his power and influence reached its peak, he raised a great Temple in which he performed human sacrifices to Morgoth. Finally, he convinced Ar-Pharazôn to rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself and claim it for himself.","But while Isildur had taken the ring, he could not bring himself to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged, instead he became corrupted by the One Ring and kept it for himself. He was eventually betrayed by it a few years later, and slain by Orcs at Gladden Fields. The Ring fell into the river Anduin, and was lost for centuries before being found by the two Stoorish friends Smeagol and Déagol.","Despite his defeat, Sauron was not vanquished permanently. Though greatly weakened, and in non-corporeal form, he still existed, due to pouring most of his native power, strength, and will into the One Ring. Thus, as long as it existed, he could never be truly defeated, and during the first thousand years of the Third Age, he lay in hiding, slowly recovering his strength until he was once again able to create a body for himself.","While Sauron continued to gather his strength, the Ringwraiths reappeared in the year TA 1300, and began steadily assaulting the Numenorian kingdoms in exile until, one by one, they fell. Whether the Witch King was acting on his own, or was being guided by Sauron, is not known.","Meanwhile, Sauron had allied with Saruman the White (another fallen Maia, or Istari), whom he had ensnared into his service, expecting the wizard to move against Rohan and thus remove one of the major threats Sauron faced in his planned conquest of Gondor and the remaining Elves. Saruman failed however, and Sauron lost his most potent ally as well as Saruman's massive orc army of Uruk-hai.","With his source of power gone, Sauron was utterly defeated and his armies were destroyed or scattered, bereft of the driving will behind their conquest. With the Ring's destruction, Sauron was permanently robbed of his physical form, reducing him to a malevolent spirit that hovered above Mordor as a \"huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, ...terrible but impotent,\" only to be blown away by a great wind.","Sauron is the Quenya term for \"the Abhorred\". In Sindarin, it is translated as Gorthaur from gor (\"horror, dread\") and thaur (\"abominable, abhorrent\").","His original name was said to be Mairon (\"the Admirable\", from maira meaning \"admirable, excellent\"), a name he used while in Númenor, adding the title \"Tar\" for \"Tar-Mairon\" (\"King Excellent\"). When disguising himself in the Second Age, he called himself Annatar (\"Lord of Gifts, anna = gift and tar = king, lord\"), Artano (\"High-smith\"), and Aulendil (\"Friend of Aulë\").","Thû was Tolkien's earliest name for Sauron, in the original Lay of Leithian. Thu is reintroduced as an alternate name for Sauron in Beren and Luthien (2017).","The extent, nature, and specifics of Sauron's power are largely left to the imagination. Like his master Morgoth, he was capable of altering the physical substance of the world around him by mere effort of will.","The Symbol of Sauron was the Eye of Sauron, particularly after he arose in Mirkwood at Dol Guldur. The Evil Eye is also the most popular representation of Sauron, though it is but a representation of his will and semi-omniscient. It is known as The Eye of Sauron in The Silmarillion, and in The Lord of the Rings is also known as the Great Eye, the Eye of Barad-dûr, the Red Eye, the Lidless Eye, and the Evil Eye. The term Red Eye is also used to refer to the actual Eye of Sauron.","Beren and Luthien (2017) reintroduces some of the ideas from the Book of Lost Tales into the complete tale of Beren and Luthien, however Tevildo is introduced as a separate character to Thu\/Sauron in its adaptation of the story.","Prior to the publication of The Silmarillion, Sauron's origins and true identity were unclear to those without full access to Tolkien's notes, so that early editions of the Guide to Middle-earth described Sauron as \"probably of the Eldar elves\".","\"There is no life in the void, only death.\"","In the The Desolation of Smaug, Sauron reveals a greater extent of his powers. When Gandalf arrives in Dol Guldur to investigate tales of an evil there, Sauron first confronts him as a mass of black smoke. After a brief duel, Sauron is able to overpower the wizard and reveals himself as an armored figure within the shape of an enormous, flaming eye.","Sauron also appears or is referenced in a number of works that are not direct adaptations of The Lord of the Rings or it's associated mythos:"],"name":"Sauron","description":"Despite being the title character of The Lord of the Rings, Sauron is notable in that he never directly appears during the events of the trilogy. Nowhere is any detailed description given of what he looks like, other than in vague terms.\n\nIn The Silmarillion, however, Sauron is described as being a shape changer, and took many forms, including that of a serpent, a vampire, and a great wolf. After Morgoth's fall, Sauron appeared in fair form as \"Annatar\", the Lord of Gifts, and maintained this appearance until the Fall of Númenor, in which he was unable to ever take fair form ever again. The History of Middle-earth includes a passage vaguely describing how the Númenoreans saw him: \"Upon that ship which was cast highest and stood dry upon a hill there was a man, but greater than any even of the race of Numenor in stature...And it seemed to men that Sauron was great; though they feared the light of his eyes. To many he appeared fair, to others terrible; but to some evil.\"\n A few clues are given as to Sauron's appearance as the Dark Lord, after he lost his ability to take a fair form: Tolkien described Sauron in one of his letters as having the form of a man of more than human stature, but not gigantic, and as an image of malice and hatred made visible. He apparently gave off great heat, so much so that Gil-galad was burned to death by his mere touch, and Isildur described Sauron's hand as black, yet burning like fire, suggesting that his entire body was blackened from fire and heat.\n\nGollum, having apparently seen Sauron directly, described him as having only four fingers on his black hand, suggesting that Sauron was unable to regenerate the finger from which Isildur took the One Ring, similar to how the wounds Morgoth took from Fingolfin never healed.\n\nIn addition to his physical appearance, Sauron also apparently had an aura of incredible malevolence. A passage in The Silmarillion describes him as having a \"dreadful presence,\" and daunting eyes. Furthermore, his mere presence could bend all but the strongest wills.\n\nRegarding Sauron's personality, Tolkien had this to say from his letters: Philosopher and Tolkien scholar Peter J. Kreeft proposes that Sauron is in fact the main character of The Lord of the Rings, inasmuch as he has the largest significance to the work of good and evil in the story, given his shared essence with the Ring.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sauron"}}

Ancalagon and his armada of winged fire-drakes by themselves drove back the Host of the Valar during the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, such was their incredible power.\n\nFire-drakes also joined the Balrogs in the attack on Gondolin.\n\nAll fire-drakes were thought to have been slain before the Second Age, but some including Smaug the Golden survived; and in TA 2770,he descended from the North and sacked the Lonely Mountain. Later, in TA 2941 Thrór's grandson Thorin Oakenshield returned with a small group to reclaim his grandfather's kingdom, unleashing a chain of events that led to the death of Smaug when he attacked nearby Lake-town and was slain by the Black Arrow shot by Bard the Bowman.\n\nAccording to Gandalf, there were still fire-drakes just before the beginning of War of the Ring.\n\nThese creatures are described by Tolkien as being more like giant scaled serpents with wings than dragons as commonly depicted today. Fire-drakes often grew to immense size. The fire from one of these dragons was so intense that it was said the great dragons could consume and melt the Rings of Power (as became the case with some of hte Dwarven Rings), with the exception of the One Ring. Most of the famous dragons throughout the ages were fire-drakes, although only some of them fought for Morgoth.\n\nIn Quenya, fire-drakes were called Urulóki (\"Fire Serpent\" or \"Fire-dragon\"), from ur (\"heat\") and lókë (\"snake, serpent\").\n\nFew fire-drakes were named in J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium:\n\nTolkien confirmed in a letter that Smaug was the last of his kind, the last of the \"great\" fire-drakes of Middle-earth. Dragons of lesser stature, such as smaller kin of Cold-drakes and fire-drakes lived on. This was also mentioned by Gandalf.\n\nIn The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Thranduil had claimed to face a \"fire drake of the North\", and presumably suffered damages caused by dragon's fire.

A contingent of Goblins and Ringwraiths were sent to bring him over to Sauron's side, but the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain and the Men of Dale were able to kill him. However, this is non-canon.\n\nThe fire-drake is a drake that destroys the enemies in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II. This drake has large horns, sharp fangs, frightening eyes large legs\/arms, spiny back and long tail but no wings at all. They all breathe huge flames and are used with the Goblins with a dragon's nest, an upgrade for the goblin's base or sometimes summoned by Gorkil the Goblin King as his final power.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: War in the North: Urgost a winged fire drake who lives in the Grey Mountains.

He was a ruler of Eregion in the Second Age, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his creation of the three greatest Elven Rings of Power: Vilya, Narya, and Nenya.","Celebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Fëanor (son of Finwë and his first wife Miriel) and Nerdanel. During the First Age, he lived with his father in Nargothrond, but took no part in the deeds of Curufin and Celegorm regarding Lúthien, Beren, and Finrod. He in fact repudiated his father's deeds, and did not follow his father and uncle when they were expelled from Nargothrond.","In secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence over those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers, the elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water, respectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in Lórien.","His father-name was Telperinquar, which means \"Silver-fist\" or \"Hand of silver\" in Quenya. It comes from the words telpë (\"silver\") and quár (\"fist\"). His mother-name remains unknown. The name Celebrimbor is the Sindarin translation of his father-name, which comes from celeb (\"silver\") and baur (\"fist\").","Later, Celebrimbor was changed and became of Ñoldorin origin, and a survivor of the Fall of Gondolin. In the Unfinished Tales, a statement claims Celebrimbor to be one of the Teleri who accompanied Celeborn to exile.","After the illusions are eliminated, Talion hears his wife Ioreth singing, and when he gets close to her, his wife is revealed as the Tower, who attempts to stab him with a Morgul dagger. However, Talion overpowers him and brutally kills him, stabbing him with his son's dagger four times in the heart, before shoving his sword into the Tower's decaying mouth (both optionally reforged by Celebrimbor). After the Tower's death, Talion reveals his anger at Celebrimbor for his deceit, saying he wanted to be with his wife and son instead of being alone alive. Celebrimbor points out that he wanted revenge, and thus he gave him the means to do so. The Ringmaker refuses to let Talion depart until they have both exacted vengeance on their true target: the Black Hand.

He was described to have an \"almost Dwarvish obsession with crafts\"; he became a famous artificer and smith in both Gondolin and Eregion. His love for crafts took him to Eregion, where he was introduced to a precious metal and called it Mithril. Mithril was mined by Dwarves in their nearby Mine Realm of Khazad-dum, later renamed Moria. Great friendship with the Dwarves of Moria developed, skills and secrets were shared between the two peoples for many years via The High Road which was built between the two realms.

But once the Eagles arrived, the remaining trolls either fled into the Were -Worm tunnels, or were eventually taken down by the combined allied forces.\n\nHeavily armored in thick plates of steel, these trolls were more than a match for the allied armies during the battle of the five armies. They were about 9-12 feet tall at most, being the smaller trolls on the battlefield. Their only weapons were wooden clubs fitted with iron spikes, of which was to be used on the iron hill dwarves, and mirkwood elves.\n\nThese trolls were various sizes and more importantly they were armoured like the Guldur Orc's. They were either about the size of a regular troll in the films or an Ogre. These trolls were fearsome weapons on the field and devastated dozens of soldiers with one strike alone of their weapons.\n\nThese trolls were quite intelligent and kept formation with the orcs as they marched to battle, in battle these trolls carried bladed axe\/sword like weapons upon their arms, (similar to the Guldur Orcs's shields) long metal maces which could smash the very earth several feet into the air, taking down several men at once. Some even used their bare hands, balling them up into fists to smash the allied armies, or sweeping them up and throwing them like rag-dolls. Others used spiky clubs.\n\nThese trolls so far have only seen action in the Peter Jackson's film adaptation of the Battle of the Five armies, and seen during the later portion of the battle, preparing to charge at a surrounded portion of Dain's army at the gate of Erebor. Six of these trolls were put to the front lines to attack, when Thorin Oakenshield rallied the dwarves and regained their morale, four of these trolls were killed by heavy spears, being lodged directly into their necks, killing them. (However it is also possible these trolls have been fighting previously and were wounded by attacks from before)\n\nThe remaining trolls held their ground and smashed into the Dwarven lines. Later on these trolls were reinforced by the much larger trolls, and bats of Gundabad.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Guldur_Olog-Hai"}}

Through their mother Celebrían, they are the only grandsons of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of Lothlórien.","When the Fellowship arrived in Rivendell, the twin's role was to scout the lands and prepare the way for the Fellowship. Later, they traveled along with Halbarad and the Grey Company. They delivered a message from their father concerning the Paths of the Dead and followed Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli there. Elladan traveled behind the company, the Dead following after him. They battled in the Fields of Pelennor \"with stars bound to their brows.\"","After the war, Elladan and Elrohir met the escort of Arwen in Lothlorien, and together, they travel to Edoras. The brothers arrived first and carried a banner of silver. They were followed by Glorfindel and Erestor.","When their father departed to the West, the brothers stayed in Rivendell. In time, their grandfather Celeborn came to live with them for a short time before passing into the Grey Havens. Elladan and Elrohir remained in Rivendell even after this, and so Rivendell was the only Elven settlement left in Middle-earth at the beginning of the Fourth Age. They went over Sea with the other inhabitants of Rivendell, and so became the last Eldar to pass into the West.","The name Elladan is Sindarin for \"Elf-Man\" or \"Elf-Dúnadan,\" referring to his dual descent from both Elves and Edain (a house of Men from Beleriand). It comes from the words el (\"elf or star\") and adan, singular of Edain. On the other hand, Elrohir means \"Elf-knight\", but rochir also means \"horse-lord\".","The marriages between Elves and Men are in bold.\n The half-elven or the Peredhil are in italic.","In early writings, Elladan and Elrohir were named \"Elboron and Elbereth.\" These were the same early names for the twins Eluréd and Elurín, who were the uncles of Elrond. They also had a younger sister named Finduilas, who was later renamed Arwen. In this version, Elladan and Elrohir's birth date was TA 2349.","Elladan and Elrohir also appear in the fan-made film, Born of Hope and were played by the twin brother actors Sam Kennard and Matt Kennard.","They also appeared in the Lord of the Rings: War in the North video game.

Secondly, one is rarely mentioned without the other, and their names are only separated when they are speaking. Thirdly, they were both born in the same year, and elven pregnancies last a full year.  Fourthly, the birth of twins was not a rare occurrence in their family history (Amrod and Amras, Eluréd and Elurín, Elrond and Elros).\n\nThe brethren were friends and companions-in-arms of the Rangers of the North, and helped defend the remnants of Arnor from evil after the fall of the northern kingdom. They held a special grudge against orcs because of their mother's suffering at their hands.\n\nLike their sister, father, and uncle, they could make a choice between mortality and immortality, expressed by whether they would follow their father to Valinor at the time of his own departure at the end of the Third Age. Since they are explicitly described as remaining in Rivendell for a time after their father's departure, some fans speculated that they had also chosen mortality. However, J.R.R. Tolkien himself noted that the twins were allowed to \"delay\" their choices.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Elladan_and_Elrohir"}}

Thus, he is one of the first characters Tolkien ever created."],"name":"Ecthelion of the Fountain","description":"Two hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and Egalmoth, along with the White Lady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City due to Aredhel's yearning for the freedom she once had in Valinor. Their orders were to lead her towards Hithlum, where she would meet her elder brother Fingon. When coming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Aredhel ordered them to turn south, for she desired to see the Sons of Fëanor. Thus, Ecthelion and his companions sought admittance to Doriath, but the wardens refused them entrance inside the Girdle of Melian. Having no other choice, they took the dangerous road between the haunted valleys of Ered Gorgoroth. Near Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, the riders were caught in a mesh of shadows and they were lost from Aredhel. In vain, they sought her afterwards, but the fell offspring of Ungoliant that dwelt in that place pursued them. Barely escaping alive, the three lords returned to Gondolin without the princess, where they were received in sorrow.\n\nIn the year, FA 473 Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon in the battle Nirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Gondolin's forces. Upon the defeat of the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.\n\nTwenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë of Gondolin traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil through the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them as Warden of the Great Gate.\n\nEcthelion initially denied passage for Tuor but when Tuor made a reference towards Ulmo, the Lord of the Waters, Ecthelion eventually allowed him entry.\n\nHe was the leader of the House of the Fountain, one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim. His people were fond of diamonds and silver, their array was most beautiful to the sight. In FA 510 during the Fall of Gondolin, Ecthelion led his house into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.\n\nIn the battle over Gondolin, Ecthelion and his forces made their entrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in reserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the swords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror among the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by side with Tuor and his House of the Wing, they drove away the orcs until almost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced Morgoth's army, Ecthelion killed three Balrogs and his sword did \"hurt to their fire\". Outnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm was wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they joined the remaining leaders in the Square of the King.\n\nIn that place, the great Fountain of the King stood and Ecthelion regained his strength by drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the enemy's forces towards the Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began retreat. All but Ecthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand, which was remembered as the most valiant \"in all the songs or in any tale\". It was there that he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs.\n\nTuor tried to stand in the way of Gothmog, but he was thrown aside. Then Ecthelion, fairest of the Ñoldor, but whose face now had the pallor of grey steel, dueled him. Losing his sword due to a wound received he was unable to protect himself. Just as Gothmog was about to deliver the finishing blow, Ecthelion jumped and wrapped his legs around the demon, driving the spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. This caused Gothmog to lose his balance, and he, along with Ecthelion, fell into the Fountain of the King. Gothmog's fire was thus quenched, but Ecthelion also drowned with him and found his death in cool waters, whose lord he was.\n\nLater, a young Eärendil asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion were there, \"to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles! Perchance has he gone on ahead?\" After he was informed of Ecthelion's death, he \"wept bitterly\" and said that he cared no more to see the streets of Gondolin.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ecthelion_of_the_Fountain"}}

The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by Orcs, the Vala Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Dimbar. There two Eagles picked them up, and brought them to Gondolin.\n\nKing Turgon of Gondolin welcomed the brothers, remembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aide Gondolin in their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin.

He never entered into the deeps of the seas as did his master but was instead fond of wildness and unpredictability of tides along the coastlines of the lands. Uinen was his wife, and he was a friend of Círdan the Shipwright. Ossë was a friend of the Teleri and Sindar of Middle-earth, and was valued as high as the Valar by them. During the shaping of Arda, Ossë was swayed into entering the service of Melkor who offered him the powers of Ulmo and played on his wild and sometimes violent desires. Thus, the seas suffered from wanton storms which came unto the lands bringing great ruin to them. He was persuaded to stop by Uinen under Aulë's bidding, but his taste for violence never really disappeared. The other Valar still loved him but did not completely trust him.\n\nOssë also obstructed the work by Ulmo and Uin the great whale by dragging back the island of Tol Eressëa westward which Uin (or with Ulmo and possibly other animals as well) carried to Aman. During the process, the portion of the original island fallen off settled and later became the Isle of Balar.\n\nWhen Fëanor and his people perpetrated the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Ossë, who loved the Teleri deeply, was devastated, but was forbidden by the Valar from intervening in the battle. However, after the Ñoldor had completed the massacre and stolen the ships of the Teleri, he conjured terrible storms to waylay the Ñoldor, causing the sinking many of the ships. Ossë was responsible for the raising of the island that would be called Númenor. When Ossë grew restless in the Second Age, the mariners of Númenor would call for help from Uinen to quiet his storms.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Oss%C3%AB"}}

Despite his loyalty with the Great Goblin, he secretly despised him.\n\nIn TA 2941, when Thorin and Company fell into Goblin-Town, Grinnah, along with a large group of Goblins captured them, took their weapons, and took the Dwarves to their master. Like the other Goblins, he too was offended when Balin cried out to their king that his song was an abomination. He told the Great Goblin about the Company's identification and where his group had found them, and was ordered to search their belongings as well as crushing Óin's trumpet in the process. Grinnah, during the search was surprised to find Elven objects in Nori's bag and suggested to his king that the Company had been in league with Elves (which were objects that Nori had stolen back in Rivendell).\n\nWhilst the Orcs continued searching and the Great Goblin singing the town's torture song, Grinnah found Orcrist, wondering what sword it was, and when he opened the holster, he screamed and threw the sword aside causing the other Orcs including the Great Orc to cower over the weapon and attempt to murder the Company. When Gandalf arrives to rescue the Dwarves and they take up arms to fight their way out, Grinnah fought against Kíli, but the young Dwarf impaled him through the stomach.\n\nGrinnah revealed in every chance he would get to use his whip on the victims of Goblin-town. Although cunning and vicious, he was, like many Orcs, a coward at heart. As well as he was obsequious and fawning, he secretly loathed his master, the Great Goblin even though he payed respect and loyalty to him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/lotr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Grinnah"}}
