Mrs. Norris viewed Fanny more as a servant than her niece and even had her do manual labor when it was hot out. Mrs. Norris's dismissive attitudes toward Fanny annoyed and shocked Edmund Bertram.","Like her female cousins, Fanny was awestruck of Miss Crawford's beauty and thought her a very genial young woman. She did think Miss Crawford was being ungrateful towards her uncle, who took her in."],"name":"Fanny Price","description":"Fanny is the second of ten children. Her parents were not very well off and having ten children was hard for them. This forced her mother to reconcile with her two sisters, Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris, after they had been estranged for nearly eleven years in order to ask for help. Her uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, a wealthy baronet, offered career advice for Fanny's brothers, and Lady Bertram sent monetary aid. The real help was conceived by her Aunt Norris, who suggested that they invite Fanny to Mansfield so that she could receive an education and relieve her parents of some burdens. Her mother was surprised because she thought the sons would be more sought after, but acquiesced and was pleased. Sir Thomas did leave the caveat that they would send Fanny home if she proved too vulgar to train.\n\nShe arrived at Mansfield when she was 10 years old. She was awed by the splendor of the estate and her relatives. She began a friendship with her 16 year old cousin Edmund after the boy had found her crying of homesickness. He offered to help her write and post a letter to her elder brother William, whom she dearly missed. She was not considered bright by her female cousins, who talked about her ignorance. She soon rose above that and proved to be teachable, pleasing her uncle. She shared a governess with her female cousins, a Miss Lee.\n\nUncle Norris died when Fanny was 15 years of age, leaving Aunt Norris a widow. She was apprehensive and saddened when her aunt Bertram told her that she was sending her to live as a companion for Aunt Norris, whom she didn't really like. It turned out that Mrs. Norris did not want a companion nor did she want her young niece to stay with her, and instead concerned herself with the Bertram girls. Her uncle, Sir Thomas, left for Antigua with his eldest son. Fanny became Lady Bertram's companion, especially when her cousins were out and enjoying the small society of their village. She had no share in the festivities and instead spent each function reading, listening, and talking with Aunt Bertram. She lived vicariously through her cousin Edmund, who told her about the functions.\n\nShe became disheartened when her grey pony died, leaving her without a horse. Her aunts neglected to get her a new mount, instead saying that the Miss Bertrams could lend her one of their horses if they were not using them. As they never did sacrifice their pleasure for their cousin, Fanny was stranded. Her only real champion in this case was Edmund, who said she definitely would need a horse.\n\nUpon the dual arrivals of Mary Crawford and her brother Henry, Fanny was in a semi-awkward position. She was quiet and rarely attended social functions, which confused Mary. Fanny thought Miss Crawford was very beautiful, but continued to think Henry was rather plain. Mary deduced that since Fanny never attended balls and hardly ever spoke in public, that the other young woman was indeed \"not out\".\n\nFanny was dismayed when Edmund went riding with Mary Crawford and other young people instead of with her. He restarted their daily rides when he learned the mistreatment she got from her aunts while he was away. Due to Edmund's kindness, she was also able to go on an outing to Sotherton Court. She was slightly disappointed in Sotherton and voiced her opinion in a low voice to Edmund.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fanny_Price"}}

She, however, kept her affection for Anne after this, while Sir Walter did not, believing that Anne would try to degrade their family with an unsuitable match. She managed to get Anne to break it off. If it had only been Sir Walter vying for the end of the match, Anne would've gone through with it; but she and Lady Russell loved each other like a mother might a daughter and vice versa. She hated Wentworth, as she thought his wit was devilish and vulgar.\n\nLady Russell also interfered when Charles Musgrove, the heir of Uppercross estate, pursued Anne for his wife. At least, this is what most of the Musgrove family believed, including Louisa Musgrove. They liked Anne the best of the Elliot girls, as she was not prone to the \"Elliot pride\" that her father and sisters were. Lady Russell didn't believe that Charles Musgrove was good enough for her Anne, so she convinced her to reject him.\n\nThis forced Charles to propose to Mary instead. They married in December of 1810.\n\nUpon hearing that Sir Walter had sunk into grave debts, Lady Russell and Mr. Shepherd, Sir Walter's financial adviser, decided that the Elliots should vacate Kellynch for the season and put it up for rent. Sir Walter decided to go to Bath with his eldest and favorite daughter, Elizabeth, while Anne would stay at Uppercross with Mary and her family. Lady Russell was annoyed at Elizabeth when the lady decided to bring Mrs. Clay to Bath with her instead of Anne. Lady Russell quit Somersetshire for a few months due to prior engagements, but worried about Anne.\n\nMonths later, Lady Russell returned to Somersetshire and met with Anne. She was coldly victorious to discover the Captain Wentworth had moved his affections to the lesser Louisa Musgrove. She was also happy to see that Anne seemed to be prettier and plumper. She and Anne visited Kellynch and the Crofts, and Lady Russell was happy to meet Mrs. Croft, although she thought Admiral Croft's manners were on the rougher side. She also heard about Captain Benwick, a friend of Captain Wentworth's who seemed to have an interest in Anne. As Lady Russell is as judgmental as they come, she said she would reserve her opinion until after she met Benwick. Charles Musgrove was convinced that Lady Russell would like Benwick; Mary Musgrove was convinced that she would not.\n\nLady Russell and Anne then went to Bath where Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Mrs. Clay were staying in Camden-place. Lady Russell was pleased to learn that William Elliot, Sir Walter's heir, had learned the error of his ways and was trying to reconcile with the head of the family. When Lady Dalrymple came to Bath, she joined the Elliots when they visited her and the lady's daughter. She was less impressed than Sir Walter and Elizabeth with the dowager viscountess, but more impressed than Anne. Although they didn't have the elegance that one would expect in members of the aristocracy, she knew that no harm would come out of such an acquaintance. She also encouraged Anne to visit her old governess and dropped her off. Elizabeth and Sir Walter, in a fit of usual snobbery, criticized Anne for choosing the acquaintance of a governess over a dowager viscountess.\n\nLady Russell began to see Mr. Elliot grow attached to Anne, and fancied a connection between the two of them. Anne, who viewed William only as a friend, thought they would not suit.

The family lives in Hertfordshire at the estate of Longbourn, near the village of Meryton. Elizabeth is particularly close with her sister Jane and Charlotte Lucas, a 'plain' woman who lives in the neighborhood. While she does love her mother, she is inclined to disagree with her at times, especially on the subject of marriage.","Elizabeth is an intelligent young woman who is described as having \"a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous\". She often presents a playful good natured impertinence that does not offend but rather endears. Early in the novel she is depicted as being personally proud of her mental quickness and her accuracy in judging the social behaviour and intentions of others."],"name":"Elizabeth Bennet","description":"Elizabeth is the second of five sisters and her father's favourite, and is described by him by having \"something more of quickness than her sisters\"; though she is often distressed and embarrassed by the behaviour of her mother and of her younger sisters. Her father is a gentleman and a landowner, but his estate, Longbourn, is entailed away from him because he does not have a son, and upon his death, Longbourn will be inherited by his cousin William Collins, a sycophantic and foolish clergyman. Elizabeth is described as being the child that her mother is \"least fond\" of, especially after she refuses Mr. Collins' proposal of marriage, probably because her mother cannot understand her. She is considered a local beauty and charming, with \"fine eyes\", which are the first features Fitzwilliam Darcy is drawn to. He is later drawn more particularly to her mind and her personality, and eventually considers her to be \"one of the handsomest women\" in his acquaintance. In her case it is truly shown that inner beauty graces the outer.\n\nThe novel primarily focuses on Elizabeth and her relationship with Fitzwilliam Darcy, a wealthy, proud man who upon their first meeting snubs her at a public dance in her home village. Elizabeth's first impression then is to disdain Mr. Darcy. When she meets handsome, attentive George Wickham, she considers him charming and personable and there is a mutual attraction between them. Wickham leads Elizabeth and the neighborhood to believe he has been unfairly treated by Darcy, claiming that Darcy denied him a living as a clergyman that was his due. However, no one draws suspicion to the fact that he had been silent while Darcy was around, and only shared his story once the Bingleys and Darcy had gone to London. Elizabeth's dislike of Darcy is further fueled by his disrupting the courtship of her beloved sister Jane and Charles Bingley, Darcy's friend. Elizabeth is persuaded that her prejudice against Darcy is well-founded, both on available evidence and upon her superior judgment of human character. Meanwhile, Jane is suffering because Mr. Bingley, the man whom she thought loved her, has gone away to London. Jane was persuaded that the cause of this departure was because Bingley's sisters, Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst, thought an attachment between their brother and Jane would not be proper because of the disparity in wealth and social position. Later Elizabeth learns from Darcy's cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, that it was Darcy who collaborated with Caroline and Louisa to separate the pair, all which causes her to dislike Mr. Darcy even more. In fact, her dislike of him at this point may go even beyond dislike and into a minor hatred.\n\nAs a result, when Darcy, who has fallen in love with her, proposes marriage\u2014only a few hours after her conversation with his cousin, and during which he constantly reminds her of the large gap in their social statuses, Elizabeth passionately refuses him. When asked why, she sharply details her reasons for disliking him, not the least being his role in separating Jane and Mr. Bingley; and, she notes the account of him received from Mr. Wickham. Finally, on his complaint of her apparent bitterness, she replies: the arrogant way by which he proposed to her prevented her from feeling concerns for him she \"might have felt... had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\n\nDarcy departs in anger and mortification; he writes a letter to Elizabeth wherein he hotly and bitterly defends his wounded honour and reveals the motives for his interference in Jane and Bingley's relationship; and he gives a full account of his lifelong dealings with Wickham. After much thought, Elizabeth recollects inconsistencies in Wickham's story, and now she suspects he is not such the honourable character as she first judged. She begins to recognize her own prejudices and her errors in judgment. Elizabeth also begins re-evaluating her opinions of Darcy who, it seems, is also committed to some significant re-evaluation of his own actions and general behaviour towards others.\n\nLater in the story Elizabeth is invited by her aunt and uncle to go Derbyshire with them. While they are there, they persuade Elizabeth to visit Darcy's estate of Pemberley, but only because Elizabeth is certain that they will not encounter him. When they arrive, Elizabeth finds the mansion and gardens beautiful and impressive. Elizabeth also feels at one point that \"to be mistress of Pemberley would be something\".\n\nWhen Darcy returns home unexpectedly a day before he is due, and meets her on the grounds of Pemberley, she is astonished at his courtesy to her and her relatives. Later, she is introduced to Georgiana Darcy, Fitzwilliam Darcy's sister. Elizabeth is charmed by Georgiana's shy disposition, and they soon become good friends.\n\nWhen Elizabeth's youngest sister, Lydia, elopes with Wickham, Darcy intervenes, and at significant expense, saves Lydia from disgrace. Although she was not intended to know about his involvement, Elizabeth finds out through her aunt that it was Darcy who found the couple and informed Mr. Garrived of their whereabouts.\n\nElizabeth realizes that her feelings for Darcy are now quite the opposite as before. She does not hate him anymore; quite to the contrary, she loves him with even more passion than she used to hate him.

Their marriage had been a happy one at first, until William Elliot had urged Smith to spend more than he ought, and to fall into vices. Their marriage had been unhappy after that, although she did not blame him completely.","She helped Anne get out of her misery and grief over her mother while at school, forever endearing her to the girl.

Theirs was a happy marriage until the arrival of William Elliot into their lives. Mr. Smith was kind to Mr. Elliot, the latter of whom was impoverished. Mr. Elliot said some disturbing things about his distant relatives, Sir Walter Elliot and Elizabeth Elliot. He wanted nothing to do with them and just wanted to be rich. He planned to get rich by marrying an heiress. The woman he chose was immensely inappropriate for the heir presumptive of a baronet. She was not a gentlewoman, but was at least educated. Upon becoming very wealthy, Mr. Elliot encouraged Mr. Smith to overspend, ruining the Smith family. Since then, she held a profound dislike of Mr. Elliot.\n\nNow poor and ruined, Mrs. Smith moved to Bath. She became reacquainted with her old friend Anne Elliot.

He owns a large estate called Pemberley in Derbyshire, England.","Mr. Darcy is a wealthy gentleman with an income exceeding £10,000 a year, and the proprietor of Pemberley, a large estate in Derbyshire, England. Darcy slighted Elizabeth Bennet at their first meeting; however, he soon realizes that his first impression was not the whole of it, and upon discovering her playful spirit, among other characteristics, he found himself attracted to her. He later attempted to court her while simultaneously struggling against the beliefs about class that he has grown up with. At the same time, Darcy disapproved when his friend Mr. Bingley expressed his love for Elizabeth's elder sister Jane and subtly convinced Bingley that Jane does not return his feelings, something which he honestly believed. He secretly felt guilty because he knew he himself had fallen in love with a social inferior: Elizabeth Bennet. It was therefore hypocritical of him to separate Charles Bingley and Jane. Upon reflection he knew this, so he decided to thereafter suppress his feelings for Elizabeth and pay her less attention. And although he didn't realize it, Elizabeth's discovery of Darcy's interference in Bingley and Jane's budding relationship and Mr. Wickham's tale of his mistreatment by Darcy had caused her to dislike him intensely, even more so than she had before.","Eventually, Mr. Darcy declared his love for Elizabeth and proposed; yet, while expressing his ardent love, he kept reminding her of the large gap in their social status. Elizabeth was offended and vehemently refused him, expressing her reasons for disliking him, including her knowledge of his interference with Jane and Bingley and the account she received from Mr. Wickham of Darcy's alleged unfair treatment toward him. Further insulted by Darcy's hurt retorts, Elizabeth claimed that the manner in which he proposed to her prevented her from feeling concern for him she \"might have felt had [he] behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner\". Darcy departed in anger and mortification and, that night, penned a letter to Elizabeth in which he defended his honor, revealed the motives for his interference in Jane and Bingley's relationship, and gave a thorough account of his lifelong dealings with Wickham, who attempted to seduce and elope with Darcy's younger sister, Georgiana, the previous summer. He later said that he had been feeling very much wronged while writing this letter, which explained the heat of his defenses and his haste in writing.","Although initially angered by Elizabeth's vehement refusal and harsh criticism, Darcy was surprised to discover the reality of how his behaviour was perceived by others, particularly Elizabeth, and commited himself to re-evaluating his actions. A few months later, Darcy unexpectedly encountered Elizabeth during her visit to his estate in Derbyshire with her aunt and uncle. Elizabeth was first mortified to be discovered at Pemberley, having only visited on the belief that Darcy was absent; however, she was surprised to discover a marked change in Darcy's manner. In response to Elizabeth's criticism and due to his subsequent realizations, Darcy was determined to display the \"gentlemanlike manner\" she accused him of lacking, and astonished her with his kindness towards both her and her relations. He was more courteous and less reserved than he had been previously, surpassing, therefore, not just Elizabeth but her aunt and uncle as well.","Darcy eventually found Lydia and Wickham, although he tried to hush the matter up. Only Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, outside of Wickham himself and Lydia, knew of Darcy's involvement in the affair. It would have continued this way had Lydia not dropped hint. That hint prompted Elizabeth to write to her aunt to tell them the truth, which her aunt couldn't refuse. Darcy later told her that he had seen the distress the elopement had caused her, spurring him to find the couple. He revealed that he did not do it to earn Elizabeth's gratitude, but rather to ease her distress. Darcy also did so because he felt himself partially responsible for the event, in failing to warn both the Bennet family and the public of Wickham's true character. It is hinted that Darcy's intervention to help Elizabeth cost him as much as a year's income; in addition, to find Lydia he had to confront Wickham, which was hardly an agreeable experience for either. He may or may not have threatened Wickham and\/or paid him additional sums to convince him to marry Lydia.","Darcy then released Mr. Bingley to return to Longbourn and woo Jane, accepting his misjudgement of her character. While calling at Longbourn after Mr. Bingley and Jane's engagement is announced, Mr. Bingley offers a walk. This offer is accepted only by Darcy, Elizabeth, Jane, and Kitty. Bingley and Jane soon drop behind, and, leaving Kitty with the Lucases, Darcy and Elizabeth are alone. Her conversation with his aunt previously made him hope, at last, that Elizabeth reciprocated his feelings. Once he was sure it was true, Darcy proposed to Elizabeth again, who accepted him this time. The couple reflected on their mistakes, and Darcy thanked Elizabeth for showing him the error of his ways: \"By you, I was properly humbled.\""],"name":"Fitzwilliam Darcy","description":"His manners drew the contempt of many in Meryton as they perceived him as proud, sanctimonious and inconsiderate due to his status. He is shown to be cold and aloof, with such a temperament being misconstrued as sheer arrogance. The narrator describes him as clever but also as \"haughty, reserved, and fastidious,\" with manners that, \"though well bred, were not inviting.\" This is shown to be only natural reserve and a discomfort in company that makes him uneasy and defensive. Darcy struggles to make new friends, which suggests that he is shy. He tells Elizabeth on their walk that he was brought up to do the right thing, but not taught to humble. Because of his status and his state of an only child, his parents never taught him to control his temper or his pride. This proves true, as his distant manner and apparent contempt for those around him earned the disdain of Elizabeth and many others, particularly in light of the claims of the charming George Wickham\u2014that he was wronged by Darcy, however, it is eventually revealed that these first impressions were erroneous: Darcy's seemingly arrogant character masked a sincerely generous and upright nature, and it was Darcy, in fact, who was wronged, by Wickham, whose own character is revealed to be untrustworthy and duplicitous. As the novel progresses, Darcy is eventually revealed to be a conscientious landlord who is generous, kind and unselfish, a caring brother, a good friend -  his impulsive interference between Jane and Bingley was motivated by genuine concern for his friend rather than malice - and a scrupulous and extremely honourable man who is protective of and self-sacrificing for those he cares about. Despite his pride, he is willing, to an extent, to admit wrongdoing. And while he possesses ingenious judgement, he is shown to not completely doubt the heart, especially his own.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Fitzwilliam_Darcy"}}

He is silent and grave, but with a sensible countenance and a gentlemanly disposition. Marianne Dashwood first thought him a very old bachelor and not very attractive in terms of matrimony. He's dignified and well-to-do, but beyond that, we don't get much from first impressions. The Colonel appears to be rather dull to the insensitive eye, but beneath his tranquil surface, there's a whole lot going on. Elinor Dashwood is the first to appreciate this, but gradually, other characters (including, finally, Marianne, when she decides to marry him) realize that he's a whole lot more than meets the eye.\n\nFirst of all, Colonel Brandon is clearly a sensitive soul, even though his exterior seems unflappable and even rather remote. He's the only person who appreciates Marianne's music the same way she does \u2013 respectfully and thoughtfully \u2013 and we get the impression that his quiet persona hides a deeply intellectual inner self. Colonel Brandon is also by far the character with the most significant emotional trauma to deal with, which he manages to do in an admirably mature, applause-worthy fashion. He's the ultimate combination of feeling and logic, and comes off as the only real grownup in this whole cast of characters.\n\nAll in all, Colonel Brandon may seem to be on the boring side, but he's actually not \u2013 he's just more under control than the other folks we meet here. We don't get to know him too well, but we can imagine that he's a pretty rewarding friend to have, once you get past his rather stiff exterior.\n\nBrandon had an older brother who died five years before the book began, thus allowing him to inherit the family estate of Delaford, located in Dorsetshire. He also has at least one sister \u2013 whether she is older or younger is unknown \u2013 as the estate of Whitwell, the site of an aborted group picnic, was said to belong to his brother-in-law, who was unnamed. He also, at one time, was very much in love with his father's ward, Eliza Williams, but she was forced to marry his elder brother, a situation which made both her and Brandon extremely unhappy. His brother, who did not treat her well, divorced her two years after the marriage and Eliza was left to fend for herself, eventually becoming pregnant by an unnamed lover and winding up in a poor house, where Brandon found her after returning from the East Indies.\n\nEliza later died of consumption, but not before extracting a promise from Brandon that he would look after her daughter, also named Eliza. Mrs. Jennings (and others) wrongly assume the younger Eliza to be Brandon's \"natural\" (illegitimate) daughter. She is seduced by Willoughby at around 16 years of age and abandoned by him, which Brandon learns only after she has been missing for 8 months. She sends a letter to him which is the reason he canceled the picnic to Whitwell, and he goes to her in London, where he learns she is pregnant with Willoughby's child. When Willoughby himself comes to London about two weeks later, after being disinherited by his aunt (who had learned of his indiscretion and demanded he marry Eliza, which he refused because he wished to marry Marianne), Brandon challenges him to a duel in defense of young Eliza's honor. It is said in the book, when he recounts the story to Elinor, that they both \"walked away unwounded\", but it can be assumed that Brandon bested him and allowed him to live only because of the grief it would cause Marianne.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Colonel_Brandon"}}

Though she ultimately did not marry a peer or an heir to a peerage, she still made an extremely advantageous match: Lewis de Bourgh, a knighted and extremely wealthy gentleman who owned the palatial estate of Rosings Park. Lady Catherine would come to have a daughter, whom she named after her sister, Lady Anne.\n\nIt was never specifically revealed or confirmed as to what kind of relationship Lady Catherine had with her sister and her brother (who inherited their father's earldom later on). However, she later claimed she and her sister had planned a betrothal between their children (Fitzwilliam and Anne) when they were still in their infancy, and that it was their favourite wish, though whether this was the honest truth or a mere lie on her part remains a mystery.\n\nHer husband, Sir Lewis, died before the course of the novel. Although he was not aristocratic, Lady Catherine still esteemed him and his family greatly, and even once described his family as \"respectable, honorable, and ancient, though untitled\". The de Bourgh family never saw fit to entail the estate, so it was left to Anne de Bourgh, as opposed to a distant male relative. It is important to note that Lady Catherine likely does not own the estate, and all evidence points to Anne owning it, as she is described as the \"heiress of Rosings\". Sir Lewis would have had to trust his wife beyond belief to leave his estate to her, as she would have put the estate directly into the ownership of a new spouse if she remarried.\n\nLady Catherine still harbored the hope that her daughter and her nephew would be joined in marriage, even when Mr. Darcy was 25. She also became the patron of Mr. Collins, a man who admired her greatly. She offered him a parsonage and a rectory. According to Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine did not mind if Mr. Collins left the rectory for a few Sundays.\n\nWhen Elizabeth Bennet came to stay with the Collinses, Lady Catherine invited the three of them to dinner. She was impressed and slightly shocked with Elizabeth's opinionated demeanor, but didn't think much of her family or the girl in general.\n\nShe was angered to hear a rumor that Mr. Darcy was engaged to Elizabeth and went to Longbourn immediately to learn the truth and to try and force Elizabeth to promise never to consider such an engagement.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Catherine_de_Bourgh"}}

It was also very off putting for Catherine when Isabella asked James for a long engagement after learning that they would receive a yearly income of only £400 from Mr. Morland."],"name":"Catherine Morland","description":"Catherine grew up in the county of Wiltshire, and was one of ten siblings. Her mother did not require her two eldest daughters to be accomplished as she had so many other children to care for, so Catherine never acquired the skills that many young ladies of means did. She shirked her lessons, and did not put her heart and soul into learning. She was an avid reader, and took many of the themes she read to heart.\n\nWhen Catherine was seventeen, she was invited to go to Bath with Mr. and Mrs. Allen, the latter of whom was expressly fond of her. Her parents accepted such an invitation for her, but Mrs. Morland worried over her daughter when she was leaving without stop. She warned Catherine to be careful, to stay warm, and especially to stay out of trouble.\n\nThe Allens and Catherine set up on Pulteney St., a fashionable part of the city. There, she became immersed in the social life that Bath had to offer, although she was a bit nervous at first having no acquaintances besides the Allens. She became acquainted with the handsome and fashionable Henry Tilney, and they talked of books and fashion together.\n\nShe later met Mrs. Thorpe, a widow, and her daughters. Catherine immediately got along with Isabella, the eldest Thorpe daughter, and they moved through the stages of friendship quite quickly. They soon addressed each other by their Christian names, and were never seen without each other. They especially talked of books of the Gothic genre, namely Udolpho by Ann Radcliffe.\n\nShe and Isabella ran into John Thorpe, Isabella's brother, and James Morland, Catherine's brother in Bath while the two young men were driving. John Thorpe gave Catherine a ride to her destination in his curricle, which Isabella pushed, mostly because she wanted to be alone with James Morland. They attended an assembly in the Upper Rooms of the pump room later, where Catherine saw Henry Tilney again, along with a young lady whom she immediately assumed was his sister, as she did not want to acknowledge that he might be lost to her forever by being already married. She was introduced to Miss Tilney by Mrs. Hughes, the other young lady's companion. She wanted so much to be liked by Miss Tilney because of her relationship to Henry that she said whatever she thought, which barred any sort of intimacy in their first meeting.\n\nHenry asked her to dance, but she had already promised her hand to John Thorpe, much to her chagrin. Mrs. Thorpe was eager to hear praise about her son from Catherine later. She could not find Henry Tilney again, which upset her and made her only want to go home. Later, Catherine wallowed in misery by eating as much as possible back at the Allens' apartments on Pulteney St., and slept for nine hours. She woke up with the dearest wish of becoming a closer acquaintance of Miss Tilney's first and foremost. This was all ruined when John Thorpe arrived saying he had come to take her for a drive in his gig, and that Isabella and James were waiting outside for them. Catherine, dismayed, tried to get out of it more than once subtly, but none of her efforts worked and she had to go and listen to John brag, while Isabella was with her brother.\n\nCatherine was greatly pleased when Mr. and Miss Tilney were at the theater the same night. Isabella and James sat together, and Isabella made sure to show James how close of a friendship she had with his sister. She was very excited to see Miss Tilney again, who met her with civility, and she asked Miss Tilney about the young woman who was dancing with her brother and whether or not Miss Tilney thought Miss Smith was at all pretty. At the end of their conversation, Miss Tilney had an idea that Catherine had an affection for her brother, but Catherine, being Catherine, did not realize she gave so much away to her new acquaintance.\n\nCatherine danced with Mr. Tilney later that evening, much to John Thorpe's chagrin. Thorpe actually interrupted them in the middle of their dance, to ask why Catherine was dancing with Mr. Tilney and not him. It was a showcase of such poor manners that it brought Mr. Tilney over the moment Thorpe left. She assured Tilney that she had no connection with John, only that he was a particular friend of her brother's. This seemed to mollify Tilney, who, after their dance, escorted her downstairs to meet his father, General Tilney, who greeted Catherine with the utmost civility. Catherine made plans to go for a walk with Mr. and Miss Tilney if the weather was favorable the next day.\n\nThe weather was not favorable the next morning until Catherine began to not worry about it so much. However, everything was nearly ruined with John and Isabella Thorpe and her brother came in their carriages to go on an excursion. Catherine refused to go at first, but Mrs. Allen pushed her into going later. During the ride, Catherine saw Miss Tilney and urged Thorpe to stop the carriage, but he made them go faster. Later, Catherine saw Thorpe talking with General Tilney, and she worried that he was telling the General untruths about her, which shows her mistrust of the Thorpes.\n\nOver the next few days, John and Isabella used manipulation in order to separate Catherine from the Tilney family. Isabella used James Morland's affection for her to get him to side against his beloved sister. While Catherine was being distracted by Isabella's charade, John went to Miss Tilney and told her of Catherine's prior engagement, which was never really a prior engagement at all. She went after the Tilneys, but could not catch up to them, and then just went back to her lodgings on Pulteney St. She talked to the Allens about what happened, and both Mr. and Mrs. Allen advised her to stay away from John Thorpe. The next day, Catherine knew it would be okay if the Thorpes came to pressure her into going on their outing with Mr. Allen on her side, but they never came, and she went out with the Tilneys at the appointed hour. She ran into Anne Thorpe, the younger sister of Isabella and John, and asked her about the outing, learning that they did indeed go.\n\nThe next day, Isabella told her about her new engagement with James, and Catherine's apprehension about her friend was put to rest. She chalked up a lot of Isabella's feelings for her brother as being the product of love. Mr. Morland wrote that he gave his consent to the match, and Catherine was happy for Isabella and her brother. Catherine accidentally encouraged John Thorpe's suit by mistaking his wish to visit her in Fullerton as being because of friendship as opposed to a romantic advance. He or Isabella likely mentioned the success of the suit to a member of the Tilney family, as both Eleanor and Henry Tilney acted very cold toward Catherine the next day at tea. Isabella told her their actions were likely due to their snobbery, and that Catherine should stay away from them\u2014she did not take this advice. She danced with Henry Tilney that night and met his handsome brother, Frederick Tilney, who danced with Isabella much to Catherine's surprise.\n\nUpon her sixth week in Bath, Catherine was invited to Northanger Abbey by Eleanor Tilney and General Tilney. After receiving the Tilneys' invitation to their family seat, Catherine immediately wrote home to Fullerton, asking permission. Her parents did not disappoint, as they viewed the Allens with the utmost admiration, and knew that any acquaintance garnered under their care would be quite a good one. Catherine thought herself the luckiest of humans after receiving their consent.\n\nIsabella's behavior began to get even more peculiar to Catherine, as she was always under the impression that Isabella was very trustworthy and a good friend. Isabella subtly accused Catherine of flirting and leading on two men at once, both John Thorpe and Henry Tilney and Catherine was very put off by her behavior. It also made Catherine very uncomfortable when she noticed that Isabella flirted with Frederick Tilney just as much as she flirted with James. She also saw how it was hurting her brother and entreated Henry to tell his elder brother that Isabella was already engaged to James. Henry told her that he already had, and that his brother was his own man. He also pointed out that maybe Isabella was not as in love with James as she appeared, and as Catherine thought.\n\nHenry did advise Catherine to stay out of it, as James would hardly thank her for her interference, and soon Catherine saw that everything was back to \"normal\".\n\nShe left soon after with Miss Tilney, bound for Northanger Abbey. Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sad to lose her, as she was a valuable companion for both of them. Catherine began to feel a little sorry for Captain Tilney when his father reproved him. She learned that Henry actually didn't live at Northanger most of the time, as he had his own house twenty miles from Northanger. He worried her though, when he started a tale about the abbey being haunted. Her excited belief gave him a lot of amusement, and he stopped the story before his amusement gave him away. The idea stuck with her, however.\n\nUpon arriving at Northanger, Catherine was relieved to see that her apartments bore no resemblance to the haunted and creepy ones that Henry jokingly described on the journey over. She did find a mysterious wooden chest, which she opened and discovered a white counterpane within. At that moment, Miss Tilney came in to see if she was ready, and noted the oddness of the chest.\n\nHer first night at Northanger only succeeded in arousing her suspicions further about the haunted aspect of the house. A tempest raged outside, creating a very dramatic and creepy feel in the room. She refused to go to bed as she wished to discover the haunted elements. She found a \"manuscript\" hidden, and was shocked to be unable to read the letters in the scant light. She knew that this must have been what Henry was talking about.\n\nThe next morning, she realized that the \"manuscript\" was not really that at all, but an account of expenditures. She laughed over her folly, and hoped that Henry never did discover her error. When she went down to breakfast, Henry was surprisingly there, and alone. When the general arrived, they had a very elegant breakfast, and then Henry had to leave for his estate, Woodston, and would be gone for 2 or 3 days.\n\nGeneral Tilney began to show Catherine the more intricate and grand parts of the estate, including the drawing-room, and the library. When she heard that the general rarely accompanied his wife on her walks around the garden and that he did not display her portrait in the drawing-room as he originally intended, Catherine began to believe him to be a man of extreme cruelty. She began to suspect him even of murdering his wife in cold blood while their children were from home. After she had sneaked into Mrs. Tilney's former apartments, she met Henry on the stairs. After asking him a few questions about his parents' marriage, Henry began to realize what exactly she suspected and scolded her for it. She was appalled at herself and deeply shamed, and was convinced that he hated her. It was then that she realized that the characters of Ann Radcliffe cannot really be projected onto any real person in modernity, and that she was a fool for thinking thus.\n\nNot long after the incident outside the late Mrs. Tilney's former apartments, Catherine received a letter from her brother James detailing Isabella's deception and betrayal. Isabella had moved her affections from James to Frederick, as she believed the latter man was far more wealthy.\n\nShe later told the Tilney siblings about Frederick's interest in Isabella, and Henry was apprehensive that Frederick would marry Isabella. Frederick had never been stalwart in that respect. Eleanor, after reading the letter, asked Catherine of Miss Thorpe's connections and fortune, and learned that she indeed is not very wealthy and that her late father was a lawyer. Catherine learned that both siblings thought that Isabella was after money, and thus that would not bode well in a marriage with Frederick. She also learned that General Tilney would be likely to very strongly oppose the match between his eldest son and Isabella.\n\nWhile waiting for Captain Tilney's letter asking for permission to wed Isabella, Catherine was able to see Henry's house, Woodston, as well as the lovely cottage connected to it. She also received a very surprising letter from Isabella asking her to convince James to take her back.\n\nGeneral Tilney had to quit Northanger for a bit to go to London. He soon demanded that his family be removed from Northanger to stay at Lord Longtown's for some unknown reason. Catherine was worried that she offended the general at some point.\n\nCatherine had to make the full trip to Fullerton since the Allens had quit Bath, so she couldn't go to them. The entire journey was 70 miles. Eleanor Tilney had been worried about such a young woman her age making such a trip alone, but Catherine assured her friend that she would be fine. On the journey home, she cried and grieved about what had happened. Once she reached home, the parsonage, she was greeted by her family, including her young siblings George and Harriet. Mrs. Morland believed that General Tilney had acted dishonorably and unfeelingly by sending Catherine away.\n\nIt soon became known that the general acted that way because he believed that Catherine was trying to deceive him about her wealth and future inheritances. The idea was started by John Thorpe, who made it sound as if Catherine's family was extremely wealthy already, and that she would inherit most of Mr. Allen's wealth upon his passing. The general heard a different story from the same person later in London, after John was reeling from being rejected by Catherine, and told the general that she had nothing. This is what prompted him just sending her away. His only daughter, Eleanor Tilney, married the man of her dreams, a very handsome and kind viscount. His daughter and new son-in-law assisted Henry in getting their father's approval for a match between Henry and Catherine.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Catherine_Morland"}}

When Mr. Gardiner and Mrs. Gardiner leave Longbourn, Jane goes with them to their house on Gracechurch Street. While there, she calls on Caroline and Louisa, and they promise to visit her in the next few days. Three weeks pass by, and finally Caroline arrives. She makes no effort to hide her disgust with Jane's family and connections, and soon leaves. Jane is unvisited by Charles Bingley, convincing her that he does not care for her after all. Jane concludes her report of this to Lizzy with this; \"I am now convinced that Mr. Bingley no longer cares for me.\" It is later unveiled that Mr. Darcy orchestrated this separation of Bingley and Jane, purposely neglecting to tell Bingley that Jane was in London (this later becomes Lizzy's rationale for refusing Darcy's first proposal to her). A heartsick Miss Bennet fades out of the story for a while, until a letter of hers reaches Elizabeth while she is touring Derbyshire, informing her that their youngest sister Lydia had eloped with the deceptive George Wickham. She becomes secondarily involved in the process of saving Lydia's honour, doing about as much as Elizabeth does, which is waiting with baited breath for news of the situation. After all is righted (and Darcy has a change of heart), she and Bingley become engaged and marry."],"name":"Jane Bennet","description":"Jane is described by many as a \"sweet girl.\" In contrast to her sister Lizzy, she is docile, soft-spoken and in every way lovely. She is considered the perfect woman by her society, and when her separation from Bingley begins, no one blames her in the least. She is unknowingly popular, and she is every bit as sensible as her sister Elizabeth (if not as clever, as Mr. Bennet believes). She is kind, considerate, intelligent, beautiful, good with children, and, apparently, each parent's second favorite. (Mr. bennet's because she has uncommon good sense, and her mother's due to her docility and beauty).\n\nJane sees the world through rose colored glasses. She sees the best in everybody and assumes that everyone is acting out of the best motives. Even after Wickham elopes with her youngest sister, she assumes that it was done out of love and with every intention of getting married. Although she feels things deeply, her manners are described as reserved.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jane_Bennet"}}

Although their father made him promise to 'take care' of his half-sisters and stepmother, Fanny easily persuades him that this does not actually mean monetary assistance, leaving his stepmother and half-sisters with no dowry and very little to live on."],"name":"Elinor Dashwood","description":"In this novel, Austen analyzes the conflict between the opposing temperaments of sense (logic, propriety, and thoughtfulness, as expressed in Austen's time by neo-classicists), and sensibility (emotion, passion, unthinking action, as expressed in Austen's time by romantics). In this conflict, Elinor, a reserved, practical, and thoughtful young woman who embodies the \"sense\" of the title, is juxtaposed to her passionate younger sister Marianne who embodies \"sensibility\". Elinor may be loosely based on the author's older sister, Cassandra Austen.\n\nElinor is described as possessing a coolness of judgement and strength of understanding which qualifies her to be her mother's frequent counsellor, and sometimes she shows more common sense than her mother, whose judgment is shown to be flawed by her exaggerated notions of romantic delicacy. Her mother is more often preoccupied with Marianne and her problems. Although Austen writes that Elinor's feelings are just as passionate and deep as Marianne's, she knows how to govern them better, as she is more aware of the demands society makes upon women and more prepared to compromise. She is described as having a delicate complexion, regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure\u2014although less striking than Marianne, more \"correct\"\u2014which Austen uses as a good overall summary of their characters as well as their physical appearance. She is more polite than Marianne, though her repugnance towards vulgarity and selfishness is quite equal; and thus she can appreciate the rather vulgar but good hearted Mrs. Jennings, and be civil to people Marianne would be repulsed by such as Lucy Steele.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elinor_Dashwood"}}

Captain Wentworth is the younger brother of Mr. Wentworth, the curate of Monkford. Both of his parents are dead. He has one sister, Mrs. Croft, who is married to Admiral Croft. Although he was originally not wealthy at all, he had made no less than £20,000 while abroad, making him a very desirable marriage prospect. He marries Anne Elliot, the middle daughter of a baronet, in 1814.","In 1806 when first falling in love with Anne, Captain Wentworth was a fine looking young man. He had a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy. He was also witty, which did not help him win the affection of his beloved's godmother, Lady Russell, who believed it to be an aggravation of the devil.","He loved Anne when they lived near each other in 1806. They would never stop talking and they were lively in their romance. He was incredibly hurt when she broke it off with him, though. Since he knew the main reasons to be Lady Russell and her father, he blamed her for being such a follower as opposed to finding her own path. When he returned from his many years abroad, he didn't really know what to do with Anne. He was still hurt so he turned his attentions resolutely away from her to the Musgrove girls, finally deciding on Louisa. After Louisa left him for Benwick, Wentworth realized he still had feelings for Anne. He fell in love with her again in Bath and was worried when he realized that Mr. Elliot, heir presumptive to the Elliot baronetcy, was interested in Anne as well. He finally made his sentiments known in a personal letter that he handed to her himself. She, too, had never replaced him and they married, this time with support from her family."],"name":"Frederick Wentworth","description":"Captain Wentworth lived at Monkford estate in 1806, and harbored an affection for Anne Elliot, the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall. Saying that Sir Walter simply disapproved of the possible marriage between his daughter and Captain Wentworth would be a severe understatement; Sir Walter found it to be degrading in all aspects. He was astonished and immediately became cold towards his middle daughter. Lady Russell, who also did not approve, went about it in a much more genteel way than how Sir Walter acted. Captain Wentworth had nearly nothing to his name at this point, and was not even a gentleman.\n\nWhen Lady Russell and Sir Walter convinced Anne to break any engagements and promises she had with him, he was hurt and felt ill-used. He left Somersetshire. This did have a lasting negative effect on Anne, who lost most of her beauty due to heartbreak. She also never replaced him, although offers from eligible gentlemen were made to her over the years.\n\nThe first ship, a sloop, that he commanded was dubbed The Asp, and he was the last man who commanded her. She had hardly been fit for service when he had acquired her, but Admiral Croft commended her highly. He had captured several privateers and pirates while commanding her, and he claimed he never had a day of bad weather while sailing her.\n\nHe then acquired a French frigate, which ended the luck the Asp brought. He was hit by a storm that would've killed him if he had still been in the Asp, but he managed to survive, much to Anne's great relief. The ship was called \"The Laconia\". He took Richard Musgrove as one of his crew while captaining the Laconia. He did not like Dick Musgrove, but talked serenely and deeply about him with Mrs. Musgrove when the lady asked. He made no less than £20,000 while abroad.\n\nCaptain Wentworth was to return to England in order to see his sister and her husband as they were renting Kellynch Hall from Sir Walter. The captain had been the commander of a frigate. The news of his return shook Anne's nerves.\n\nHe stayed with his sister and brother-in-law at Kellynch, the very home of the man who had scorned his suit for his daughter. Upon seeing Anne again, it was awkward for both of them. He was a bit ungallant and told Henrietta Musgrove that Anne looked so different that he would not have known her. In his defense, he did not know that what he said would reach Anne, although he was still angry at her for how he thought she used him. He also wanted to marry, as he was rich and needed a wife.\n\nHis interactions with his former love Anne were very awkward. He was coldly civil to her, much to her dismay, as he was still reeling with hurt from the past. He spent a lot of time at Uppercross, where Anne was staying, since he had a bunch of admirers in Louisa and Henrietta Musgrove, as well as the Miss Hayters. He told stories about his time abroad and the ships that he captained.\n\nHe told his sister that he intended to find a wife and he began to pursue one of the Musgrove girls, although it was clear that he couldn't decide at first. He then set his eyes on Louisa, who told him some information about Anne's past that he did not know; that Charles Musgrove preferred Anne to Mary. His sister, Sophia didn't actually approve of either Musgrove girl for her dear brother. She never spoke of her disapproval, but it was clear to Anne.\n\nWentworth began to woo Louisa, as Henrietta had an understanding with her cousin, Charles Hayter, who had disliked Wentworth from their first meeting since he viewed him as a rival. When Wentworth heard that his old friend from the navy, Captain Harville, was staying in Lyme with his wife and another naval captain, Wentworth suggested that the Musgroves, including Anne, come with him to Lyme for a holiday. The idea was well met, and Anne agreed to the invitation as well. While in Lyme, Louisa suffered a bad concussion when trying to jump down from a few steps. She was bedridden for quite a few days, and Wentworth was beside himself with horror\u2014as he felt it was his fault that she was injured. They were all very relieved when a surgeon examined Louisa and proclaimed she would be fine as long as she rested.\n\nWhile Anne was staying in Bath, Louisa turned her affections to James Benwick, another naval captain. Wentworth let her go, not one to make a fuss about such things.\n\nAfter his courtship of Louisa was cut short, Wentworth went to stay with his sister and brother in law in Bath. He ran into Anne and escorted her home when there was no room in Lady Dalrymple's barouche. It was raining, so he offered the use of his umbrella.\n\nWentworth's affection for Anne was reborn. He attended a concert hosted by Lady Dalrymple because he knew Anne would be there. They were very aware of each other through the entire event. He unfortunately heard that Mr. Elliot planned to propose marriage to Anne, and he became so jealous and stricken that he had to leave the event early despite his love of music.\n\nHe was surprisingly admired by Sir Walter and Lady Dalrymple, the former who used to not think much of him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Frederick_Wentworth"}}

If I lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it\" (25.25). She does end up losing Edmund in the end, but it was vague, as to whether not Mary and Edmund would have made a good couple anyway. In retrospect, they may have kept hesitating and dancing around each other for some very good reasons. And, ultimately, Mary may have performed the role she was supposed to: she contrasted to Fanny and cast Fanny in a light that was eventually appealing to Edmund. As our almost-heroine, Mary effectively made sure that the \"actual\" heroine ends up with her hero."],"name":"Mary Crawford","description":"When her mother was still alive, Mary and her brother were very dear to their elder half sister, Mrs. Grant (maiden name unknown). Upon the death of their mutual parent, they became distant as the Crawfords lived exclusively with their paternal uncle Admiral Crawford, and his wife Mrs. Crawford. The admiral and his wife had a very tempestuous marriage, and they did not get along. The only thing they had in common was a mutual adoration of their nephew and niece. The admiral was a man of \"vicious nature\" who invited his mistress to live under his roof with his nephew and niece in residence, after the death of Mrs. Crawford. As such, Mary and her brother had a very unusual, and perhaps immoral upbringing. This might have led to Mary's views on religion and morality in general.\n\nAs her uncle was an admiral, she learned quite a bit about the naval profession, but it was evident that she did not have a high opinion of him, which shocked both Edmund Bertram and Fanny Price, the latter of which referred to Mary as \"ungrateful\". Her dislike of her uncle may have come from her aunt's dislike of him, as she was taken under Mrs. Crawford's wing while Henry was taken under the admiral's.\n\nMary and Henry went to visit their half-sister Mrs. Grant at the parsonage near Mansfield, thus adding their presence to the society of the village. They were so pleased that they decided to stay for longer than what was planned, which agreed with Mrs. Grant and her husband. Mary was also pleased that the Bertrams, a family of consequence, lived so close to the Grants. Mary wanted matrimony, provided only that she marry well and into greater comfort. Their meeting with the Bertrams went remarkably well, as the Miss Bertrams were immediately taken in by Mary's beauty and Henry's lively manner. When her brother showed interest in the eldest Miss Bertram, as opposed to Julia Bertram, she tried to remind him that the lady was engaged to James Rushworth.\n\nMary was a bit confused about Fanny Price and asked Tom and Edmund Bertram about their cousin and whether she was out in society or not. She remarked about how Fanny rarely spoke during dinners. This got them into a discussion about a young lady's morality in terms of being in society or no. After hearing that Fanny has never attended a ball and stays primarily by the side of Lady Bertram\u2014who never attends social functions\u2014Mary deduced that Fanny was indeed \"not out\".\n\nMary first set her sights on Thomas Bertram, who was the heir apparent to Mansfield, an excellent property. She was somewhat charmed by Edmund as well. When Tom was off to B\u2014\u2014 for horse racing, Mary thought there would be a loss in their small village society. Despite Edmund's disapproval at Mary's ungrateful words about the uncle who took her in, he brought her riding around the park. Later, a trip to Sotherton Court, the ancestral home of James Rushworth, was planned. Mary sat in the back of her brother's barouche with Fanny Price and Maria Bertram, while Julia sat in the front with Henry.\n\nMary became interested in Edmund during Tom's absence. While visiting Sotherton with the Bertrams and various others, she was shocked to discover that Edmund wished to become a clergyman. She did not know, and was embarrassed that she had made a few disrespectful remarks about clergymen in front of Edmund in the past. She was also dismayed to learn that he would receive no fortune from a well-meaning and childless uncle, or a grandfather.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mary_Crawford"}}

When Catherine refused to go on a few outings because she was invited to go walking with Henry Tilney and his sister, Eleanor Tilney, Isabella manipulated James into siding with her against Catherine.\n\nJames finally proposed to Isabella after going on a carriage outing without Catherine present. Isabella agreed to the engagement, and James wrote immediately to his father for his approval. Mr. Morland gave his heartfelt consent, but did not tell them about the particulars of the match until later\u2014this was fine for Isabella who still thought she snagged a wealthy man. When he informed Isabella that they would receive £400 per year from Mr. Morland, on account of him having nine other children to look after, Isabella's devotion altered. It was almost unnoticeable except if one looked for it, because at first Isabella only asked for a long engagement of 2 to 3 years, which disappointed James a little, but he did not argue against it. James was finally fully alerted to Isabella's altered manner when he noticed how she openly flirted with Captain Tilney, and often gave the other man just as many smiles and as much attention as she gave James.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/James_Morland"}}

She starts off professing a great friendliness for Jane Bennet, but later conspired with Louisa and Darcy to separate Jane and Charles when it became increasingly evident that her brother was truly in love with Jane and desired to marry her (she wanted her brother to marry Georgiana - Darcy's sister - instead, hoping that a match between Charles and Georgiana will make a match between she herself and Darcy more likely). One of the reasons why she looked down on the Bennets was their connections to trade, which was, ironically, also the very source of her own family's wealth."],"name":"Caroline Bingley","description":"Caroline was born into a respectable family that resided in the north of England. Her father made most of his money in trade, making the Bingleys part of the nouveau riche, or \"new money\". This would have been seen as inferior by many of the realm's great nobles and landed gentry, those who have inherited their wealth.\n\nDue to her family's prosperity, she and her sister, Louisa, were most likely raised in luxury. They attended one of the first private seminaries in London. Each sister later came to have a respective fortune of £20,000, and Caroline hoped to catch the eye of Mr. Darcy, an eligible bachelor who was a dear friend of her brother's.\n\nMiss Bingley went with her brother, sister and brother-in-law, and Mr. Darcy to stay at Netherfield Park, the manor of which Mr. Bingley had taken possession. She first met the Bennet sisters at a public ball in Meryton. She only danced with Mr. Darcy, and he only danced with her and Louisa, earning him the ire of Mrs. Bennet and other matchmaking mothers. She was informed that Mary Bennet was the most accomplished girl in the neighborhood.\n\nThe next time Miss Bingley saw the Bennet women was when they came to call at Netherfield. Miss Bingley and her sister immediately took the eldest Miss Bennet, Jane, who had very pleasing manners, setting her apart from her mother and her younger sisters. Miss Bingley was shocked to learn that Mr. Darcy, the very man she had designs on, was interested in Elizabeth Bennet. She hid her shock and alarm by reminding Mr. Darcy of the relations he would have if he married her, and that the deplorable and unmannerly Mrs. Bennet would often be at Pemberley.\n\nJane was forbidden to use the carriage and instead went on horseback, all due to the machinations of Mrs. Bennet to get her with Mr. Bingley. Jane immediately caught a cold and was invited to stay at Netherfield. Elizabeth went to join her sister at Netherfield, shocking Caroline and Louisa with the state of her dress from walking through mud. Caroline took the time to needle Mr. Darcy about Elizabeth's ill-breeding. She was especially sure to mention Mr. Phillips, their uncle who is an attorney in Meryton; and Edward Gardiner, their uncle who lives near Cheapside\u2014an unfashionable part of London.\n\nThroughout the evening, she becomes a champion of whatever Mr. Darcy says, in order to get him to notice her.\n\nHowever, her attempts to criticize all yielded the opposite results of highlighting Elizabeth's positive qualities, and making Darcy acknowledge his true feelings over what was expected of him (in his own prejudiced opinion).\n\nMiss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst became quite alarmed at the attraction growing between Mr. Bingley and the eldest Miss Bennet. Although they liked Jane better than her family, they really didn't want to be connected to the Bennets. They settled in London for the winter.\n\nMiss Bingely received Jane at their London townhouse on Grosvenor St. She disguised her displeasure by being overtly glad, and she quickly dispelled any way to see Mr. Bingley by saying he was mostly in the company of Mr. Darcy, and that neither she nor Louisa saw much of him. Miss Bingley never extended another invitation to Jane after that, and the latter soon realized that she was being snubbed rudely.\n\nMiss Bingley visited Mr. Darcy's ancestral home Pemberley with her brother and sister. She was not happy to see Miss Elizabeth at the manor, as she was still trying to get Mr. Darcy to like her enough to propose. She and her sister let and awkward silence after recognizing Elizabeth with only a curtsy. Mrs. Annesley stepped in and saved the day from the Bingley sisters' ill-breeding. Throughout the evening, Miss Bingley was exceedingly rude and uncultured and insulted Elizabeth's family directly\n\nLater on, after Darcy had been shocked into rectifying his behaviour from Elizabeth's passionate rejection of his marriage proposal, he refused to oblige or even tolerate Caroline's criticisms of Elizabeth. He even went as far as to tell her that he considered Elizabeth to be \"one of the handsomest women\" of his acquaintance, which pained Caroline to the extent where she actually stopped her tirade.\n\nCaroline was said to be very deeply mortified by Darcy's and Elizabeth's marriage, but as she wanted to retain the right of being able to visit Pemberley, she released her resentment, retained her original deferential attitude towards Darcy and Georgiana, and took care to treat Elizabeth with all politeness and respect.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Caroline_Bingley"}}

After Mrs. Tilney died, Eleanor took the portrait to hang it in her own room in order to remember her mother.\n\nHis wife was taken by a sudden illness, and even Eleanor was away from home when this happened. When Catherine hears of the suddenness, she believes that General Tilney's villainy is set in stone and speculates that he killed his wife.\n\nAfter Mrs. Tilney's untimely death, General Tilney had a very elegant monument erected in the church in his late wife's honor.\n\nEleanor Tilney, his daughter, presumably told him that Catherine Morland had set her sights on his son, Henry Tilney. He came to Bath to meet the young lady and to see if she was a fit match for his son. He examined her very earnestly while she and Henry Tilney were descending the stairs after their dance.\n\nCatherine was worried when she saw the general in conversation with John Thorpe, as she thought the other man would tell the general that she was attached to him. It turned out that Thorpe was actually regaling the general of Catherine's future wealth, as he believed he would be married to Catherine and thus be privy to that wealth. This is the main reason why the general was so kind to Catherine while she stayed with them at Northanger.\n\nThe Tilneys returned to their grand estate with Catherine Morland in tow, as Eleanor now considered Catherine to be a close friend. General Tilney was glad to be able to show the impressive estate to another person.\n\nCatherine's suspicions about the nature of General and Mrs. Tilney's marriage were piqued during this stay. Catherine came to the belief that the general had murdered his wife in cold blood.\n\nThe general had to go to London for business, and told his children to watch over Catherine. While in London, he heard that Catherine was to be virtually penniless and was not the heiress of the Allen fortune, from ironically, the very person who told him she was quite an heiress, John Thorpe. Thorpe, who was still reeling from Catherine's rejection, told General Tilney that Catherine was not very wealthy at all. The general, who believed this mistake was due to a deception on Catherine's part, had her turned out of Northanger almost immediately, and sent back to Fullerton, Wiltshire. The general wanted his children to marry people with money. He called his second son, Henry, a fool for wanting to go after Catherine. His daughter ended up marrying a very handsome viscount, who was also very wealthy. The viscount and viscountess convinced General Tilney to give Henry his blessing.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/General_Tilney"}}

Her aunt is Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her uncle is Earl Fitzwilliam. She is a cousin of Anne de Bourgh, and Colonel Fitzwilliam, among others.","When Georgiana was only fifteen, Mr. Wickham tried to convince her of his love in order to get her dowry with the help of Mrs. Younge.

Jane Austen claims that she was quite astonished to learn that a wife may take liberties with her husband that a sister cannot always take with her brother (ten years senior).

She reminded Isabella of James Morland, Catherine's brother. Isabella's brother was a friend of James's at school, and the Thorpes had him for Christmas the year before.\n\nIsabella and Catherine became fast friends, and moved through the stages of friendship quite quickly during both their stays in the city. They called each other by their Christian names, dispensing with usual formality, walked hand in hand, and were not to be divided while dancing. They even shared a mutual love of the Gothic novel, specifically novels by Ann Radcliffe. Isabella was overjoyed to learn that James Morland was in town, and began to spend as much time with him as possible, with the goal of marrying him, as she believed that James was heir to a larger fortune than he was\u2014but none of the Morlands never deceived them about this. She pushed Catherine towards her brother, John Thorpe, a vain man who swore almost every sentence. Isabella made it her goal to snag James, as she believed him to be wealthier than he was, or the heir to much more wealth than he was. She even ruined Catherine's plans to go to the pump-room to talk with Eleanor Tilney when she pushed her to accompany them on a carriage ride.\n\nJames finally proposed to her presumably after she, James, her brother, and Maria Thorpe, went on a carriage excursion. Catherine was a bit shocked to learn about their love, but was happy for her brother and good friend. She chalked up a lot of Isabella's praises of her brother to love as opposed to what was actually true, as she didn't think him that handsome and knew him to be only moderately wealthy at best. The couple only had to receive consent from James's father, and Isabella waited nervously for Mr. Morland's consent in the mail, and celebrated with her mother and brother because they believed she snagged a very wealthy young gentleman. Mr. Morland finally sent his consent, although without particulars, but Isabella did not need those so readily and was quite pleased with herself. This didn't really sway Catherine's judgment of them at all.\n\nOnce her engagement with James was final, Isabella and John then did everything they could to drive a wedge between Catherine and the Tilney family, namely Henry and Eleanor, so that Catherine would accept John's suit, and get more of the fortune that the Thorpes believes the Morlands possessed. When Catherine expressed dismay at how cold Henry and Eleanor were when she visited the family for tea, Isabella said very dramatically that their distance had all to do with haughtiness and pride in order to dissuade Catherine from continuing her acquaintance with the Tilneys. She continued to try to show her devotion to James Morland by telling Catherine that in no certain terms would be be dancing with anyone but her fiancé. She later proved herself a liar when she danced with Frederick Tilney, the handsome brother of Henry Tilney, much to Catherine's surprise. She later said that Frederick had pushed and pushed until she relented, which was not the case.\n\nIsabella's happiness with her engagement waned considerably when Mr. Morland's next letter came to lay out the particulars. James would only receive £400 a year for his marriage, because the Morland family truly was not extremely wealthy, and there were also nine other children to take into account. Isabella immediately asked for a 2 to 3 year engagement\u2014longer than the usual engagement\u2014in order to look for better offers.\n\nIsabella found a \"better offer\" quite quickly in the handsome army captain Frederick Tilney, the elder brother of Mr. Henry Tilney and the heir of Northanger Abbey. When Catherine was invited to stay at Northanger by General Tilney and Eleanor, Isabella told Catherine that she must tell her everything about the estate, as she would like \"particular description\" about it\u2014which hinted that she wished to snag Captain Tilney as a husband, and turn her sights away from James Morland. Catherine, being very trusting of Isabella at this point in their acquaintance, did not pick up on this, despite the fact that Isabella had danced with Tilney multiple times even though she said she would not dance with any man besides her fiancé, and that Isabella seemed to be looking for someone despite knowing that James would not attend the gathering. Isabella also informed Catherine of John Thorpe's romantic interest in her, and accused her gently of knowing she was encouraging her brother. Catherine, all shocked, responded that she had no idea. Isabella continued to accuse her subtly of leading her brother on and having designs on him.\n\nIsabella was clearly jealous of Catherine going to Northanger, but she put on quite a convincing act about being heartfelt. She promised to write Catherine quite a bit. She ended up not writing at all.\n\nIsabella continued to engage in flirtation with Frederick Tilney, hoping that he would come to love her enough to ask to marry her. Isabella was likely caught with Tilney to make James Morland break off the marriage and send a missive to Catherine telling his sister what transpired. They parted with mutual consent, and Isabella hoped that Frederick would ask to marry her.\n\nWhen it became clear that Captain Tilney had no interest in making an offer for Isabella, she attempted to reconcile her relationship with the Morland family by going to Catherine first, as Catherine had always been easy to manipulate. She blamed her straying affections on Frederick, mostly, and asked for Catherine to put in a good word for her to James Morland.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Isabella_Thorpe"}}

She developed an understanding with her maternal first cousin, Charles Hayter, who was a scholar and a gentleman. Her father, while still knowing that Henrietta could do far better than Charles Hayter, blessed the match anyway as long as it would bring his daughter happiness. Upon the arrival of Captain Wentworth, however, Charles Hayter was forgotten. She and Louisa fell a bit in love with the former naval captain, who was handsome and rich. Mary Musgrove saw this as a benefit for as well, as she thought a marriage between her sister-in-law and a poorer cousin would bring down people's opinions of herself and her husband as well. Charles Musgrove disagreed with Mary, mostly because he was fond of his cousin. Although there wasn't a lot of money or property for Henrietta in the match, there was an estate and a fertile farm. He thought that a match between Henrietta and Charles Hayter would be good, although slightly lowering. Therefore, he thought Louisa should marry Captain Wentworth, and Henrietta should marry Charles Hayter.\n\nAnne Elliot noticed that although the Musgrove sisters were in thrall of Captain Wentworth, he did not seem to share their regard. Henrietta fancied herself divided between Wentworth and Hayter and relished it. After a while, Charles Hayter gave up, quitting Uppercross and going back to his studies.\n\nHenrietta realized, however, that she was still in love with Charles Hayter and relinquished Frederick Wentworth to her sister. During a walk, her brother and she maneuvered the bunch so they would run onto Winthrop, the estate owned by her uncle and aunt. Henrietta renewed the romance with her cousin and came back to the group quite happy.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Henrietta_Musgrove"}}

When Maria's elder sister got married to Mr. Norris, he offered his brother-in-law the parish at Mansfield. When his wife's other sister, Fanny, married a man for love even though he had nothing else to recommend him, he was about to send help and advice when a rift broke the sisters. His wife cut her sister out of her life, and so did Mrs. Norris after writing her a very angry letter.\n\nThey had no news from Mrs. Price for 11 long years, until they received a letter from her asking for help and advice. Sir Thomas was very affable and offered career advice for the boys, his nephews. Lady Bertram sent money and baby-linens for Mrs. Price's ninth child. Peace was officially restored.\n\nMrs. Norris introduced the idea of bringing her sister's second child and first daughter, ten year old Fanny Price to Mansfield, in order to offer her education and to further help her poor sister. Sir Thomas, at first, was opposed to the idea, but was soon convinced. He did say that if Fanny proved unteachable and unmannerly, they would send her back. When Fanny arrived, she was in awe and shock. Sir Thomas tried to make her feel at ease but failed; Lady Bertram was kind and installed herself as her young niece's favorite. The girl proved to be kind and gentle, which meant that the Bertrams did not need to send her away for possible vulgarity.\n\nSir Thomas and Lady Bertram provided for Fanny's education. She shared Miss Lee, the governess, with her female cousins Maria and Julia. Sir Thomas continued to send help to Mrs. Price and her family, showing his further generosity to his in-laws.\n\nSir Thomas's eldest son and heir, Thomas became guilty of overspending and extravagance in London. His debts forced his father to sell the parsonage that should have been Edmund's. Sir Thomas was incredibly disappointed, and did not hesitate to tell his eldest son that. The parsonage passed to Dr. Grant instead.\n\nSir Thomas and his eldest son traveled for Antigua, where Sir Thomas owned an estate that was not doing so well. It became necessary for them to go in order to go over the accounts or else the Bertrams would lose a lot more than just the parsonage. Before they left, Sir Thomas told Fanny Price that her elder brother would probably not find her all that different than how she was when she was 10. After Sir Thomas and Tom had gone, a letter came later saying they arrived safely in Antigua. While he was away Mrs. Norris played matchmaker and brought an engagement between Maria and James Rushworth, a wealthy gentleman with £12,000 per year. The family had to write to Sir Thomas abroad to ask his consent, and he was ultimately pleased by so good a match.\n\nSir Thomas was supposed to return the September of that year, but he decided to stay, as he had not concluded his business.

Sir Walter had plans to marry her to his heir presumptive, William Elliot, whom he invited to Kellynch Hall. William put off coming over and over again, and finally they heard that he had married a wealthy heiress and would not be visiting.

She invited Mrs. Clay along with her, which angered Lady Russell, who thought that Mrs. Clay, who was not even a gentlewoman, was being treated with more gentility than Elizabeth's own sister, Anne.\n\nSir Walter and Elizabeth rented a luxurious home on Camden-place, a very swanky part of Bath.

The Elliots can claim a familial connection to her and her daughter, and they were wondering how to go about doing that. Upon the dowager viscountess's arrival, they immediately called at her rented home on Laura-place, another fashionable residential area. Elizabeth and her father were excited and impressed with their new acquaintances; Anne was not. Elizabeth and Sir Walter continued to visit the Dalrymples on Laura-place nearly every day. They criticized Anne when they heard that she had visited her old governess as opposed to coming with them to pursue an acquaintance with a peeress. Elizabeth very snobbily asked what Lady Russell thought about that.

She is the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, a baronet; and the late Lady Elliot. Anne was born August 9th in 1787. She has two other sisters, one older, Elizabeth; and one younger, Mary Musgrove. She is her father's least favorite child, since he does not think her of very much beauty or consequence, and thus not likely to marry high enough to bring pride to the Elliot family. She is, however, the favorite of her late mother's best friend, Lady Russell. Anne is also Lady Russell's goddaughter.","Anne is described to have an elegance of mind and sweetness of character that reminded her godmother, Lady Russell, of the late Lady Elliot. To Lady Russell, Anne was her favorite of the Elliot girls.","Anne and Frederick had a whirlwind romance in 1806. When she broke it off, he was angered with her. He left his mark on her, and she never moved her affections to anyone else. She also lost a lot of her beauty and vivaciousness due to heartbreak.","Like most of her family, she was taken in by William Elliot when he came to reconcile with them in Bath, although she was slightly suspicious of his interest in them at first, since before he showed the opposite of interest in any of them. She was gratified to find that he was an excellent conversationalist, well-educated, and that he shared his views on quite a few things that annoyed her, including Mrs. Clay, whom she suspected was going after her father.","The woman was her governess during a very hard time of her life after her mother died. Mrs. Smith brought Anne's happiness back and helped her get over her melancholy and misery. This made it so Mrs. Smith could never be forgotten or ignored, even when the woman was poor. Anne made sure to visit her while in Bath, renewing their friendship. Mrs. Smith shared what she knew of the people in Bath and was even the woman who alerted Anne of William Elliot's dastardly past and even more dastardly intentions for the future.","She and her father do not get along, mostly due to her past involving Captain Wentworth in 1806. She is her father's least favorite daughter, and he even favors non-family members over her. Not even he can deny, though, that she is sensible, even if he does dislike her.","Since her mother's death, Lady Russell has become a surrogate mother of sorts for Anne. As the lady is extremely well-read and well-educated, she nurtured Anne's education and intelligence. She wants the best for Anne, which is why she did not like the idea of Anne marrying a man with no fortune nor breeding. What she wants most for Anne is someone who is well-educated and who will nurture intelligence in Anne as a future wife.","Anne does not get along with Elizabeth, although they tolerate each other. She is welcomed more by Mary, but sometimes Mary is intolerable. Both of her sisters have what the Musgroves\u2014Mary's in-laws\u2014refer to as \"Elliot pride\". This means looking down at others for inferior birth, as well as being generally snobbish and vain."],"name":"Anne Elliot","description":"In 1806, Frederick Wentworth, a naval captain, took up residence at Monkford estate, the house of which his brother was curate. Anne developed a strong affection for him, and he for her. He was brilliant and she absolutely adored his sense of humor and his wit. Her father, however, did not approve, and even saw the connection as degrading due to his lack of fortune and lower status in the world. Sir Walter developed a dislike for his middle daughter because he thought she was overlooking her duty to the family. Even Lady Russell, who favored Anne over the other Elliot sisters, took Sir Walter's side in this instance. If it were only her father who protested the match, Anne would've gone through with it; but she harbored a deep love for her godmother and she took their advice in breaking it off with Wentworth. The captain was deeply hurt and felt ill-used, and he left Monkford for the navy again. He left his mark on Anne though, who lost her beauty due to heartbreak, and she never replaced him with another man.\n\nSir Walter fell into a lot of debt due to overspending, as there was no Lady Elliot to bring him back from his lack of frugality. Mr. Shepherd, her father's lawyer and adviser, told him that he should remove the family from Kellynch. Sir Walter originally wished to go to London, but Shepherd and Lady Russell feared that he would resort to overspending in the sumptuous city and convinced him to go to Bath instead.\n\nIn the meantime, the Elliots put Kellynch up for rent. The Crofts decided to take it, much to Anne's dismay, as Mrs. Croft is Captain Wentworth's sister. She soon learned that Captain Wentworth was to stay with his sister and brother-in-law at Kellynch while she stayed with her younger sister and her husband's family at Uppercross, which was unsettling for her.\n\nAnne was nervous to see Captain Wentworth, who, after reuniting with Anne, told Henrietta Musgrove that Anne was so altered in appearance that he wouldn't have known her. Mary Musgrove said this was ungallant, and at first Anne was dismayed, but then the words sobered her nerves and agitation and made her happier. They were later thrown into quite a few dinners and events together, but things remained awkward. They said so few things to each other, beyond what was required of basic civility. This kind of shocked Anne, who remembered a time when it would be difficult to get them to stop speaking to each other.\n\nIn the subsequent days, Wentworth spent a lot of time at Uppercross, where he received undying interest and admiration from Louisa and Henrietta Musgrove, not to mention the Miss Hayters. This was painful for Anne, since he only treated her with cold civility and talked more with the Miss Musgroves and the Miss Hayters. It was clear that he did not share her regard for him. Anne spent those days observing who would be best for Wentworth, and who he would choose for a wife. She knew that Henrietta was the prettier of the two, but that Louisa had a certain vitality that might attract him. She was distressed that she did not know his preferences as she had used to. Mary thought it would be capital if Wentworth was made a baronet for his heroics and then he would be \"Sir Frederick\" and Henrietta \"Lady Wentworth\". Mary also wanted Henrietta to be the one he was interested in to end Charles Hayter's suit, as she had inherited her father's snobbery.\n\nAnne went to Bath with Lady Russell to stay with her father and sister in their fashionable rented house on Camden-place. Her father and sister regaled her with news of William Elliot, her father's formerly wayward heir who wanted to make amends. Mr. Elliot had been introducing them to the cream of Bath society, which Sir Walter and Elizabeth appreciated. It was also hinted that William might have lingering feelings for Elizabeth, a notion that Mrs. Clay encouraged. Anne started to notice that Mrs. Clay was worming her way into Sir Walter's affections, but was relieved to see that Sir Walter did not love the woman.\n\nAnne started a friendship with her distant cousin, the heir, who made himself very agreeable. She was pleased that they could have good conversation, which she valued over anything. She did not like Lady Dalrymple, another relation. However, the lady was a dowager viscountess which made her instantly likable to her father and sister, both of whom were obsessed with status. While her family continued to call at the dowager's rental home on Laura-place, Anne visited Mrs. Smith, her old governess.\n\nAnne heard in a letter from Mary that Louisa Musgrove had turned her favor from Wentworth to Captain Benwick. Anne was a bit happy about this because it leaves Wentworth single. She ran into Wentworth in Bath and he offered himself as an escort in the rain, as he had an umbrella. He was also invited to the concert hosted by Lady Dalrymple. She became alerted to William Elliot's growing affection for her, which made her very uncomfortable. Later, she learned how horrible William was from Mrs. Smith, who told her all about how the man ruined and impoverished her late husband.\n\nAfter Anne decided to refuse William Elliot if he asked for her hand, Wentworth gave her a love letter personally and entreated her to read it. She rekindled her love and affection with Wentworth, and this time he was successful when he asked her father for her hand in marriage. They even helped Mrs. Smith regain her lost lands in the West Indies.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anne_Elliot"}}

She, thinking he would be coming just as a friend and not as a suitor, encouraged his visit and said that company is always quite fun to have around. It is believed that either Isabella or John let this slip to the Tilneys in order to put off Henry Tilney from pursuing Catherine.\n\nWhen it became known to the Thorpes that the Morlands were not as wealthy as they thought, John distanced himself from Catherine, and Isabella accused her of leading two men on\u2014which she was not.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/John_Thorpe"}}

He had £5,000 a year, a huge sum. This made him an attractive marriage prospect for the Bennet girls, as proclaimed by Mrs. Bennet, who had the news from Mrs. Long. Bingley was immediate called upon by members of the village who were most interested in marrying off daughters, like Mr. Bennet and Sir William Lucas. Mr. Bingley brought his two sisters and brother-in-law to Netherfield, and was also joined by Fitzwilliam Darcy, one of his closest friends.\n\nBingley first made acquaintance with the Bennet sisters during a public ball at Meryton, and he was very taken with Jane. Bingley was rather aghast at the aloofness of his friend Mr. Darcy, and how he would refuse to dance with anyone but Bingley's sisters, Caroline and Louisa.\n\nHe was pleased with his neighbors, and he said he never met pleasanter people or prettier women in his life, and that there was a promising lack of stiffness and snobbery. This is in direct contrast to Mr. Darcy, however, who saw a collection of people in whom there was little beauty, and no fashion, where the only 'handsome' girl was Jane Bennet. Both Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst agreed with him, but thought Jane a sweet girl, thinking nothing of it. Mr. Bingley saw this as encouragement and a commendation.\n\nWhen Jane caught cold due to riding through the rain for a visit with his sisters, Mr. Bingley generously gave her a room. He was very anxious about her health, and Elizabeth thought more of him for it.\n\nMr. Bingley had been fostering a tendresse' for Miss Bennet. His sisters, horrified at the thought of being connected to the Bennet family by marriage, convinced him to leave Hertfordshire. He had every intention of returning, but Mr. Darcy did everything he could to dissuade his friend from such an engagement. He concealed information about Jane being in London. Mostly, Mr. Darcy did it because he believed Jane to be indifferent, which would cause Bingley harm if he actually married her.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Charles_Bingley"}}

Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters packed up what little furniture and belongings they had left, and departed.\n\nSince Mrs. Dashwood rarely saved money and only had £500 a year, they couldn't make a lot of the alterations they wanted to and were wise enough to live with the house as it was.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mrs._Dashwood"}}

His favorite daughter Elizabeth, ran the estate since the death of her mother, but shared her father's lack of financial sense.\n\nHis attorney, Mr. Shepherd, and his late wife's friend Lady Russell, urged the Elliot family to spend time away from Kellynch. It was between London, Bath, and the country. Sir Walter had been aiming for London, but Shepherd and Lady Russell convinced him it should be Bath.\n\nSir Walter was apprehensive at first about a naval officer and his wife renting Kellynch. As he was all about appearances, he was more concerned with the physical beauty of his renters as well as their manners and breeding. When he met Admiral Croft, he was actually quite pleased, and declared the admiral one of the best-looking naval officers he had ever seen. When he and Elizabeth moved to Bath for the season, they brought along Mrs. Clay, Elizabeth's friend. This annoyed Lady Russell, who felt that Anne was being ignored for the sake of a lawyer's daughter.\n\nSir Walter rented a townhouse on Camden-place, a fashionable part of Bath. Mrs. Clay stayed with them throughout the whole time, and Sir Walter grew to like her. While Anne was staying at Uppercross with the Musgroves and Lady Russell was away, William Elliot came to call at the Bath townhouse. He was apologetic and looking to reconcile with the family. Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Mrs. Clay thought he was the most genial man with very impeccable manners and wealth. His money came from his late first wife, Mrs. William Elliot, who was very plumply dowered. The late Mrs. Elliot left William with a large fortune.\n\nHe was pleased when it seemed like William and Elizabeth were growing fond of each other, as he always knew would be proper. Anne was worried to see that Mrs. Clay might have designs on her father, and he thought quite well of the woman, considering she was not a gentlewoman.\n\nSir Walter and his eldest daughter were ecstatic about the arrival of Lady Dalrymple, a dowager viscountess, and her daughter. Sir Walter used to converse with the late Lord Dalrymple, a cousin of his, before the man's death. A misunderstanding led to the estrangement between the two houses. Sir Walter and Elizabeth annoyed Anne by forever mentioning and namedropping the Dalrymples, doing anything they could to alert others and themselves to the family connection. They visited the Dalrymples at their rented house on Laura-place to begin the acquaintance. They were successful and they visited Lady Dalrymple and her daughter quite a bit after that. When Sir Walter heard that Anne visited her former governess instead of coming with them to visit Lady Dalrymple, he became immensely snobby and criticized the poor woman. Anne withheld from pointing out the similarity between her visiting Mrs. Smith, and their putting up Mrs. Clay.\n\nThe Elliots were invited to a concert hosted by Lady Dalrymple. They were the first ones there\u2014quite unfashionable\u2014and took their places in the octagon room to wait for Lady Dalrymple. Sir Walter noticed Frederick Wentworth, the man whom he had previously forbidden from marrying Anne, and thought him quite a genial man now\u2014perhaps because of his newly acquired wealth.\n\nWentworth asked for Sir Walter's consent in proposing to his daughter, and this time the notion was greeted with more civility, as Wentworth was no longer a nobody. Mrs. Clay ran away with William Elliot, showing her true colors to Sir Walter and Elizabeth, both of whom were surprised at how she deceived them.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/janeausten.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sir_Walter_Elliot"}}

She was raised primarily by her beloved governess, Miss Taylor, for sixteen years until Miss Taylor married Mr. Weston..","She is described in the novel's opening sentence as \"handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and a happy disposition.\" Jane Austen, while writing the novel, called Emma \"a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\" Emma is the richest of Austen's heroines.","Emma is an independently wealthy woman who lives with her aging father in the English countryside near the village of Highbury. The novel concerns her attempts to be a matchmaker among her acquaintances and her own romantic misadventures.","Due to his attachment to Emma, Mr Knightley has disliked Frank Churchill (unconsciously labeling him as competition) even before he met Frank, and remains doubtful of him even when everyone else indulges the younger man. It is also his jealousy of Frank that causes Mr Knightley to acknowledge his romantic feelings for Emma. Although he is mostly rational, he can also act more impulsively at the cause of Emma, such as making a sudden visit to London and returning in an equally unexpected manner to propose to her. Emma, too, gradually realizes her feelings for him due to her jealousy first of Jane Fairfax and later of Harriet Smith."],"name":"Emma Woodhouse","description":"Emma often behaves in a frivolous or selfish way, and shows a lack of consideration for her friends and neighbours. She carelessly manipulates the life of her friend Harriet Smith, neglects her acquaintance Jane Fairfax, and insults the poor and dependent Miss Bates. However, her friends, especially Mrs Weston and George Knightley, see potential in her to improve herself and become a good person.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Emma_Woodhouse"}}
