Thus, Superman is, in a way, indirectly posthumously responsible for the formation of not only the Justice League, but also the Suicide Squad.","Kal-El was born on February 29, 1980, on the faraway planet Krypton to Jor-El, a scientist in the Kryptonian Thinker Guild, and his wife Lara Lor-Van in the wake of a military coup d\u2019état led by his father's lifelong friend and commander in the Kryptonian Warrior Guild, General Dru-Zod. When he made his first cries, they were heard by some Rondors grazing near the House of El Citadel.","The starship emerged near to the gas giant planet Saturn, and promptly made its way to Earth, flying right by the Moon in the process. It landed undetected in the rural town of Smallville, Kansas, where it was found by Jonathan Kent, a local farmer, and Martha Clark-Kent, a diner waitress. The childless couple promptly adopted the infant Kal-El inside, giving him the name of \"Clark Joseph Kent\" (combining Martha's maiden surname with Jonathan's) and hiding his true origins from others and even Clark himself for most of his childhood.","Walking around the enormous ship he realized the key Jonathan gave him as a child, was of the same technology and plugs it into a port.","Once aboard the Black Zero starship, Kal-El came face to face with General Zod, who had him tied down, as the atmosphere aboard was replicating Krypton's, leaving Kal-El practically helpless, due to it rendering him unable to access his stores of solar energy. Zod's leading scientist Jax-Ur then proceeded to take some of Kal-El's blood, before Zod exposed him to mental probing.","Kal-El's super hearing alerted him to General Zod, already at Kent Farm and threatening Martha. He flew over and attacked Zod. They subsequently collided into a gas station, which exploded. Zod's breather mask was damaged and all his senses overwhelmed him causing him to collapse. Faora and Nam-Ek followed and confronted Kal-El, with the pair outnumbering him, beating him to the ground and cautioning him that he won\u2019t prevail.","While Superman flies back, Colonel Hardy and Lois are under attack from General Zod, the latter attempting to shoot their plane out of the sky with the Fortress of Solitude. Superman, however, returns right in time to collide with the Fortress (incapacitating it's targeting systems) and destroy its Genesis Chamber, much to Zod' dismay. The Fortress is thus swiftly brought down onto the ground in Metropolis, colliding with many skyscrapers in the process. Meanwhile, thanks to the efforts of Colonel Hardy and Dr. Hamilton, the Phantom Drive of Superman's infant starship is activated, and the plane successfully collides with the Black Zero, creating a temporary Phantom Zone energy singularity that sucks in the Black Zero and the plane.","The battle intensified once Zod managed to master his heat vision and Superman struggled to counter the Kryptonian's superior experience and skill in honing his abilities. Zod efficiently gained the upper hand in the fight, before ripping off his armor and finally grasping his flying ability, now on even footing with Superman.","Superman flew back home to Martha in Smallville. He was consoled by her, as Martha was alright, with only some damage to her house. Clark later got a job as a junior reporter at the Daily Planet newspaper in Metropolis, on the recommendation of Lois. Upon arriving at his first day at work, Clark chose to wear a pair of glasses in an attempt to conceal his identity as \"Superman\", with only Lois recognizing and promptly welcoming him to \"the Planet\" (a clever pun that only both of them understood).","In his first days of openly being a superhero, Superman took to dealing with natural disasters (notably the wildfires in the home forests of the state of Senator Stearns, that had almost claimed hundreds of lives), crime and humanitarian missions, but he notably avoided getting involved in controversial political disputes, such as wars between the nations of Earth.","At the same time, a number of survivalist militias also emerge, who believe Superman to be the advance scout for a future, larger alien invasion of Earth. Businessman Lex Luthor, whose prolific philanthropic efforts made some claim that he is as much a hero to Metropolis as Superman, claimed that the alien superhero is a figure too mysterious and controversial for him to be a good comparison, but in light of Superman's debut, Lex claims that recognizing the importance of the \"ordinary\" citizens of Metropolis (such as rescue workers, first responders, and countless ordinary citizens, who also helped save others in the Battle of Metropolis) has become more important than ever. Thus, US Senator Finch believed that before an ultimate decision regarding Superman is made, the issue of his existence must be approached objectively, and she, therefore, advocated for the creation of a committee to study and learn more about Superman.","One day, Lois and Clark swiftly exit the Daily Planet newsroom, as Lois heads off to expose the corrupt Hanford Technologies CEO Mark Hanford (who had been illegally profiting from the sale of Kryptonian weapons on the black market), while Clark heads off to help with floods in Bangladesh as Superman, warning Lois to be safe in his absence.","Some time later, Superman saves a runaway train full of passengers. As he uncouples the cars, he runs out of track and has to settle the front cars on the desert by lifting them up. Shortly thereafter, video footage of the event is recorded, and studied by Professor Garcia, after which he discusses it with a woman named Teri and another man. Garcia goes out of his way to argue that Superman tries to save lives, with the superhero having done so even in the infamous Battle of Metropolis. Garcia also defends Superman's decision to avoid getting involved in wars, as intervening in political disputes (such as unilaterally disarming a country's military) could actually make the situation worse. Teri appears to agree with the professor, but as it turns out, she is only speaking the words spoken to her through an earpiece by Lex Luthor.","Some time later, Clark took a school class from Metropolis on a school trip to S.T.A.R. Labs Metropolis branch. At the facility, the S.T.A.R. Labs team display their Tachyon Transfer technology, that can send objects vast distances across space. They proceed to open the portal, but grotesque alien creatures, called the Ko'erst came through. They were controlling Dr. Forsythe to keep it open, so that they could invade Earth. Clark managed to swiftly leave in the confusion, and return as Superman, after which he managed to swiftly overpower and tie up the Ko'erst, before they were sent back through to their home world.","Some time later still, Superman, having learned of criminals attempting to steal Kryptonian technology from the Wayne Enterprises Research & Development Facility, promptly arrives and confronts them. While they initially make him retreat with Kryptonian plasma rifles (due to Superman's unwillingness to hurt them), Bruce Wayne gets a hold of a Kryptonian Signal Jammer, and utilizes it at a high frequency to incapacitate them all, though Superman recovers much quicker than the criminals, and thus, he manages to hand them over to the Metropolis Police Department, though not before confiscating the stolen Kryptonian tech.","This incident generates quite a bit of controversy throughout the world, with Senator Finch and her committee (responsible for studying Superman), after interviewing Nairomian Kahina Ziri (actually an actress hired and blackmailed into testifying by Lex Luthor), hold Superman responsible for what occurred in the North African desert. However, Kahina pretends to take little solace from this, claiming that the US government would never be able to force Superman to answer to them, since he seemingly answers to no one, not even to God.","Returning home to his and Lois' apartment, Clark sees Lois in the bathtub and said he wanted to surprise her by cooking up something. When the subject shifts to the controversy surrounding his actions in Nairomi, Clark makes it clear that he is unconcerned, as Lois could have been killed; also adding that he didn't murder anyone. When Lois questions if whether or not it is possible for him to love her and be Superman, he responds by giving her one of the roses he bought and getting into the bathtub with her despite being fully-clothed; kissing her passionately before his glasses come off. Clark then proceeds to take off his shirt.","On the morning news, while cooking, Clark hears Nairomian Kahina Ziri being interviewed regarding Superman, and she states that had Superman been in her presence she would ask him how he decides: \"which lives count, and which ones do not?\" Clark is visibly uncomfortable at the accusation.  Later that same day, Clark is assigned by Perry to travel to Gotham City and cover the Metropolis vs Gotham football game (being given the headline \"Underdog Dreams Dashed - 10 Yards Between Gotham and Glory\") when the news reports on Wallace Keefe vandalizing the Superman Statue by spray-painting the words \"False God\" in red on the chest before he is arrested. Clark is visibly saddened about this hate crime. Perry, while also quite upset, gives Jenny the headline \"End of Love Affair With Man In the Sky?\" Before Clark departs, Perry advises the former to watch himself in Gotham, due to the city's high crime rate.","He first visits Kahina Ziri's apartment complex, but is told by her neighbors (who initially mistake the reporter for a police officer) that she  left some time ago. One of the neighbors, an old man, claims that Kahina made the right choice by leaving Gotham, and recommends that Clark leave soon as well before the night, unless Clark wishes to run into the infamous Batman, who, according to the old man, is imbued with \"a new kind of mean\". Kahina's other neighbor, however, adamantly disagrees, stating that Batman should be feared only by those to have a reason to. Dismayed at this news of brutal terror-based vigilantism, Clark heads back.","At a staff meeting shortly after his return from Gotham, Clark begins his pursuit of Batman by bringing up his repeated targets in the poor areas of Gotham and alliance with the local GCPD, which earns him mockery from Perry, who also asks if whether or not he began work on the football story he assigned him to. Clark insists that this story is worth printing as it shows that the common civilian matters and that the press has zero tolerance for Batman and other vigilantes, but Perry retorts by saying \u201Cthe American conscience died with Robert, Martin, and John\u201D. At that point, Lois enters the meeting, displaying a bullet found in Nairobi, letting Perry know that she intended to fly to Washington DC to further investigate, and briefly making eye contact with Clark.","While observing other arriving guests at Luthor's fundraiser, Clark has his attention swiftly attracted by Gotham City billionaire Bruce Wayne, just as the later exits his car.","Finally, Senator June Finch is interviewed on the matter, with her interviewer wondering aloud if it is really surprising that Superman, as the most powerful man in the world, is viewed as a figure of controversy. He proceeds to ask her if she would be personally comfortable with saying to a grieving parent, that Superman could have saved their child, but but couldn't because the government had not wanted him to act. Finch admits that while Superman's engagement in state-level interventions should be cause for concern, she proceeds to explain that the problem is not Superman's actions, but that he should not be carrying them out unilaterally. This makes her interviewer conclude by saying that the overall question is in fact, \u201Cmust there be a Superman?\u201D; to which she simply replies that \u201Cthere is\u201D. Clark himself sees this interview on television, and is visibly dismayed, feeling more unsure of his place than before.","The next day at work, Clark comes across an online page of a Gotham Free Press article, on how being branded by Batman is a death sentence among Gotham City prison inmates, with there having been 18 reports of people getting branded with \"bat-brands\" by the ruthless vigilante. An angry and frustrated Clark is determined to take active initiative.","Shortly thereafter, Clark is confronted by Perry, who is furious with him for having not covered the Metropolis football match or Lex Luthor's fundraiser for the Metropolis Library. Clark argues by saying that the press has the responsibility of showing integrity and exposing Batman for the criminal that he is, bringing up the fact that the Daily Planet had an upstanding reputation for displaying such character at its foundation. Perry responds by mocking Clark\u2019s values, saying that \u201Cit\u2019s not 1938\u201D and life is no longer simple enough for someone like Clark to be admired for upstanding character alone; therefore, he is ordered to cease his pursuit of Batman, as no one will find such a thing interesting. Clark is agitated, but undeterred.","An infuriated Clark thus decides to take a more direct approach to dealing with Batman, this time as Superman.","That evening, while Batman was intercepting Lex Luthor's men transporting Kryptonite, Superman interrupted the chase, damaging the Batmobile after Batman tried running him down, and again when Superman tore the doors off. With Cesar Santos' death (and subsequent orphaning of the latter's son) being the last straw, Superman threatens the Dark Knight, warning him to give up his crusade, to ignore the Bat-Signal the next time it lights up, and that he should consider Superman's warning mercy. As he turned to leave, Batman countered with a threat of his own, expressing his determination to make the godlike alien \"bleed\". Not impressed with Batman's threat, Superman flew off, while Batman promptly drove back to the Batcave in the damaged Batmobile.","While the rest of the world is still busy debating on \"The Superman Question\", Clark returns home to Smallville to visit his mother Martha. There, she advises him that either way, he shouldn't be concerned with what others think of him, assures him that he is neither a threat, nor a killer, and that ultimately, he doesn't owe planet Earth a thing.  Despite much media speculation to the contrary, Superman arrives to speak and answer at Senator Finch's committee, at the US Capitol in Washington DC. While there are notably quite a few anti-Superman protesters gathered there (with banners labelled \"SuperDeath\", \"Thanks for the \"Help\"!\", \"Earth Belongs to Humans\", \"God Hates Aliens\" and \"Aliens Doom Nations\", a House of El glyph with a Nazi swastika, as well as an alien-shaped head on a pole), Lois stands there as well, for additional support. The trial is also attended by Lex Luthor's personal assistant, Mercy Graves. Right before the trial, Kahina Ziri approaches Senator Finch, revealing herself to be an actress that Lex had hired to lie, so Finch resolves to mention this in the trial as well, intending to clear his name. When Superman enters, Finch starts out by pointing out to him a witness\/victim of Superman's actions, Wallace Keefe, who lost his legs during the Black Zero Event. After suddenly noticing a distasteful note left for her by Lex Luthor (a jar of urine, labelled \"Granny's Peach Tea\"), a startled Finch stops in mid-speech, before a bomb (hidden inside Keefe's lead-lined wheelchair by Lex) explodes, killing her, Graves, Keefe, and everyone else present, except for the invulnerable, but mortified Superman.","That evening, Superman flew back to his and Lois' apartment and spoke to her on the balcony. While Lois assured him that he was not to blame and was about to tell him of Lex Luthor's involvement (having learned it from S.T.A.R. Labs weapons and ballistics specialist Jenet Klyburn), Superman insisted that he hadn't been able to prevent the bombing because he hadn't been looking for a potential bomb in the first place. Now, mortified at how his actions had so far consistently lead to horrible consequences, Clark claims that the whole idea of \"Superman\" had never even been real in the first place, with it only ever being \"the dream of a farmer from Kansas.\" Lois insisted that this \"dream\" is all that most people have to give them hope, and she pointed to his House of El glyph, stating that it still means something. However, Clark sadly replies that while it did on Krypton, that world no longer exists, and he then promptly flies off, into self-imposed exile. Meanwhile, in the news, many are suspecting that Superman might have been involved in letting the Capitol bombing happen, so a mob of protesters assembles outside the building's wreckage, burning a large ragdoll of Superman, while chanting in outrage.  Superman flies to the faraway mountains, dons civilian clothing, and hikes up the snow-covered slope. He passes some people, with an old man remarking (in Mexican Spanish) that since Clark knows that the mountain he's climbing isn't passable, the logical conclusion is that Clark has come to die.","When Superman attempts to refuse, Lex reveals that the former's mother, Martha Kent, is held in captivity in a top-secret location by Knyazev (producing several photos of a horrified tied up Martha as proof). An incredibly furious Superman seems ready to destroy Lex with his heat vision, but the latter says that if Superman attempts to kill him or fly away, Martha will be burned alive, and the only way for Superman to save her, is to fly to Gotham City, fight and kill Batman in a vicious duel to the death, and subsequently bring the vigilante's head to Lex. An incredibly furious Superman is left with no choice but to comply with Lex's orders, and flies off, much to the delight of Lex.","Batman recovers from the shock and gets to his feet, while Superman rolls over helplessly, engulfed by the toxic mist. Batman wrenches a sink basin from its porcelain pedestal and brings it down hard on the back of Superman's head, momentarily knocking him unconscious.","Aware of his impending death, Superman implores Batman to save \"Martha\". Batman, confused and shocked by this (as \"Martha\" was the name of his own late mother), pauses his killing blow, and yells at Superman, demanding to know why the latter had uttered that name. At that moment, Lois finally arrives, and explains to Batman that it is the name of Superman's mother. Batman then realizes his own hypocrisy - that he has allowed Lex Luthor to twist his anger from the Black Zero Event and turn him into the very monster he swore to fight. Hence, Batman hurls the spear away in disgust, horrified at what he had almost become, and he is now prepared to help Superman, whom he now better understands, while also redeeming himself in his own eyes in the process.","Having partially recovered from the Kryptonite gas and exposure, Superman flies to the Fortress of Solitude and smashes through the starship's hull to face Lex Luthor, letting the latter know that Martha is safe, Batman is now an ally, and that Lex had lost. The malevolent supergenius, however was unfazed by the news of his failed plan, claims not to know how to lose, and he is quick to finally reveal his far more grandiose and extreme contingency plan - a massive hybrid Kryptonian monster grown from General Zod's corpse and Lex's blood (in an ancient Kryptonian ritual, long forbidden by the Law Council), Superman's \"Doomsday\". Lex gleefully added that now Superman was \"as good as dead\".","In desperation, Superman tackles Doomsday and takes him into space. The US President intends to shoot the alien monster down with a megaton nuke , and it is carried out, despite the protests of Calvin Swanwick. Superman defiantly holds Doomsday in place as he sees the missile approach, determined to have the monster destroyed. The resulting explosion is so gigantic, that Batman can clearly see it from Earth's surface.","In the meantime, Superman, appearing undead, and withered, is floating in space being extremely weakened by the nuclear missile blast that knocked him out completely.","Superman and a recently arrived Wonder Woman then proceed to jointly attack Doomsday in tandem, while Batman tries to expose the monster to Kryptonite, which would exploit its only known vulnerability. Wonder Woman soon manages to cut off the monster's right arm, but that only results in a sharp bony protrusion growing back in its place.   In the meantime, Lois is in Gotham City, trying to retrieve the Kryptonite spear from underwater. Superman is able to hear her drowning, and flies off to rescue her, retrieving the spear in the process, while Wonder Woman manages to temporarily restrain Doomsday with her indestructible lasso. Superman sees that the only way to stop Doomsday will end up putting his life at risk, since brute force alone had been proven ineffective. Hence, he says a tender goodbye to Lois with a kiss, before taking hold of the spear and flying back to the battle scene, exposed to the substance himself in the process, though he manages to temporarily bypass the Kryptonite's weakening and superpower negation effects with a tremendous amount of willpower and determination.","A weakened Superman returns back to the battle and stabs Doomsday with the Kryptonite spear, causing more electrical energy than ever before to pour out of Doomsday, making Wonder Woman momentarily lose her footing. This allowed Doomsday to slip out of the Lasso of Truth binding him, and plunge his bony arm protrusion into Superman's chest. Superman, however, is undeterred by his impending death, and defiantly fights against the incredible pain, plunging the spear deeper into Doomsday's chest with his last ounce of strength, as well as letting the monster's bony protrusion sink deeper into his own chest, thereby allowing the spear to pierce Doomsday's body completely. The two give one final joint bellow of agony, before their lifeless bodies hit the ground.","Perry White prints a special edition of the Daily Planet paper in honor of Superman and his efforts (still thankful to the superhero for saving him during the Black Zero Event), headlining it \"Superman Dead: Night of Terror, Morning of Loss\".","Even after his death, Superman still continues to have a profound impact on the world - his alien heritage and usage of his powers for selfless heroism make Superman a beacon of hope and inspiration for metahumans like the Flash, inducing them to also more openly use their powers and come out into the light, with the Flash notably apprehending the notorious bank robber Captain Boomerang as a result. Humans were also significantly impacted, with a vendor on the street exemplifying their deep posthumous respect for Superman - he is seen selling black and blue T-shirts with the House of El glyph on their chests, labelled \"Superman\" on the front, and \"remember\" on the back (thus extolling the hero's selfless sacrifice).","Ultimately, after getting saved by her Suicide Squad from the clutches of Enchantress and her army, Amanda Waller also proves herself a useful situational ally for Batman, with her helping him honor Superman's sacrifice and establish the Justice League by giving him files on the specific metahumans that he requested (including Aquaman and the Flash), in exchange for the Dark Knight promising her to take care of the rumors following the aftermath of the calamitous mystical events in Midway City.","To be added","Batman recuperates chained up in the bunker with his few remaining Insurgent allies, eyeing them helplessly. Superman himself then lands in the bunker, and his Regime Stormtroopers reverently kneel before their leader. He approaches Batman, swiftly murdering the other Insurgency members with his heat vision. Superman then unmasks the horrified and visibly scared vigilante. He expresses his anger at Bruce for letting \"her\" die, as she was \"his world\". Superman gives Batman one final sinister sneer, and ruthlessly kills him by tearing Batman's heart from his chest, thereby ending the Injustice War."],"name":"Superman","description":"Superman is exceptionally kind-hearted, possessing a strong sense of justice, honor, honesty\/truthfulness, patriotism, and selfless benevolence. Indeed, Jor-El foresaw how his son would become \"an ideal\" for humanity to strive towards, and even Batman, who initially had his doubts, later claimed that Superman is a \"beacon to the world\", one who doesn't just save people, but also \"made them see the best parts of themselves.\"\n\nIn addition, Superman, as the son of Thinker Guild genius Jor-El, is himself a prolific and eclectic genius, having been a nerdy and bookish wunderkind as a teenager, and becoming a brilliant Daily Planet reporter as an adult (often labelled a \"nerd\" by Perry White), almost rivaling the far more experienced Lois Lane herself, with Superman able to instinctively tell that General Zod couldn't be trusted, and even able to deduce Batman's secret identity. Despite being a prominent eclectic genius, however, Superman was still in many ways considerably intellectually surpassed by supergenius Lex Luthor, who successfully manipulated Superman as a pawn in his grand scheme, successfully killing him in the end with Doomsday.\n\nGrowing up as the only person of his kind, thus being very different and alienated by his peers, Clark grew up a very confused, lonely, and lost person. Hence, this, as well as his inability to understand his superhuman powers, made Clark subconsciously suppress them, with him unable to reach his full potential for many years (until he finally met Jor-El). Instilled by his parents, he grew up to selflessly care for other people and to do the right thing. Realizing that he could help others with his powers, Clark went against his father's (Jonathan) wishes to help others. Clark would even go out of his way to save Peter Ross, a boy that had relentlessly bullied him not long ago. This selflessness and faith in others shows that even before meeting Jor-El, Clark already strived to uphold what the House of El had always stood for.\n\nWith the passing of his adopted father Jonathan Kent, Clark went on a long journey of discovery, in which he eventually discovered his true name, and true purpose on Earth, going out of his way to always selflessly save people in need along the way, if it that meant exposing his alien superpowers and losing an acquired job, such as when Clark promptly abandoned his job on the \"Debbie Sue\" in order to rescue workers trapped in a collapsing oil rig. While he initially tended to be quite serious and sometimes even brooding, when Clark meets Lois Lane and receives empathy from her upon revealing himself as an alien (while also revealing his lingering guilt about heeding Jonathan Kent's request not to save him from death), Clark begins to enjoy life a bit more, with her spunky and sometimes flirty personality having a gradual effect on Clark. Lois, in turn, was so smitten with his selfless heroics, that she decided to drop what could have been the biggest story in human history for him.\n\nDue to still not understanding his alien powers and heritage, however, Clark subconsciously suppressed his superpowers, and while still incredibly powerful, this mental block considerably limited Clark relative to his full potential, and prohibited him from mastering the power of flight. However, once Clark finally meet the AI projection of his birth father Jor-El and learned of his Kryptonian heritage and true name (Kal-El), Clark finally permanently overcame this weakness and gained his full potential, becoming not only much more powerful than ever before, but also finally unlocking his power of flight, in addition to becoming more optimistic and confident as Kal-El. He now resolves to uphold what the House of El's stands for: hope, embodied in which is the potential that every individual has to be a force for good and righteousness.\n\nAs he matured, Clark learned early on how to stay calm and collected in tough situations, to control his pent up anger, instead of releasing his incredible alien power on mere humans, he instead found different means, like secretly crushing a metal pipe when aggressively dared by Ken Braverman to fight, and wrecking the truck of Ludlow when the latter insulted Clark and indecently groped Clark's female co-worker. As a result, Superman grew accustomed to holding back his incredible strength and powers quite a bit unless absolutely necessary, which is evident when Superman expressed his intention of taking in Lex Luthor \"without breaking\" him, and when Superman greatly held back while fighting the far weaker Batman. More notable instances of Clark holding himself together in angering situations are when he calmly confronts the obnoxious Ludlow (even when the latter insults and pours been over Clark's face), when he doesn't react to Byrne's insulting reprimanding (as the latter had just attempted to save his life), when he expertly interviews Bruce Wayne and answers the latter's accusations regarding Superman with calm objective statements (ignoring Bruce's condescending manner of addressing the younger reporter), when he calmly debates with his frustrated boss Perry White about the necessity of exposing Batman through the press (despite Perry being somewhat condescending), and when he does not get insulted when people (such as Perry and Kahina Ziri's neighbor) mistake him for a meek pushover (when he's disguised as a human) and advise him to be careful. Despite this, however, Superman is capable of terrifying displays of rage when provoked, shown when General Zod and Lex Luthor threatened his adopted mother Martha, with Superman promptly releasing his incredible rage upon and temporarily beating Zod into submission, and Superman seemingly threatening to destroy Lex with his heat vision, until told that his mother would die if he were to kill Lex.\n\nDue to his indomitable will, great power, selfless morality, and natural birth, Jonathan Kent believed that his adopted son would one day \"stand proudly in front of the human race\" and ultimately \"change the world\", while Jor-El believed in his son's ability to represent \"the best\" of both Earth and Krypton, and to one day give the people of Earth \"an ideal to strive towards\", helping humanity \"accomplish wonders\", especially since Kal-El Krypton's Growth Codex within his cells. Both of Kal's fathers are ultimately proven right, since despite having felt isolated from humanity for most of his life due to his alien superpowers, when Kal-El heard General Zod's menacing message to Earth, he immediately chose to protect humanity by finally revealing himself to them, even allowing himself to be handcuffed before he is brought before Zod. Upon hearing of General Zod's plans to restore Krypton on Earth, however, Kal-El is horrified and chooses to protect humanity over Krypton, absolutely refusing General Zod's offer to help the Sword of Rao sacrifice Kal-El's adopted people for the sake of a planet that had already been destroyed decades ago. Kal-El thus agreed with his father Jor-El that \"Krypton had had its chance\", and that its time had long since passed, so Kal-El did not hesitate long before destroying Zod's Genesis Chamber.\n\nDue to Kal-El being the first (and last) Kryptonian of natural birth in centuries, he is somewhat looked down upon by his fellow Kryptonians of the Sword of Rao (who were all genetically engineered in Genesis Chambers and assigned to their respective Guilds), as the orthodox General Zod views Kal-El's method of coming into existence as a \"heresy\", and Faora is quick to mock Kal-El for his sense of morality, since she believes that trait makes him weak and unconfident, giving the genetically engineered Faora (who was specifically bred to be incapable of empathy) an \"evolutionary advantage\" over him. Ultimately, however, Kal-El's natural birth actually grants him several advantages over them, since, having not been genetically engineered and bred with a specific purpose, Kal-El has a far better grasp at free will (the lack of which on High Eminence Lor-Em's part also contributed to Kryptonians' near extinction), and is far less prone to tunnel vision, while his sense of morality allows Kal-El to coexist on Earth among humanity (as their hero \"Superman\") instead of, like Zod and Faora, alienating humanity away with the arrogant preconceived notion of the physically weaker human race being inferior. Finally, Kal-El's natural birth makes him far less likely than General Zod to lose the will to live - the latter being utterly devastated and genetically unable to move on with his life after his \"life's purpose\" (restoring and protecting Krypton) is taken away, while Kal-El, despite being utterly mortified after much of the world forsakes him (due to Lex Luthor's manipulations), is ultimately still willing to unconditionally carry out his life's purpose (protecting and saving Earth) regardless, as he returned to save Lois Lane from Lex, and then gave up his life to save the ungrateful and forsaking world from Doomsday.\n\nIt was ultimately Kal-El's indomitable willpower, loyalty and refusal to give up even under seemingly insurmountable odds (most notably when he faced the combined might of Faora-Ul and Nam-Ek, both much more skilled combatants, without hesitation, persisting against them until he finally gained the upper hand and forced them to retreat) that allows Nathan Hardy to trust the alien superhero, and respect him as an ally. In admiration of his tremendous superpowers, perseverance, willpower, and heroism, the US Armed Forces nickname Kal-El \"Superman.\" Upon learning of Jor-El's plan to defeat General Zod's invasion, Superman promptly flies off to destroy the World Engine, despite knowing that being in proximity to it might potentially kill him, and successfully does so. He returns to Metropolis just in time to save Lois Lane, stubbornly flying against the tremendous force of the Phantom Zone singularity to do so.\n\nWhen General Zod is revealed to have survived and voices his plans to wipe out the entire human race in retribution against Superman, the two mighty aliens engage in a duel of epic proportions, with Superman's tremendous fortitude and perseverance allowing him to ultimately defeat the more experienced and skilled Zod. However, when General Zod expresses his refusal to stop and threatens to burn alive a cornered family, Superman is forced to kill him, making an incredibly hard choice that greatly conflicts with his morality. Hence, despite his victory, Superman screams out agony and tears at what he had to do, fully remorseful of the murder. After the invasion, however, Superman resolves to continue operating openly as Earth's superhero protector, and he trusts General Swanwick to persuade Washington DC of the selflessness of his intentions.\n\nIn order to successfully maintain his double identity as a human reporter of the Daily Planet (during the time that he isn't protecting and saving others as Superman), Clark tries to be as small and invisible as possible, in order to attract little attention to himself and to avoid inducing anyone into thinking that he could possibly be the mighty godlike Superman. As a result, Perry White appears to think of Clark as somewhat of a meek pushover, shown when he goes out of his way to advise Clark to watch himself in Gotham City, due to the city's high crime rate.\n\nShortly after Superman's debut to the world, a huge statue of him is built in Heroes Park, Metropolis, and online message boards are created, which numerous people from all over the world use as a means to ask Superman for help. However, during the next two years, despite the world's majority having a positive response to Superman, due to the extraordinary heroics he demonstrated when defeating General Zod, there are many who are more than slow to accept the supremely powerful godlike alien with unrestrained power, since as Jonathan Kent had warned Clark, that \"Superman\" would change the whole world, ranging from beliefs to \"notions of what it means to be human\", and Jor-El had warned him that while the people of Earth would eventually \"join [him] in the sun\", they would initially \"stumble\" and \"fall\" while \"racing behind him\". Hence, while Vikram Gandhi and Senator Finch express openly positive views (that Superman, as a representation of the Messianic savior figure found in all religions, is \"just a guy trying to do the right thing\", and that only actions carried out unilaterally by Superman are problematic), astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is worried about the paradigm shift that Superman's very existence, as an alien on Earth, has in challenging humanity's sense of priority in the Universe (much like how Copernican Heliocentrism and Darwinian Evolution had done before), while Glen Woodburn and Andrew Sullivan are extremely skeptical, bringing up humanity's horrible track record of following people with great power in the past (down paths that led to huge human monstrosities), as well as questioning the moral constraints on Superman, since International Law renders every one of Superman's acts as a political one. Even more skeptical, however, are Batman and Lex Luthor, however, as the former fears the possibility of Superman becoming malevolently corrupted (having seen many seemingly benevolent individuals become corrupted during his long career), while the latter, due to his intense misotheism and deluded godlike self-image, sees Superman's very existence as a \"sin.\" Hence, both of them, for their own respective reasons, resolve to kill Superman.\n\nDespite Superman making a point to stay out of potentially controversial political disputes (such as wars between the nations of Earth), he is eventually forced get involved in the Nairomian Civil War in order to rescue Lois Lane, and in the process, is superbly framed by Lex Luthor and Kahina Ziri for the murder of many Nairomians. Despite the horrific incident, Clark and Lois are determined to make their burgeoning romance work, with Clark being romantic, flirty, and affectionate towards her, enough that Clark could get into a tub with Lois, while he himself was fully clothed. However, Clark refuses to ignore the incident, so shortly thereafter, he initially attempts to talk to Kahina Ziri and help resolve her issues with him following Nairomi, and when that proves unsuccessful, he resolves to cooperate with Senator Finch as Superman, and attend a Capitol hearing on the Nairomian incident.\n\nDue to his own unwavering selfless morality, Superman is initially disgusted by Batman and the latter's morally gray methods of dealing with crime in Gotham City (which Superman distastefully called a \"one-man reign of terror\"), as the latter had a penchant for ruthlessly torturing, branding, and even killing certain criminals, with those branded by him being murdered in jail by other inmates (notably Cesar Santos, though those murders are later revealed to be secretly orchestrated by Lex Luthor, who intended to pit the two superheroes against one another), and the general public fearing Batman. As such, while Clark initially intends to expose Batman through the press, he soon doubts the effectiveness of this method after learning that the GCPD is actually helping Batman, quarreling with Perry White, who considers Clark's views on morality somewhat outdated (claiming that \"American conscious died with Robert, Martin and John\"), and hearing from Adriana Santos (whose son was now orphaned following Cesar's murder) that words from Clark's pen cannot stop Batman, as the only method to actually do so is \"a fist\", implying that only severe punishment is an effective deterrent against Batman. Hence, an infuriated Clark decides to take a more direct approach to dealing with Batman, this time as Superman. His anger and frustration with Batman render Superman somewhat darker than usual - he abruptly confronts the Dark Knight, ordering Batman to give up his crusade, to ignore the Bat-Signal the next time it lights up, and to consider this warning from him mercy, with Superman tearing off the Batmobile's doors for good measure. As he turned to depart, Batman counters with a threat of his own, expressing his determination to make Superman \"bleed\". Not impressed with Batman's threat, Superman flies off.\n\nWhile there are notably quite a few anti-Superman protesters gathered before the Capitol on the day of the Nairomi hearing (with banners labelled \"SuperDeath\", \"Thanks for the \"Help\"!\", \"Earth Belongs to Humans\", \"God Hates Aliens\" and \"Aliens Doom Nations\", a House of El glyph with a Nazi swastika, as well as an alien-shaped head on a pole), Lois stands there as well, for additional support. However, after Lex Luthor orchestrates a devastating bombing during that hearing (via hidden explosives in Wallace Keefe's wheelchair), Superman is speculated by the media to have been somehow involved, so a mob of protesters assembles outside the Capitol building's wreckage, burning a large ragdoll of Superman, while chanting in outrage.\n\nSuperman is utterly mortified by the incident, with him claiming that he hadn't been able to prevent the bombing only because he hadn't been looking for a potential bomb with his X-ray vision in the first place (not knowing that Lex Luthor had lined the wheelchair's interior with lead). Devastated at how his actions had so far consistently lead to horrible consequences, Superman claims that the whole idea of \"Superman\" had never even been real in the first place, with it only ever being \"the dream of a farmer from Kansas,\" with him coming to doubt that he could ever represent \"the best of both worlds\" and be \"an ideal to strive towards\" if humanity is so self-destructive in nature, no matter what he does. When Lois insists that that this \"dream\" is all that most people have to give them hope, pointing out that his House of El glyph still means something. However, Superman sadly replies that while it did on Krypton, that world no longer exists, and he then promptly flies off, into self-imposed exile.\n\nWhile in exile, however, Superman recalls how Jonathan Kent had once told him how the latter, at the age of 12, had believed himself to be a hero after saving his farm from a flood, yet inadvertently thereby flooding the Langs' farm. Jonathan reminds Clark that every action has consequences and that it is imperative to accept them whether they are beneficial or catastrophic. Jonathan also mentions how meeting Martha Kent allowed him to recover from the guilt of flooding the Lang farm and kept him grounded. Encouraged, Clark promptly returns to Metropolis but not before he says to his father that he misses him dearly.\n\nLex, however, promptly forces a malevolent ultimatum upon a returned Superman - to fly to Gotham City and kill Batman in a vicious duel to the death, and subsequently bring the vigilante's head to Lex, all in order to save the life of his kidnapped mother Martha Kent. Superman is shaken up by the power Lex's ultimatum holds over him, since despite his disapproval of Batman's morally gray methods, Superman recognizes him as a good (albeit mislead and unnecessarily brutal) man, so this conflicts with his morality even more than the murder of General Zod. Hence, Superman, sadly remarking that \"no one stays good in this world\", instead resolves to reason with and persuade Batman to help him escape this ultimatum and rescue his mother from Luthor. Hence, despite Superman's ability to effortlessly kill Batman, he holds back while fighting the latter, determined to get through to him, though Batman's sudden implementation of Kryptonite gas grenades make that extremely difficult. In the end, however, when weakened and pinned down by Batman who intends to kill him, Superman desperately implores him to help him save his mother Martha, which allowed Batman to finally realize that Superman is in fact a truly selfless person. The fact that both of their mothers share the same name (\"Martha\") enables Batman to see Superman as being fundamentally just as human as himself, despite his alien heritage and superpowers, so Batman renounces his former brutal murderous methods with disgust (seeing just how far gone he had become due to them), hurls aside his Kryptonite spear, and agrees to team up with Superman against Luthor.\n\nTrusting his new ally to save his mother, Superman flies back to confront and bring in Lex Luthor, but the latter unexpectedly unleashes the bloodthirsty monster Doomsday upon him. Despite the malevolent manipulations and horrific ultimatum than Lex had just put him through, Superman once again showcases his exceptional benevolence by blocking a punch from Doomsday (who was too bloodthirsty too distinguish between friend or foe) aimed at Lex, saving the latter's life. Superman then once more demonstrates his indomitable will by persisting against his seemingly unstoppable opponent, endangering himself in order to ensure that a nuke hit Doomsday. When that proves ineffective, Superman defiantly teams up with Batman and Wonder Woman against the unstoppable monster and continues fighting. Eventually, Superman sees that the only way to stop Doomsday will end up putting his life at risk (since brute force alone had been proven ineffective), so, despite much of the world having forsaken him, Superman is still willing to sacrifice himself in order to save it, so he takes hold of the Kryptonite spear and charges, with Superman's tremendous willpower and determination being enough to temporarily bypass the Kryptonite's weakening and superpower negation effects just long enough for him to pierce the monster. Despite the dying Doomsday managing to mortally wound Superman, the latter ignores the incredible pain of his impending death and persists defiantly up until his own dying breath (to further plunge his weapon into Doomsday), much to Batman and Wonder Woman's admiration, respect, and astonishment. Indeed, Wonder Woman was astounded to have finally, after 100 years, meet a person who had both the phenomenal godly might of Ares, and the self-sacrificing morality of Steve Trevor, and she was therefore equally saddened at Superman's death.\n\nHence, despite much of the world having forsaken Superman at the time of his death (\"stumble\" and \"fall\" while \"racing behind him\", as Jor-El had put it), all of those who doubted and harshly criticized him (except for Lex Luthor who was exuberant and gleeful at his archnemesis' death) would come to mourn his passing in guilt-ridden fashion, finally coming to posthumously see, admire, and look up to Superman as Earth's greatest superhero (a \"national hero\", as Admiral Olsen claimed), and an \"ideal to strive towards\", with the words \"If you seek his monument, look around you\" being written upon his tomb, emphasizing how Superman's heroic sacrifice had guaranteed that the entire world and humanity are still around, saved from Doomsday's unstoppable bloodthirsty rampage of apocalyptic proportions. In addition, Superman's heroic death would inspire Batman and Wonder Woman to establish the Justice League, posthumously honoring him, with Batman determined not to fail Superman in death. Also, Superman's noble sacrifice seems to have finally given Batman a more optimistic and hopeful outlook, since he says to Wonder Woman that despite their many flaws, \"men are still good\", and that they do in fact have the potential in them to rebuild and improve (a crucial House of El-based belief held by Superman himself in life). Even the extremely amoral and manipulative Amanda Waller posthumously respects Superman (fondly saying how he had shared humanity's ideals), while also noting that quite a few metahumans were also inspired by Superman's selfless sacrifice, which induced them to finally come out into the open and reveal themselves to the world as well, with a notable one of them being the speedster superhero Flash. Even villainous metahumans, like Enchantress, and Incubus would be similarly inspired.\n\nAnother consistent trait in Superman, as Batman put it, was to make others \"see the best parts of themselves.\" This is what allowed Superman to inspire Pete Ross (who had previously bullied him) to become a good man, to inspire Lois Lane to do the right thing (despite her previously just wanting to publish the alien's story), to gain the trust and respect of General Swanwick and Colonel Hardy (despite them initially being gruff, fearful, xenophobic, and not even seeing him as human), to inspire Dr. Hamilton to risk his life to defeat the Kryptonian invasion (despite him usually being shy and soft-spoken), to inspire Perry White to risk his life saving his DP employees (despite him usually being gruff and controlling), to inspire Steve Lombard to risk his life saving Jenny Jurwich (despite him usually being sleazy and unfriendly), to gain the respect of the US Armed Forces and inspire them to give his superhero nickname (despite them initially being hostile, fearful, and xenophobic towards him), to inspire the brutal fallen Batman to snap out of his rage and once again become a selfless superhero (despite him having initially wanted to kill the alien), and also to inspire the cynical and almost hopeless Wonder Woman to finally become a full-time superhero again (despite her having stepped away 100 years ago). Indeed, the only time Superman ever failed to inspire a flawed individual to \"see the best parts of himself\" and do a heroic deed was when he saved Lex Luthor from Doomsday, since despite this disproving Lex's main reason for hating God and Superman, Lex was already too far gone and too malevolent an individual to change his ways.\n\nDespite Superman's inspirational selfless benevolence, however, Batman's original fears were not entirely unfounded, as Superman is ultimately not completely incorruptible, since, as seen in the vision of a possible future (shown to Batman by that future's Flash), when either Martha Kent or Lois Lane were brutally murdered, Superman's devastation and incredible grief would unhinge him, inducing him to become dark and malevolent, going so far as to take over the Earth (with a newly founded army of Regime Stormtroopers) as its tyrant totalitarian ruler, forming an alliance with Darkseid's Parademons in the process. This version of Superman wore a permanent sinister scowl, and was able to kill Insurgency enemies to his Regime without any reluctance and in the most ruthless and brutal of ways, allowing him to burn his Insurgency prisoners into ash with heat vision, and to murder that future's Batman by ripping out the latter's heart. Indeed, this evil version of Superman was so dark, hardcore, and fearsome, that even Batman himself showed visible signs of fear when Superman confronted the imprisoned vigilante, holding the latter at his mercy. Thankfully though, the present day's Batman seems to have successfully altered that timeline, as he heeded the advice of that future's Flash - to find and assemble the Justice League.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Superman"}}

She, along with the other Daily Planet staff, watched General Zod's warning.\n\nLater, when General Zod's starship entered Metropolis, it shot a colossal gravity beam into the city, which began to level everything around it. Her boss Perry White ordered an evacuation and Jenny ran out alongside him and Steve Lombard. Jenny ran from a falling skyscraper, but became trapped under the debris it left. Perry and Steve tried to get her out as the gravity beam encroached. Perry held her hand and they looked at one another in their twilight, only for the beam to suddenly stop (as Superman had managed to destroy the World Engine just in time).\n\nAfter the defeat of General Zod and his forces, the rebuilding effort began in Metropolis. Jenny went back to work for the Daily Planet, where she was offered a date with Steve Lombard which she rejects, immediately prior to all of them being introduced to Clark Kent, with Jenny never suspecting the newcomer actually being Superman in disguise.\n\nDuring the 18 months after the Black Zero Event, Jenny has worked her way from an intern to a full-fledged reporter and assistant to Perry White himself.\n\nJenny, Perry, Lois, and Clark all watched in dismay the news coverage of Wallace Keefe's arrest, for the desecration of Superman's statue in Heroes Park. Perry then promptly proposes a news headline to her: \"End of Love Affair with Man in the Sky?\"\n\nJenny attends the Daily Planet staff meeting that takes place shortly after Clark's return from Gotham City. Affected by what he had seen and heard, Clark requests to be allowed to expose the ruthless Batman vigilante through the press, but this only earns him Perry's mockery, as the latter claims that \u201Cthe American conscience died with Robert, Martin, and John\u201D. At that moment, Lois enters the meeting, displaying a bullet found in Nairomi, letting Perry know that she intended to fly to Washington DC to further investigate.\n\nA few days later, Jenny is nearby when Perry angrily confronts Clark about not covering the Metropolis football match or Lex Luthor's fundraiser for the Metropolis Library, and instead relentlessly pursuing Batman. Shortly thereafter, when Perry looks for Clark (needing to tell him something), he asks Jenny if she knows where Clark is (with him actually having donned the Supersuit and flown to confront Batman directly). Jenny, however, admits to not knowing.\n\nAfter the tragic bombing of the US Capitol (orchestrated by Lex Luthor), Jenny reads the new news headline of the Daily Planet to her co-workers, questioning if Superman had actually been involved in setting the tragedy up.\n\nJenny and her co-workers at the Daily Planet watch TV news coverage of the electrical disturbance coming from the US government-controlled Fortress of Solitude crash site near Heroes Park, before the black out and before Doomsday emerged to battle Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.  \n\nWhen the power goes out, Jenny becomes distressed, and calls out to Perry, as she and the other workers in the building began to panic. When the United States government launches a nuclear missile at Superman and Doomsday (who are ferociously battling in outer space), the resulting explosion is so gigantic, that it can be clearly seen at the ground level, as Jenny, Perry, and others can be seen observing the carnage above from the window of the Daily Planet building.\n\nWhile Doomsday was slayed by Superman by the battles end, the dying monster mortally wounded him as well with his dying breath. Jenny's co-worker Clark Kent is also reported by Lois Lane to have died during the devastating battle, having chosen to carry out his duties as a reporter and cover it.\n\nWhile mourning the tragic death of Superman (who had once saved her in the Black Zero Event), Jenny doesn't attend his huge ceremonial funeral, and instead joins Perry, Lois, and some other co-workers (along with Lana Lang, Pete Ross, and Daniel Leone) in attending Clark Kent's funeral in Smallville, due to him having been her colleague.

Despite this, she could not bear standing idly by as the bloodthirsty juggernaut Doomsday wrecked havoc, thus allying with Superman and Batman to take him down. With Superman seemingly killed by the monster, Wonder Woman and Batman would be inspired by his noble sacrifice (with her being reminded of Steve Trevor's) to begin establishing the Justice League, in order to battle any future threats to the world.","Diana was born in approximately 3000 B.C. on the island of Themyscira, to Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons, mere months after the War of the Gods. As the only child on the entire island, it was harder for her to enjoy more childlike activities. To which, she soon took an active interest in Amazonian combat training, even with her mother's stern refusal of it. Despite this, Antiope, knowing the true nature of Diana's background and caring so deeply for her wellbeing, she began training the young princess herself in secret.","After hearing Steve talked about the war, Diana thought that Ares stood behind this and stopping Ares was the Amazons' duty. She asked Hippolyta to go with Steve to the war but her mother didn't allow her to do that. That night, Diana stole the Amazonian Shield, the Lasso of Truth and the Godkiller. She then escaped with Steve. Before leaving Themyscira, Hippolyta gave Diana Antiope's tiara and told her to be careful.","At some point, Diana left Themyscira with Steve Trevor for the United Kingdom, determined to help the Allied Powers win World War I. There she would befriend Trevor's secretary Etta Candy. Steve, Diana and Etta go to buy some clothes so that Diana will look less distracting. Along the way they confront German spies that try to retrieve the book that Steve took, blocking a bullet that was meant to shoot Steve she fights off the spies determined to get answers from one of the spies on where she can find Ares until the spy kills himself by swallowing a cyanide pill.","She fights off against a group of German soldiers in a warehouse meeting the rest of Steve Trevor's team fighting off more Germans that were invading saving the village. The citizens from that town see Diana as a hero. In honor of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor's team's bravery, a photograph was taking of her with Steve Trevor's team.","The next day they decide to infiltrate Ludendorff's gala to learn more about the weapon he and Dr. Poison are creating and how to stop it. To enter the gala, Diana stole a dress from a guest where she dances with Ludendorff's prepared to kill him but her attempt is intervened by Steve. She hears Ludendorff release some of the gas where it kills citizens from that town.","Receiving a signal from Chief, she infiltrates Ludendorff's base. She and General Ludendorff fight each other where Diana kills him. Thinking that killing Ludendorff would solve the problem, she gets confused when she sees the German soldiers loading the weapons onto the planes thinking that humankind is corrupted and it doesn't deserve her help.","During the fight, Steve approaches Diana who can't hear him speak due to an explosion temporarily rupturing her eardrums. Steve, after much talking, departs and leaves Diana with his watch before boarding the plane which is taking off with the mustard gas. Ares eventually restrains Diana, imploring her to surrender and realize the futility of their fight. Diana notices the plane in the sky as she's pinned to the ground and watches in horror as it explodes with Steve sacrificing himself to save billions of lives.","Returning to London where the people are celebrating the end of the war, Diana notices a memorial with pictures of deceased soldiers who fought in the war with Steve being among them. Diana lovingly strokes Steve's picture before closing her eyes to take in the world being at peace once again.","Despite helping win the war, defeating Ares and still loving humanity, Diana is still left sobered, emotionally broken, psychologically scarred, and devastated over not having been able to save the Belgian village from Dr. Poison, as well as over her beloved Steve Trevor's self-sacrificing death. Indeed, Diana would later claim that she \"would never be the same\" ever again after World War I. Moreover, in the years that followed, Diana bore witness to a \"century of horrors\" (World War II, Cold War proxy wars, Fascism, Communism, nuclear weapons' deployment, revolutions, geopolitical brinkmanship, racism, homophobia, genocides, war crimes, propaganda, and etc.), and due to all of this occurring without Ares being there to spread corruption, Diana almost completely loses faith in humanity, coming to believe that humans \"made a world where standing together is impossible.\" As such, Diana resolves to mostly abandon superheroism, and does so for 100 years.","84 years after World War I in 2002, Diana briefly came out of her heroic exile. She was forced to fight killer and thief Slipknot, whom she effortlessly defeated and left to be apprehended by the FBI. Diana got involved because she took personal issue against Slipknot's known cruelty towards women, and therefore wanted him brought to justice.","13 years after Slipknot's imprisonment, after examining the photo of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor's team taken in 1918 Belgium, Lex Luthor uses facial recognition software to deduce that the great Amazon warrior is in fact still alive, under the alias of \"Diana Prince,\" working at the Louvre Museum, and he obtains footage of Diana in Paris, France, which has her exiting a taxi and entering a shop, in civilian clothing.","During his greeting speech, Lex makes a reference to how Zeus cruelly punished the Titan Prometheus for enlightening humankind, much to the visible dismay of Diana. Shortly thereafter, she covertly steals a hacking device of Bruce Wayne's, who is likewise investigating Lex Luthor. She exits the party with Bruce pursuing her, but manages to make it to her car and drive off just in time for Bruce to see her depart.","Later, Diana is seen in the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities (with ancient Greco-Roman exhibits), conversing with an elderly couple, when the curator comes up, and offers to show her something of interest. She politely excuses herself and follows him to the exhibit of the fake replica of Alexander the Great's sword, which the ancient conqueror of the Middle East had used to cut the Gordian knot.","Still puzzled as to Diana's identity, Bruce discovers more about her amongst the data he stole from Lex Luthor. He sees a photograph of her alongside Steve Trevor's team, taken in Belgium in 1918 during the closing days of World War I. He then makes contact with her via her laptop, sharing extra information that Luthor had on both her and other metahumans, such as the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg. Diana is visibly intrigued and shocked at this revelation, as Flash's lightning reminds her of that of Ares, Aquaman reminds her of depictions of Poseidon, while the Mother Box that created Cyborg reminds her of the one she briefly saw back on Themyscira. Diana resolves to take some time to think this revelation over, does not answer Bruce's e-mail, and instead proceeds with her plans to depart Metropolis on a flight back to France, through Turkey.","When news broke of Doomsday's attack on Metropolis, Diana was boarding an airplane bound for Turkey. Seeing what was happening, she left the flight before takeoff. Diana once again dons her Wonder Woman armor and weapons, heading for Gotham City to help Batman and Superman in their battle against this incredibly powerful monstrous opponent.  As Wonder Woman joins the Battle against Doomsday, she arrives just in time to save Batman from Doomsday's lethal thermal blast, deflecting the beams with her indestructible bracelets. She then jointly attacks Doomsday with Superman while Batman tries to expose the creature to Kryptonite, allowing its destruction. She relentlessly battles the monster, and despite Doomsday being stronger, Wonder Woman held her own, parrying a tremendous punch with the Sword of Athena, and then slicing off Doomsday's right arm with it. Eventually, Batman baits the monster into coming closer to her, allowing Wonder Woman to hurl the noose of her unbreakable Lasso of Truth around his torso. Superman then promptly flew back, wielding the Kryptonite spear, and managed to impale the monster's chest. The mortally wounded Doomsday bellowed in agony, releasing immense amounts of electricity from his body, which made Wonder Woman momentary loose her footing, loosening the lasso's hold and allowing the monster to mortally stab Superman.","Diana attends Clark's funeral in Smallville along with Bruce, with the latter paying for it as an anonymous donor. The two share a conversation about honoring Superman by bringing together the three other metahumans (Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg), in case a worse threat to the world should ever arise. Diana inquires why Bruce is proposing it. He replies that it is simply due to a feeling he has that things will imminently get worse (in reality, he was following the instructions given to him by the scarlet time-traveler that appeared in one of his \"dreams\", as well as heeding Lex Luthor's enigmatic warning). While Diana still expresses doubt about humankind, Bruce assures her that it is still good and capable of improvement. Diana walk away from the graveyard, pondering his words.","Considering Bruce's offer, Diana meanwhile returns to her job as Curator for the Department of Antiquities at the Louvre Museum. Bruce eventually sends Diana a package, which contains the physical photograph of herself with Steve Trevor's team. This causes her to reminisce over her childhood, naive idealism, and all of the ensuing events of World War I. Recalling Steve Trevor's belief in her, his self-sacrificing death, as well as how Superman's equally selfless death had reminded her that it is possible for individuals to have both the phenomenal godly might of Ares, and the self-sacrificing morality of Steve Trevor, Diana finally begins to regain hope in what Bruce had told her during their last meeting, and sends him a thankful e-mail. Diana then promptly dons her Wonder Woman armor, ready to officially return to superheroism after hearing a disturbance in the distance of Paris by sailing off the roof of the Louvre Museum at sunset in Paris to confront it.","More to be added later","More to be added later","After Bruce returned from his intended recruitment of Arthur Curry, Diana inquired if it was successful, with Bruce merely replying \"more or less.\" When she presses him further, asking if that meant \"more 'more', or more 'less'?\" a somewhat saddened Bruce admitted to Arthur having declined."],"name":"Wonder Woman","description":"Diana is a very kind, loving, compassionate, and benevolent person, who, while initially somewhat naive, is an outspoken egalitarian, evidenced by her asking her mother Hippolyta with incredulous outrage why she and the other Amazons have chosen to abandon humankind, despite being initially created by Zeus to spread love and mutual understanding among humanity, as well as protect it from Ares. Growing up, Diana also proves herself headstrong and determined, enthusiastically wishing to learn armed and hand-to-hand combat under her aunt Antiope's tutelage, despite her mother initially forbidding it. Diana becomes more determined than ever to leave Themyscira and help save \"Man's World\" after her aunt Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana's life and tells Diana with her final breath that the time has finally come. Indeed, Diana became so determined to leave Themyscira after that, that even Hippolyta (albeit begrudgingly) finally agreed to let her leave. Diana is also a very naive idealist when first arriving in \"Man's World\", for instance believing the story that she had been sculpted from clay, and that the World War I Central Powers would simply abandon their sinister ways if she kills Ares. In addition, Diana also voiced her opinions rather bluntly and rashly back then, perceiving Etta Candy's job as Steve Trevor's secretary to be akin to slavery (which earns Diana Etta's admiration).\n\nDue to still not understanding her powers (which came from Diana believing her mother Hippolyta's lie about Diana having been sculpted from clay and brought to life by Zeus), however, Diana subconsciously suppressed them, and while still incredibly powerful, this mental block considerably limited Diana relative to her full potential (to the point that enhanced metahuman General Ludendorff was able to initially keep up with her in a fight), and prohibited her from mastering the powers of amokinesis and divine electrokinesis. However, once Diana finally learned of her Olympian God heritage from Ares and embraced who she is as the demigoddess Godkiller daughter of Zeus, Diana finally permanently overcame this weakness and gained her full potential, becoming not only much more powerful than ever before, but also finally unlocking her powers of amokinesis and divine electrokinesis (which allowed her to overpower Ares), in addition to becoming more optimistic and confident as the Godkiller.\n\nDiana begins to lose faith in both humanity and herself when killing General Ludendorff (whom she assumed to be Ares) didn't end the war, and when finally confronted by the actual Ares, her eyes are truly opened to humanity's inherent potential for evil, and while she clings on to her love and compassion for humanity in order to defeat the God of War, Diana is still left sobered, emotionally broken, psychologically scarred, and devastated over not having been able to save the Belgian village from Dr. Poison, as well as over her beloved Steve Trevor's self-sacrificing death, and not believing that other humans are capable of the same level of selflessness, after witnessing the ensuing \"century of horrors\" (World War II, Cold War proxy wars, Fascism, Communism, nuclear weapons' deployment, revolutions, geopolitical brinkmanship, racism, homophobia, genocides, war crimes, propaganda, and etc.). Indeed, Diana would later claim that after her experiences in \"Man's World\", she \"would never be the same\" ever again. As such, Diana resolves to mostly abandon superheroism, and does so for 100 years following World War I. However, she was ultimately unable to bear standing idly by while the seemingly unstoppable juggernaut Doomsday wrecked havoc, and ultimately joined the battle with the monster, saving Batman in the process. After witnessing the self-sacrificing death of Superman in that battle, Diana is astounded to have finally, after 100 years, met a person who had both the phenomenal godly might of Ares, and the self-sacrificing morality of Steve Trevor, and therefore while very saddened by Superman's death, it induced her to slowly begin regaining hope in humanity and superheroism, recalling Steve Trevor's immense belief in her.\n\nDue to her benevolent and loving nature, Diana is also exceptionally considerate, diplomatic, and empathetic, with her diplomatically accepting a false antiquities claim (about a replica of Alexander the Great's sword) and a glass of wine from the curator of the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities, giving Lois Lane a sad glance of silent empathy after the latter's beloved Superman had seemingly been killed (recalling her own pain during Steve Trevor's death), and notably treating both Charlie and the Flash with compassion, despite the former's initial skepticism about her and poor self-esteem, and the latter's tendency to somewhat annoy her and the other Justice Leaguers with his humorous attitude. Indeed, Wonder Woman's compassion and unbreakable spirit gave a renewed hope to Steve Trevor's team, energizing them past the point of purely monetary interests, with Chief resolving to no longer be neutral in the war and believing her story of the Olympian Gods, Sameer finally admitting his passion for acting, and even the depressed Charlie struggling with PTSD finally beginning to sing again for the first time in years. Likewise, during the Justice League's battle against Steppenwolf's forces, Wonder Woman was able to inspire confidence into the inexperienced Flash and Cyborg, assuring them that they wouldn't need to fight the Apokoliptan invasion alone. When humanity's inherent potential for evil is revealed to her by Ares, Wonder Woman, while initially taken aback, ultimately rejects the prospect of alliance with Ares against them, even if that were to mean missing out on \"paradise\" on Earth, and instead courageously confronts him, as the Godkiller.\n\nWhen someone she cares about is hurt, Wonder Woman becomes far more relentless and ruthless in battle. When seemingly beaten by Ares (who was only growing more powerful from her violence, rage, and hatred) and having to watch her beloved Steve Trevor die, this made her go into an agonizing rage, as she assaulted and brutalized several armed German soldiers with immense speed and ferocity. She even came close to murdering Dr. Poison as vengeance for Steve's death, all under Ares's influence. But recalling Steve's great love for and undying belief in her, made Diana realize that she too loved him and was thereby able to muster up enough willpower, restraint, compassion and love to overcome her violent emotions and tendencies, thus was able to swiftly overpower an angered Ares.\n\nAfter living in \"Man's World\" for a century following World War I, Diana gradually became far wiser, more experienced, and very sophisticated, no longer having issues blending in with human high class society, with her tremendously long immortal life allowing Diana to accumulate an immense amount of knowledge on antiques (though seemingly specializing in ancient Greco-Roman ones, as daughter of Zeus), to the point that she works as Curator for the Department of Antiquities at the extremely prestigious Louvre Museum and is held in very high esteem by the curator of the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities. This, in addition to her exceptional perceptiveness, makes Diana the wisest and most emotionally intelligent member of the Justice League.\n\nIn addition, Diana greatly respects other noble selfless warriors, as she attended Superman's funeral in Smallville and spoke of how he had been much more than a soldier (adding to what Batman said about Metropolis burying an empty casket), despite never getting to know Superman personally, since she saw much of Steve Trevor in him. As a result of her great posthumous respect, she was therefore more than willing to aid Batman in honoring the heroic death of Superman, by helping round up the metahumans from Lex Luthor's files into a team of superheroes (later known as the Justice League) to protect the world from the imminent mysterious alien invader Darkseid and his Parademon minions, after Superman's death left the world vulnerable.\n\nWhile benevolent, Diana is also a fierce warrior, and ruthless when facing her mortal enemies in battle as Wonder Woman. Her love of the challenge of battle caused Diana to smile and briefly laugh when she was beaten to the ground by Doomsday, as she was intrigued by his phenomenal strength, having not come across an opponent of such power since Ares, causing her to briefly smile at the challenge to defeat him. Diana was also annoyed by Doomsday, however, after first being attacked by him, causing her to eagerly hit the monster back, harder than before. Diana did, however, take the fight seriously, and performed to the best of her ability to stop the threat the monstrous juggernaut posed, notably restraining Doomsday while Batman weakened him with a Kryptonite gas grenade, and Superman delivered the killing blow.\n\nIn addition, Diana appears to hold her father Zeus in very high esteem, as she was visibly angered when Lex Luthor referred to him distastefully while discussing the story of the Titan Prometheus.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wonder_Woman"}}

Initially under Amanda Waller's control, Enchantress was viewed as one of the candidates for Suicide Squad membership, but the malevolent witch swiftly escaped, freeing her brother Incubus and attempting to take over Earth with their combined mystical powers. In the end, however, Enchantress and her brother are killed by the combined efforts of the Squad and military","Enchantres was born in 4357 BCE, more than a millennia prior to the War of the Gods. Due to their incredible power, Enchantress and her brother Incubus were worshiped as gods by ancient humans of Pre-Columbian South America, but were ultimately betrayed by her subjects and somehow defeated and sealed away into containers, which, in turn, were placed inside a tomb of Tres Osos Caves for millennia.","When Waller approaches the government for approval to form the Suicide Squad, June accompanies her for the purpose of turning herself into the Enchantress in front of the committee to convince the members of the use of harnessing criminals and metahumans for military purposes. She uses her teleportation abilities to warp to Iran and obtain a highly sought-after file containing the Iranian nuclear arsenal inventory as a gift to impress the otherwise terrified staff. Waller is then given their authorization.","Soon after, June transforms into the Enchantress during her sleep while in Midway City. She teleports away to Waller's room and opens another vial, which contains the spirit of her brother Incubus. She goes to Midway City and incapacitates a man, Gerard Davis, in the subway for Incubus to use as a host once she releases him. She tells him to wait and build up his powers. When the time came, Incubus attacked the Midway City subway, absorbing many people to restore his true form and destroying trains. The efforts of the US military and local police to \"contain\" him failed dramatically, with the first responders were wiped out by Incubus' tentacles. Waller then sends June Moone and Rick Flag to destroy Incubus, but the attempt turns into an opportunity for Enchantress to escape and join her brother instead. Although without her heart, and thus unable to bring the full extent of her powers to bear, Enchantress is saved from an apparent death under Waller's hands and is restored to her more \"healthy\" form by her brother sharing his power with her. She is then more than capable enough to begin creating her army and an extremely powerful mystical superweapon. While Incubus continues to wreak havoc in the city and destroy the military's attacks against them, he also contributes to the superweapon by lifting the wreckage of buildings and destroyed military equipment to the \"ring\" now hovering above Midway City. The military is soon forced to evacuate and call up the rest of the Suicide Squad against this new threat.  Her monstrous Eyes of the Adversary minions (created by converting humans in Midway City) minions capture Amanda Waller, whom Enchantress attaches to her superweapon, in order to destroy the armies and weapons of the modern world. Without resistance, she would be able to takeover the world again."],"name":"Enchantress","description":"Just like her brother Incubus, Enchantress is a being of pure malevolence (to the point that even the somewhat amoral Deadshot calls her out on it in outrage), who takes pride in once having been worshiped by ancient humans as a goddess, and she is thus very eager to conquer the modern world with her mystical powers, once she possesses June Moone, frees herself from Amanda Waller, and frees her brother.\n\nEnchantress does, however, seem to dearly love her brother, helping him adjust to the 'new world' and after Incubus' death at the hands of the Suicide Squad, she is devastated and, upon her posterior defeat, expresses a desire to be reunited with him in death.\n\nShe was also shown to have a very mischievous side to her such as the time when she deliberately pressed the button to live explosives only seconds after Rick Flag had instructed her how to detonate them before teleporting away while laughing. As well as deliberately jump scaring Gerard Davis for seemingly no reason other then her own amusement by appearing in a bathroom mirror before grabbing his head through the mirror and smashing it into the glass, all before transferring her brother's mind and soul into his body. All of this indicates that the Enchantress has a very twisted sense of humor. Somewhat ironically this makes her very similar to Harley Quinn, the one who ultimately caused her defeat.\n\nEnchantress was also known to have extreme pride in her status as a metahuman, even thinking of herself as a goddess. As one of the oldest living metahumans, she takes great pleasure in showing off her powers, and firmly believes that it is the metahumans' destiny to inherent the Earth from their human oppressors, believing that the events of recent years are sign that they are ready to rise up against the humans. Despite this, Enchantress was willing to allow certain humans, provided that they were useful or amusing, such as Deadshot or Harley Quinn to live, provided they agreed to serve her in the new world.\n\nShe is also manipulative, trying to bring others under her control, notably creating a large army of humans whom she converted into Eyes of the Adversary. She managed to use Flag's love for her host, June Moone, to keep him quiet about her vanishing (to free Incubus) by showing him a vision of June dying.\n\nHowever (ironically, much like Amanda Waller), Enchantress' incredible level of power also makes her arrogant, inducing her to think of herself as a goddess, who is entitled to be worshiped by human and metahumans alike. Hence, she is relatively easily outsmarted by the cunning, yet far less powerful Harley Quinn, which allows Enchantress to be defeated.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Enchantress"}}

She is a manipulative and devious leverager, priding herself in being able to frequently get people to act against their own self-interests, even people as dangerous the members of her Suicide Squad, with Waller gaining leverage over them, rather than simply attempting to out-fight them, using any of their exploitable weaknesses to her advantage. Indeed, her nickname is \"The Wall\" due to how ruthless, dominating, and unrelenting she is when dealing with others, which makes Waller one of the most feared and respected people in the US government. Indeed, prior to joining ARGUS, Rick Flag would be warned about Waller via frightening stories about her (which many people have a tendency to initially disbelieve), and Harley Quinn even compared Waller to the biblical Devil. However, in this regard, Waller unintentionally gains the respect (and to some extent, disrespect) of the Squad after ruthlessly executing her FBI subordinates in front of them. After witnessing this, Deadshot, himself a notorious assassin, respectfully calls Waller a \"mean lady\", remarking that \"[it's] gangsta\", while Killer Croc even claims to like her. Waller also knows to make some useful situational allies, a notable one being Batman.\n\nAlthough Waller has no metahuman powers herself, she more than makes up for it with her tremendous determination and willpower, which make her an extremely formidable opponent. Hence, when Enchantress kidnaps her and demands that Waller reveal the locations of the secret technological facilities of ARGUS, Waller adamantly refuses, emphasizing that she wouldn't break under torture, challenging Enchantress to \"do [her] worst\", even fearlessly insulting the latter to her face. Enchantress is thereby forced to knock out and telepathically assault the mind of Waller to get her way.\n\nHowever, Waller's leverage-based power is also her greatest weakness, since (ironically, much like Enchantress) it occasionally makes her arrogant and overconfident, believing that her perfect leverage over everyone she wishes to control, makes her supremely powerful. Hence, Waller is somewhat caught off-guard when an unexpected turn of events causes her plans to not work out the way she indented. This is most notable when Enchantress manages to outwit Waller - releasing her brother Incubus upon Midway City, knowing full well that Waller (not knowing of him being Enchantress' brother) would dispatch her to take the mighty metahuman down, which, in turn, would allow Enchantress to reach Incubus and (via his mystical empowerment) and become immune to her exposed heart weakness before Waller could stop Enchantress by stabbing said heart. This catastrophic error in judgement on Waller' part results in the metahuman duo wreaking havoc upon Midway City, forcing Waller to execute her FBI subordinates (due to their knowledge of this error of hers), and then turn to genius tactician Batman for help in the aftermath, so that he might help cover up her involvement in the matter, and keep the wrong people in the US intelligence community from finding out.\n\nHowever, while amoral, unempathetic, ruthless, and strict, everything Waller does is ultimately for the national safety of the United States and she is ultimately not ungrateful, as Waller notably rewarded the surviving Suicide Squad members for saving the world and rescuing her from Enchantress and Incubus by not only taking 10 years off of each of their respective prison sentences, but also even generously granting them some personal requests (granting the prison cells of Harley Quinn, Deadshot and Killer Croc an espresso machine, a punching bag, and cable TV respectively, as well as allowing Deadshot prolonged monitored visits to his daughter Zoe from time to time).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Amanda_Waller"}}

While initially reluctant to use his pyrokinetic powers out of guilt and fear, he would ultimately sacrifice his life in order to defeat Incubus and save the world from Enchantress.","Chato Santana was born on June 3, 1981, in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, California, into a family of Catholic immigrants from Mexico, and spent most of his childhood in the watchful custody of his grandmother. As the pyrokinetic powers he was born with slowly developed in strength with his age, he struggled to hide these abilities and curbed the temptation to use them growing up. But, this eventually led Santana to weaponize them to his advantage and draw him into getting involved in gang activity at age 17, moving up the ranks by stealing cars, dealing drugs and selling handguns. Becoming known as \"El Diablo\" on the streets, he was suspected, although never charged, with the murder of fifteen men in East Los Angeles. He thus realized that this might spike his dangerous abilities further and adjusted to the life of a family man, marrying a woman named Grace and fathering a son and daughter with her.  One evening, however, Grace came to discover her husband's criminal activities by finding a stash of money and pair of pistols in their closet, and confronted him about them. When the married couple had an argument with her threatening to take their children away to her mother's, El Diablo lost his temper and had a hard time controlling his pyrokinesis. This resulted in him setting their house ablaze, unwillingly killing both Grace and their two children. Devastated, a remorseful El Diablo handed himself over to police custody voluntarily, and was subsequently charged to life incarceration in a federal prison. Upon entering, he was jumped by several other inmates in the recreational area, prompting him to freak out and torch the entire area, killing those nearby. Deemed far too dangerous for a federal prison, the fiery homeboy was subsequently transferred to Belle Reve, where he was put inside a container capable of dousing fire.","At Belle Reve, El Diablo was approached by Amanda Waller and Rick Flag who showed him footage of him killing several inmates. El Diablo denied being the person in the footage saying that person is dead, frustrating Waller. Flag tried to talk to El Diablo but was shut down saying that he isn't going to fight again. Diablo then used his powers to display the word 'bye' to Waller and Flag.","When the squad had geared up, they were informed by Amanda Waller about their mission and what they are to do. If they were successful on their mission they would receive time off their prison sentence but if they fail, they would die. The squad gathered in a helicopter and were about to head off to Midway City when Katana joined them. The Suicide Squad crash-landed in Midway City and they made their way to retrieve Waller when Captain Boomerang and Slipknot attempted to escape. After witnessing Slipknot getting his head blown off, Rick Flag threatened the rest of the Squad.","The squad made their way to John F. Ostrander Federal Building where they made their way upstairs where they were ambushed by Enchantress' minions. Once again El Diablo stayed out of the way while everyone fought off the creatures which made Deadshot pull him aside and tried to get him to fight. Becoming angry with Deadshot having a go at him, he used his powers to eliminate all of the remaining enemies which shocked the squad on how powerful he is.","As the squad left the building they saw Harley Quinn still alive to their surprise. After being informed that Flag and Waller are responsible for Enchantress causing the destruction due to a failed mission, the squad decided to go to a bar and have a drink. El Diablo orders a water and they listen to Deadshot review the mission and that they are the ones who will be blamed. El Diablo then preached to Deadshot and told the whole squad about how he used to rule the streets and accidentally killed his wife and children.","He then pleads to the rest of the squad to reject the realities Enchantresses promises them (e.g. Deadshot killing Batman and Harley having a family with the Joker), telling them that it is not real. An enraged El Diablo then goes to confront the Enchantress, defiantly declaring that she can't control him or the squad. They are then attacked by Incubus who easily overpowers the group. El Diablo then volunteers to get Incubus in the corner so he can be blown up. Stating that he is not going to lose another family to Enchantress, he goes and fights off Incubus to protect the squad with his powers which temporarily affects him until he knocks El Diablo away.","El Diablo gets back up and uses his powers and transforms into a flaming skeleton avatar and manages to overpower Incubus and get him into the corner. He then thrusts his superheated arm right through Incubus' extremely durable chest, weakening him until his arm got stuck in Incubus' chest due to his healing factor and Incubus chokes him and reverts him back into his original human form. Flag tells him to get away from the bomb, but knowing that he can't, he tells Flag to blow the bomb killing both Incubus and himself. Chato saved the Suicide Squad and the world from Incubus' and Enchantress' decimating power."],"name":"El Diablo","description":"Chato Santana was initially a vain and opportunistic man prone to anger, as he notably used his pyrokinesis powers to his advantage, becoming a powerful and successful gang leader. However, Chato couldn't fully control his pyrokinetic superpowers when enraged, which ultimately resulted in him accidentally killing his wife and 2 children during an angry family spat. Devastated by his deed, Chato voluntarily surrenders to the authorities, and becomes a far more calm, collected, benevolent. and withdrawn individual than before, not ever wanting to kill another person with his powers again. Hence, El Diablo was the most calm and benevolent member of the Suicide Squad.\n\nHe initially refuses to join the Squad, and even after joining, initially is extremely hesitant to use his powers unless absolutely necessary. Despite being withdrawn though, Chato relatively quickly befriends Harley Quinn, Deadshot, and Rick Flag, and is quick to save them from Enchantress' mental probing, which he overpowers due to his superior mental fortitude (which came as a result of him having become skilled at holding back his rage). Ultimately, Chato dies heroically, going all-out with his powers (as a huge flaming avatar) and sacrificing his life in order to defeat Incubus and save the world from Enchantress.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/El_Diablo"}}

The question sparks quite a bit of controversy worldwide, with many being quick to express their opinions.\n\nTyson is seen on the talk show \"In the Moment\", along with Vikram Gandhi, discussing \"The Superman Question\". While Tyson is seemingly not opposed to the alien superhero, he astutely remarks that Superman's very existence challenges humanity's sense of priority in the Universe. Tyson recalls how Copernican Heliocentrism displaced Earth and restored the Sun in the center of the known Universe, and how Darwinian Evolution established that humanity was just one among other lifeforms, instead of being special on Earth. And now, with the emergence of Superman, humanity learns that it isn't even special in the entire Universe, as there is now an alien living among them.\n\nVikram seemingly doesn't disagree with Tyson's points, but he himself expresses a more open-minded and optimistic view - that while humanity must understand that Superman actually coming to Earth is a paradigm shift (since humans have always created icons in their own image, thereby projecting themselves onto Superman), he speculates that maybe Superman is not in fact some sort of \"Devil or Jesus character\", and is instead \"just a guy trying to do the right thing\".\n\nClark himself sees these interviews on television, and is visibly dismayed at Tyson's words.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson_(character)"}}

He and his wife Martha found a baby in a Kryptonian ship and they raised the baby as their own, naming him Clark Kent. Jonathan knew that Clark was destined for greatness.","Jonathan was born in Smallville, Kansas as part of a generation of farmers along with his brother, Harry Kent Jr.","In 1963, when Jonathan was only 12, he and his father managed to save the Kent Farm from a horrible flood by barricading off the farm. The family celebrated, with Jonathan's mother baking a cake for her son to award his heroism. However, the next day, he and his family learned that they had just diverted the flood water to the Lang Farm.","10 years later, at the age of 22, Jonathan married another local girl, Martha Clark on October 21, 1973. A year later, Jonathan's brother Harry died. Jonathan and Martha took over the Kent Farm and ran it together, but were unable to have children of their own.","As Clark grew older, he developed a strong bond with Jonathan, and also incredible abilities, such as invulnerability and superhuman strength. Fearing other people's reaction, Jonathan instilled in Clark the need to hide these abilities from everybody else and act away from attention.","When Clark turned 13, Pete Ross a boy in Clark's class, continually bullied Clark and Jonathan was there to help his son, reminding him to hide his abilities. That same day Clark and his class went on school trip and the bus went over a bridge and into a river. Clark used his abilities to save everybody on the bus with a few children seeing and telling their parents. Jonathan and Martha defended Clark saying there was nothing special about their son.  Later that day, Jonathan and Martha discussed revealing Clark's origin to him. Jonathan went to out to see Clark, reminding him that he can't reveal the special side of himself to anybody, and was morally torn when Clark asked if he should let people die instead. Jonathan decided to revealed to him that he came to from the stars. He took him into the barn and showed him his ship that was underneath revealing he is an alien, before reassuring Clark that he will always be their son. He gave Clark the Command Key that came with him to Earth and that he had been trying to figure out why Clark was sent to them and that Clark should try to find out the reason.","Four years later, when Clark was 17, the whole family was out in the car and stuck on a highway in traffic. When a large tornado began sweeping across the region, the family evacuated the car and Jonathan told Clark to get Martha to safety under a nearby bridge. Clark said that could help some of the people with his special powers but Jonathan was adamant that he needs to keep that side of him secret. Clark took a small child off of Jonathan and returned her to her mother while Jonathan tried to help others. Realizing he was about to die, Jonathan signalled Clark not to save him to keep his secret safe. Jonathan died as Clark and Martha, along with others, watched. Jonathan was buried in Smallville cemetery next to his brother Harry.","Jonathan's prediction of Clark having to make the choice about revealing himself, as well as that of Clark changing the world (as the alien hero nicknamed \"Superman\") both came true shortly thereafter as well. Due to the extraordinary heroics that \"Superman\" demonstrated while saving Earth from the malevolent General Zod and the Sword of Rao, Clark was ultimately accepted and greatly respected by most of the people of Earth (with Metropolis' citizens even building a massive silvery statue in Superman's honor), something Jonathan had feared wouldn't happen. An hence, as Jonathan had once wisely said, Clark now viewed his superpowers that had so plagued him as a child, as a blessing. Before moving to Metropolis and applying for a job at the Daily Planet, Clark and Martha remembered Jonathan fondly, with Martha assuring him that her husband had always seen the hero that Clark was destined to become.","2 years later, Jonathan's other prediction also came true - while many (notably Vikram Gandhi) viewed Superman with admiration and thankfulness, a great many others saw the godlike alien as the most controversial figure in the world, with Internet blogger Glen Woodburn worrying about humanity's horrible track record of following people with great power (down paths that led to huge human monstrosities); author Andrew Sullivan questioning whether there are any moral constrains on Superman (with International Law making every one of Superman's acts a political one); astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson notably remarking how Superman's very existence challenges humanity's own sense of priority in the Universe (much like how both Copernican Heliocentrism and Darwinian Evolution had previously done), and a political interviewer ultimately questioning Senator Finch if the world even needs a Superman.","After failing to stop the bombing of the US Capitol (orchestrated by Lex Luthor), Superman finally begins to doubt himself, and, believing that who and what he had tried to be right up until that very point to be \"just the dream of a farmer from Kansas\", he went into self-appointed exile. However, during this time, Clark saw a vision of Jonathan, who reminded his son of how he himself had once believed himself to be a hero after saving his farm a flood, yet inadvertently thereby flooding the Langs' farm. He encouraged Clark, and let his son know that he both loves and misses him. Encouraged by this vision and the relatability of his father's ordeal, Clark returns to Metropolis as Superman, just in time to rescue Lois from Lex Luthor."],"name":"Jonathan Kent","description":"Jonathan was an honest man who always believed in ethics and honesty during his life as a farmer, and he loved his adopted son Clark very much. Despite Clark being practically invincible, Jonathan was very overprotective of his adopted son, fearing that the world wouldn't accept Clark the way he and Martha did, and that his presence on Earth would change everything. Ultimately, Jonathan was so adamant to not to reveal Clark's secret to the world, that he died protecting it. However, he died confident in Clark's ability to learn the reason why he had been sent to Earth, and confident that Clark would one day \"stand proudly before the human race\" and \"change the world\".\n\nJonathan was even able to posthumously support Clark, since when the latter was deeply depressed about the accumulated repercussions of his own attempted heroics as Superman, Clark recalled that Jonathan had once been through a somewhat similar experience as a child, and the memory of this (which manifested itself as a vision) is able to convince him to return to Metropolis as Superman.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jonathan_Kent"}}

Indeed, Lundendorff was charismatic enough as a leader to instill immense loyalty in Dr. Poison, who ultimately refused to abandon him for Steve Trevor (who was undercover, posing as a ruthless German officer interested in her). Despite being usually calm, Ludendorff occasionally displays fierce wrath and rage when frustrated, such as when confronted and thwarted by Wonder Woman's sudden arrival.\n\nLudendorff sadistically romanticizes war (unknowingly thus worshiping the God of War Ares), believing that it serves a purpose of bettering individuals, and claiming that it demands human sacrifices. Indeed, due to this mindset, personality and enhanced physical condition, Wonder Woman originally believed him to be Ares in disguise.\n\nLudendorff was also quite intelligent and well-read, notably reading quite a bit of Ancient Greek literature, and being impressed when Diana Prince quotes him an author of that era. Indeed, he was an excellent military scientist, tactician and battle strategist, scouring both himself and the Imperial German Army multiple victories during the 4-year duration of World War I, being all the more effective due to his ruthlessness, as when several other high-ranking German officers opposed his views, Ludendorff unexpectedly wiped them out on the spot with a chemical weapon, and when Wonder Woman managed to free a Belgian village from a year of German occupation on the Western Front, Ludendorff promptly wiped the village out with the same chemical weapon. His intelligence, however, was occasionally undermined by his extreme arrogance and overconfidence, with Ludendorff even going so far as to claim that even Wonder Woman, while a magnificent warrior, was no match for him. This would prove to be Ludendorff's undoing, as Wonder Woman promptly proceeded to defeat and kill him.\n\nLundendorff also appears to have a sadistic sense of humor, as when he has Dr. Poison kill disagreeing German officers with her extra-lethal mustard gas, Ludendorff tosses in a gas mask, gleefully laughing at the prospect of the doomed officers not knowing that the mask would be useless against the horrific gas.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Erich_Ludendorff"}}

He waged a war on crime in Gotham City, beginning his long crime-fighting career 18 years before the Black Zero Event.","Bruce Wayne was born February 19, 1972, in Gotham City, New Jersey, to Dr. Thomas Wayne, a billionaire advanced technology and military defense developer, and Martha Kane-Wayne, an Irish-Catholic debutante. Bruce had an idyllic childhood, mainly due to his family's fortune and the love supplied by his parents. Growing up, he would be sat down on the floor of Wayne Manor's entrance room next to where the family crest was engraved by his father, who told him that despite the manor itself being built on railways, real estates and oil, the first generation of Waynes made their fortune as hunters, trading pelts and skins with the French.  On June 26, 1981, at age 9, Bruce and his parents were walking home from a family night out at the theater to see \"The Mask of Zorro\" when they are confronted by a mugger, Joe Chill, who shot both Thomas and Martha, killing them in cold blood right before Bruce's eyes. From then on, Bruce was raised by the Wayne family butler Alfred Pennyworth. His parents were buried on the grounds of Wayne Manor, but Bruce, overcome with grief, ran away from the funeral, falling into a cavern filled with numerous bats. This would later inspire him to use that fear to battle the criminal elements that took his parents' lives.","In the eventuating years, Bruce grew up inspired by bats to make himself a symbol of fear within the heart of crime in Gotham City, Bruce did so by training himself beyond the heights of mental and physical perfection, mastering many martial arts, the art of deception, tactical skills, and stealth, among many other disciplines. Bruce used this newfound workout and knowledge to take up the the persona of a fearsome yet heroic vigilante known as \"The Batman\" by launching a one-man war on crime at age 23, while also swiftly reclaiming control over his family company Wayne Enterprises as its CEO. The cavern with bats that he had once fallen into as a child inspired him to create the Batcave, an expansive subterranean residence housing all of his high-tech Batman gadgets, located under Wayne Manor.","Overall, Batman was initially about finesse, fully employing his immensely formidable skills of stealth and deception, hardly openly appearing at all, as evidenced when he caught Sal and tied him up from a tall building, and broke Pete Doumanian's legs, forcing the latter to permanently retire from crime. Indeed, Batman was so successful in his stealthily deceitful method, that even after his 18 years of protecting the city this way, there was hardly any tangible evidence of his existence, with some (notably Victor Stone) even assuming that Batman did not actually exist, and was nothing but an urban legend.","However, at some point before the Black Zero Event, the Joker and Harley Quinn managed to kill Robin together, and left a sadistic note for Batman, spray-painted in yellow on the damaged Robinsuit. A devastated Bruce hung Jason Todd's suit in the Batcave, as a monument to honor his comrade and to also remind himself of what he fights for. After the death of his protege, sidekick, and friend, Bruce became much more hardened and angered, morphing into a more relentless and violent version of Batman.","At some point during Bruce's career as a vigilante, Batman began tracking down the world's most wanted hitman, Deadshot, and ARGUS leader Amanda Waller proves herself a situational ally by anonymously giving Batman some crucial information on how to track the assassin down. Hence Batman finds Deadshot on the streets with his daughter Zoe Lawton. When the duo goes through an alley, Batman glides down and seizes Deadshot, telling the latter to surrender, not wanting to do anything in front of Deadshot's daughter. Deadshot attempts to fight off the vigilante, but Batman swiftly gets the better of him, beating Deadshot to the ground. Deadshot then promptly takes out his gun and attempts to shoot Batman, but Zoe stands in the way, crying that she did not want her father to kill anyone else. After a moment, Deadshot surrenders his gun and himself to Batman, who cuffs him to a gate and leaves him for the GCPD, who find him being hugged by a saddened Zoe.","Fierce crocodilian metahuman Killer Croc came to Gotham City and tried to form a criminal enterprise, however he was repeatedly confronted and defeated by Batman. Croc was so heavily on Batman's radar, that he was forced to flee the city, only to be later captured by Amanda Waller and her ARGUS SWAT team.","As the mighty aliens fought high above the city, Zod's heat vision tore through the Wayne Financial Building, causing it to collapse into ruins. A horrified Bruce screamed for Jack and ran towards the collapsing building while everyone else fled. Bruce searched for survivors, passing a group of frightened children and finding his employee Wallace Keefe trapped underneath rubble. Bruce and a few other employees there helped rescue the now paralyzed Keefe. Bruce then noticed a little girl staring at the building's ruins and saved her from getting crushed by debris. He told her that she would be safe and asked where her mother was, but she could only point to the now destroyed building before breaking down in tears. Bruce embraced and consoled the girl as he watched Zod and Superman continue their fight in the sky, coming crashing back down to Earth, in a mortal embrace. ","As a result of witnessing the incredible destruction and carnage unleashed by the Black Zero Event and subsequent duel of the mighty aliens, Bruce became more brutal as Batman, now resorting to breaking the legs of jewel thief Pete Doumanian, for instance, though he still refused to kill the thugs that he apprehended.","While at Wayne Enterprises, Bruce followed a Metropolis Middle School student, Zoe, who was watching a group of criminals using Kryptonian armor and plasma rifles, in to a restricted section of the building. He urged her to return to her group, as he would seek the \"proper authority\", but they were caught by the gang. Suddenly, Superman showed up, causing the criminals to make a break for it. The Kryptonian plasma rifles briefly held Superman back (though he was also unwilling to hurt them). Bruce then took down the guard watching him and Zoe, before activating a Kryptonian signal jammer, which let out a high-frequency screeching noise that subdued everybody, briefly including Superman. Given the opportunity to take out the criminals, Superman handed them over to the Metropolis Police Department, as Bruce praised Zoe for her courage, before returning her to her school group.","As Batman, Bruce was later chasing a group through the Carytown Crossing, in the movie and shopping district. He landed his motorbike on top of their car, causing them to crash, before subduing and tying them up. He ran from the scene, disappearing down a manhole. The following night, he located Emily, who had taken a photo of him. He acknowledged that she would do the right thing and destroy the evidence, disappearing into the night.","Batman then lays her down on the hood of the Batmobile and checks for a pulse, but does not find one. With extreme reluctance, Batman then does mouth-to-mouth to revive her. A pleased Harley then recovers and begins kissing him, but Batman resists and drives her to Arkham Asylum. ARGUS Director Amanda Waller then promptly had Harley transferred to Belle Reve supermax, where the female psychopath is put inside a small barbwire-powered electric cage fit for her aerial acrobatic routines.","2 years after the Black Zero Event, Batman rescues a group of young Asian women from sex trafficker Cesar Santos by subduing him and then ruthlessly branding him. One of Gotham City Police Department's rookie police officers tried to shoot him but the Dark Knight escaped, leaving Santos with a \"bat-brand\" on his chest. This would be only one of the many criminals branded by the Dark Knight, as there had been 18 reports of it in Gotham within the past month. Bearing a \"bat-brand\" is equivalent to a death sentence among Gotham City prison inmates, and later among Metropolis prisoners too. These actions within the prisons were orchestrated by Lex Luthor as a way to make Batman feel responsible for those deaths, as if he were a murderer, thus making Batman's madness and cruelty grow stronger, all in the hopes that this would catch Superman's attention and induce him to fight the Dark Knight.","Bruce has been searching for someone known only as the \"White Portuguese\", which, as he tells Alfred, is bringing in a dirty bomb to Gotham City. Bruce learns that a Russian man named Anatoli Knyazev may have information regarding the \"White Portuguese\", but even after interrogating 6 people as Batman, he learns nothing. Hence, Bruce Wayne later attends an underground fight club where he meets Knyazev. He and Bruce had a brief conversation, which allowed Bruce to successfully clone Knyazev's phone and discover that Knyazev worked for Lex Luthor. Bruce then expressed his intention to break into Luthor's house as Batman, but Alfred is quick to point out that that would be unnecessary, as Luthor has already invited Bruce to attend a fundraiser event. That evening, as Bruce prepares to depart the Batcave and attend the event, throws a glance at Jason Todd's damaged Robinsuit.","At that precise moment, however, they are abruptly interrupted by Lex Luthor, who enthusiastically introduces himself and invites Bruce to visit the LexCorp Industries research and development facilities. However, Mercy Graves comes up and lets Lex know that a governor wants to speak to him. As Bruce politely excuses himself and walks off, a suspicious Clark attempts to follow him (having heard Alfred's voice in the earpiece again), but he suddenly sees a TV news report of a girl stuck in a burning house in Mexico, and is forced to switch his clothes and depart. Bruce then breaks from the crowd, and tries to unplug his device, only to find it has already been unplugged by a mysterious antiques dealer named Diana Prince. Bruce follows after her, however she is able to leave the party before he can confront her.","Later, Bruce finds Diana Prince at the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities' exhibit of a fake replica of Alexander the Great's sword, where he angrily confronts her by grabbing her arm and asking her about the information she stole. Bruce claims to see right through her \"babe in the woods\" act, saying that while she doesn't know him, he's met \"a few women like [Diana]\" (a possible reference to Harley Quinn among them). Diana, however, calmly smiles and claims to be sure that Bruce has never met a woman like her. She then proceeds to tell Bruce that she was unable to obtain anything due to the data having military-grade encryption. Diana explains that she stole the information because Lex Luthor had a picture that belonged to her. Before excusing herself, Diana then lets Bruce know that she only borrowed his device, and has already returned in to him shortly beforehand, placing it into his car.","Bruce began to experience a form of a nightmarish dream, seemingly a vision of a possible apocalyptic future - the Injustice War. A devastated Superman kills thousands, and is driven by his incredible grief and despair to become dark and malevolent, taking over the Earth as its iron-fisted ruler, founding the Regime Stormtroopers army to aid him in his totalitarian Regime of Earth, killing anybody who opposes him. A visibly more aged Batman, in desert clothing, exits a bunker, and watches his Insurgency allies approach. He meets with them and asks for the Kryptonite rock, the last hope of defeating Superman. However, it turns out to be an ambush and Batman is held at gunpoint. He follows through with their commands as the undercover Regime Stormtroopers reveal themselves to Batman and the Insurgency. They execute them, as Batman watches helplessly. Angered, he begins a one-man assault on the Stormtroopers. Although he manages to take down most of the stormtroopers while Parademons invade the area and abduct many of his resistance fighters, Batman is eventually overwhelmed by the remaining stormtroopers there who could barely restrain him. He snaps one of their necks but then is brutally (but barely) beaten down and restrained by the other stormtroopers. Seeing the damage that Batman was inflicting on the Regime Stormtroopers and their inability to restrain him, a Parademon knocks him unconscious.  Batman recuperates chained up in the bunker with his remaining Insurgents, eyeing them helplessly. Superman himself then lands in the bunker, and his Regime Stormtroopers reverently knee; before their leader. He approaches Batman, swiftly murdering the last Insurgents with his heat vision. Superman then unmasks the infuriated, but also visibly scared vigilante. He expresses his anger at Bruce for letting \"her\" die, as she was \"his world.\" Superman gives Batman one final sneer, and brutally kills him by tearing Batman's heart from his chest. At this point, Bruce awoke from this nightmare to find a distorted and unstable blue portal of electricity right in front of him. Inside it, the Flash appeared, and gave Bruce a distorted warning, to fear a person referred to as \"him\" (whom Bruce had \"always been right about\") and that Lois Lane was \"the key\" to this. Flash then suddenly realized that he is \"too soon\", so then, before the portal disappeared, he begged Bruce to find \"them all\" and save \"her\". Bruce abruptly awoke again, though he did not believe that either experience was entirely a dream.","Having awoken from his nightmare, Bruce examines the decrypted data and realizes that Lex Luthor is not only experimenting with Kryptonite, but also investigating metahumans. One of them is Diana Prince herself, who is revealed to actually be an immortal Amazon warrior Wonder Woman (as a photo of her together with Steve Trevor's team in World War I Belgium in seen). The others are the mysterious mighty Atlantean warrior Arthur Curry, the powerful speedster Barry Allen, and the cybernetically enhanced Victor Stone. In the process, Bruce also realizes that the \"White Portuguese\" is actually a ship, rather than a person. Bruce then promptly admits to Alfred that he plans to steal the Kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman.","While intercepting Lex Luthor's men transporting Kryptonite, Superman interrupted the chase, damaging the Batmobile after Batman tried running him down and again when Superman tore the doors off. Superman (enraged by the death of Cesar Santos and the helplessness of using words to stop Batman's vigilantism) threatened the Dark Knight, warning him to give up his crusade (to ignore the Bat-Signal the next time it is shined into the sky), and that he should consider Superman's warning mercy, meaning that disobedience will carry severe punishment. As he turned to leave, Batman countered with a threat of his own, expressing his determination to make the godlike alien \"bleed\". Not impressed with Batman's threat, Superman flew off, while Batman promptly drove back to the Batcave in the damaged Batmobile. Back home, Batman tracked the Kryptonite to LexCorp Industries, with the intention of stealing it from there shortly thereafter.","Later that evening, induced by the red notes and recent events to finally take offensive action against Superman, Batman breaks into the well-guarded LexCorp Industries building, successfully steals the Kryptonite from within, while seriously injuring all of the guards (swooping down on them from above, like an actual bat) despite their tireless attempts to shoot him (evidenced by the numerous cartridges lying on the floor in the aftermath), leaving a batarang in the empty Kryptonite container (for Lex to see), as well as a considerable trail of destruction.","In order to be at his absolute peak during the upcoming duel, Bruce also pushes his body to its physical limits with many intense workouts in his Batcave - dragging an extremely heavy truck tire from a considerable distance, hitting the aforementioned tire very hard with a huge sledgehammer numerous times, performing many pull-ups with extremely heavy weight plates chained to his dipping belt, bench-pressing more than a thousand pounds on a barbell, easily performing complex presses with extremely heavy dumbbells, and finally, pushing an already extremely heavy cart (loaded with dozens of large weight plates) for a large distance.  With his physical preparation complete, Bruce retreats to mentally prepare at the abandoned Wayne Manor, where he is found by Alfred, who once more attempts to implore Bruce to stop, claiming that Batman cannot win such a confrontation, with it being \"suicide\". Bruce grimly responds saying that he is now older than his father Thomas Wayne had ever been, and that this might be the only thing Bruce does that actually matters, since despite Batman having defeated numerous Gotham City criminals and supervillains over the last 20 years, \"criminals are like weeds\", in that if 1 is pulled up, another grows in its place, while Superman has the potential to become the most formidable supervillain in history, so taking him down before that happens is \"about the future of the world\", something Bruce sees as \"[Batman's] legacy\". Bruce then grimly muses at how his father had once told him that despite the Wayne Manor itself being built on railways, real estates and oil, the first generation of Waynes had made their fortune as hunters, trading pelts and skins with the French. Thus, Bruce not only hopes to live up to his father by taking Superman down, but also feels kinship with his ancestors, as a hunter of sorts. This grim reasoning, coupled with the future Flash's message, absolutely cements Bruce's resolve. As Bruce walked away, Alfred, understanding that trying to stop the former is hopeless, bitterly remarked that \"So falls the House of Wayne.\"","Batman taunts Superman as the latter grows weaker. Superman attempts to fight back, but Batman takes full advantage of Superman's now weakened state and his own superior fighting skills, easily countering Superman's attacks and crashing through the skylight to the lower floor by stomping hard on a downed Superman. However, Superman begins to recover from the Kryptonite poisoning at this point, as he powerfully countered Batman's increasingly ineffectual attacks, even knocking him to the lower floor with a mighty tackle. As more of his strength and powers continued returning, Superman easily hurls Batman through multiple walls to the ground and charges at him, with Batman grabbing Superman in mid-air and slamming him against a wall, proceeding to punch him hard. However, more and more of Superman's powers return, so Batman's armored punches begin to lose effectiveness quickly. Signs of fear start to show on Batman's face, and Superman promptly tackles him to the ground, hurling Batman through multiple walls, to the ground again. As Batman sees Superman ready to charge at him again, he, in desperation, fires another Kryptonite gas grenade at Superman, just as the latter was leaping into attack. With his suit now damaged from the final attack, Batman grabs a bathroom sink and smashes it on the once again weakened Superman's head, knocking the latter unconscious.","Batman lifted Superman up by his hair and placed him over his shoulder, proceeding to carry him to the missing floor, where he threw Superman several stories down. Batman then grappled to the bottom himself, and wrapped the wire from the gun around Superman's ankle. Picking up the grapple gun, Batman dragged Superman to the open area in the building. He deduced that Superman's parents taught him that he meant something and that he was there for a reason. However, Batman's parents taught him a different lesson. Batman activates a button on the gun, which yanks Superman towards him. Batman tosses him around the building, through the pillars. A badly defeated and wounded Superman lands on a pile of rubble and debris as Batman finishes telling him what his parents taught him, that the world only made sense \"if you force it to\". With that, Batman grabbed the spear and kicked Superman onto his back. He placed his foot on his throat, choking him, telling him that he was never a god, or even a man. Batman then used the spear to cut across Superman's face (making good on his promise to make Superman \"bleed\"), and raised it, preparing to deliver the killing blow.","Superman, unable to escape, urged him to save \"Martha\", telling him that he has her and to find him, which caused Batman to mentally flash back to the night his parents died. Confused and enraged, Batman demanded to know why Superman had said that name. At that precise moment, Lois Lane, having arrived by helicopter, rushed in and begged Batman to stop, telling him that Martha is the name of Superman's mother. Shocked, Batman came to his senses, finally realizing that Superman was in fact a selfless person pleading for the life of his mother instead of his own instead of an monstrous alien threat. Furthermore, Batman saw the hypocrisy of his own actions - that he has allowed Lex Luthor to twist his anger from the Black Zero Event and turn him into the very villain he swore to fight. Angered, ashamed and horrified at the monster that he had almost become, Batman hurled aside the spear in disgust, and resolves to help Superman stop Lex Luthor, the true enemy. Superman and Lois then explain the situation to Batman, concerning Martha Kent's kidnapping by Lex Luthor, and her currently running out of time. Putting his tactical genius back to use, Batman insists that Superman to go back to Metropolis, while he would go after Martha, promising him that she wouldn't \"die tonight\".","Upon making his way to the room Martha Kent was held in by Anatoli Knyazev and one of his thugs, Batman had a stand-off with Knyazev himself, who threatened to kill Martha. Batman said that he believed him, promptly shoots the Russian's flamethrower's tank, seemingly killing Knyazev. Batman, however managed to shield Martha from the explosion with his fireproof cape, and attempted to calm her down, letting Martha know that he was a friend of her son. She, however, has already realized this, claiming that Batman's cape let her know of his allegiance (due to it being somewhat similar to that of Superman). Batman flew off on his Batwing as soon as he saw the Gotham police approach Martha, leaving her in safe hands.","Shortly thereafter, a recovered Superman returns from space, tackles away Doomsday, and asks Batman if he'd found the Kryptonite spear, to which the Dark Knight grimly replied that he had been \"a little busy.\" While initially somewhat confused over who Wonder Woman is (incorrectly assuming at first that she was an ally of Batman's, that the latter had brought along), Superman proceeds to jointly attack Doomsday in tandem with her, while Batman keeps his distance, and persistently tries to expose the monster to Kryptonite, which would exploit its only known weakness. He successfully hides behind some stone rubble at one point, avoiding Doomsday's electric shock-wave.  Batman, having successfully shot Doomsday with Kryptonite.Taking advantage of Doomsday's limited intelligence and tremendous bloodlust, Batman baits him into charging at him (managing to grapple away just in time), successfully dodges an ensuing huge thermal blast from the monster, and lures it closer to Wonder Woman, allowing her to get her unbreakable Lasso of Truth around Doomsday's torso. As she strains to hold the mighty monster in place, Batman fires his last Kryptonite gas grenade at Doomsday, temporarily weakening him, and giving Superman to crucial opening the latter needed to stab the monster with the Kryptonite Spear. Unfortunately, while the monster is mortally wounded, an enraged dying Doomsday manages to pierce Superman's chest with his huge arm-protrusion, mortally wounding him as well. Both combatants release one last thunderous bellow of agony, before their lifeless and pierced bodies collapse.","Sometime later, Batman visits the Belle Reve jail cell of the imprisoned and now shaven-headed Lex Luthor, expressing his extreme rage at Lex for his actions including how he deceived him. Batman pins him against the wall and threatens Lex with his branding ring, but Luthor boldly counters by sneering and revealing that he knows Batman's secret identity, but that nobody would believe him, as Lex is perceived to be insane. Batman then reveals to a dismayed Lex that he has arranged for the latter to be taken to Arkham Asylum and that some \"friends\" will be there for him. Lex, however, swiftly regains his composure, sneers again, and states that \"God\" is now dead, and due to that, there is something else, something and someone bigger coming, from outer space. Batman then defiantly punches the wall with his branding-ring, leaving the mark of a bat symbol on the wall. When Luthor turns his head back, Batman disappears. He yells at the Dark Knight in defiance, that the bells are ringing and warns that \"he's\" coming to Earth, after that Lex began to mimicking the bell sounds, mockingly.","Bruce and Diana remain at the cemetery afterwards, and Bruce, guilt-ridden over having \"failed [Superman] in life\" (mainly due to Bruce's horrible actions against Superman, and due to Bruce having wasted 2 Kryptonite gas grenades on him, while they might have instead been used to kill Doomsday without losing Superman), asks her to help him honor Superman's heroic sacrifice by helping him bring together the three metahumans from Lex Luthor's file (the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg), in case a threat of that scale ever should arise again. Diana inquires why Bruce is proposing it. He replies that it is simply due to a feeling he has that things will imminently get worse (in reality, he was following the instructions given to him by the future Flash that appeared in one of his \"dreams\", as well as heeding Lex Luthor's enigmatic warning).","After her Suicide Squad successfully defeats the mystical duo of Enchantress and Incubus in Midway City and save her, Amanda Waller meets up with her situational ally Bruce Wayne, asking him to take care of the rumors following the aftermath of the calamitous events, and in exchange, she gives Bruce her files on multiple notable metahumans, including that of Enchantress, Aquaman, and the Flash. As Bruce turns to leave, Waller lets him know that she is aware that he is Batman, and he, though somewhat surprised, sternly warns Waller to shut down Task Force X, letting her know that if she doesn't, he and his new \"friends\" will shut it down for her.","Since Diana Prince has returned to her job at the Louvre Museum after Superman' funeral, Bruce stayed in touch with her, hoping that she would consider his offer. He eventually discoevered the original physical photograph of Diana with Steve Trevor's team, and send it to her in a Wayne Enterprises package. A tearful Diana e-mails Bruce back, thanking him for returning Steve to her (as it was the only photograph of them together that was ever taken).","Bruce learned from Amanda Waller's files that Arthur Curry visited a village in Newfoundland,Canada, (as a mysterious \"stranger from the sea\") during the winter, bringing fish to feed the hungry, always coming on the King tide. On the day right after the King tide, Bruce arrives at the village and asks to speak with Arthur. When Arthur reveals himself to be there, standing among the villagers, Bruce lets the latter know that an impending enormous threat is coming to the world, and asks Arthur to join the Justice League under his leadership. Arthur, however, is hostile, proceeding to angrily lift and pin Bruce against the wall, ultimately refusing to join. After Bruce returns to Diana following the unsuccessful recruitment, he merely tells her that Aquaman had \"more or less\" agreed to join. When she presses him further, asking if that means \"more more, or more less\", a somewhat saddened Bruce admits to Arthur having declined.","With the help of Amanda Waller's file, Bruce tracks down and sneaks into the apartment of Barry Allen shortly before the latter returns, and introduces himself to the young metahuman (whom he recognizes as the past version of the scarlet time-traveler that appeared in his \"dream\"), though the latter is still confused. Bruce then promptly hands Barry a printout of the security camera tape he found on the LexCorp Industries files. Barry instantly recognizes himself in the photo and tries, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the person (him) as someone who looks like him, Jewish and someone who drinks milk, claiming that he does not do so himself. Bruce surveys his apartment and tells Barry that he knows he latter has abilities, but just needs to know what they are. Barry nervously rambles about his personal skills, including competitive ice dancing. Short on patience, Bruce hurls a batarang at Barry as hard as he can, which the latter effortlessly dodged and catches. Barry is awed after realizing that Bruce is actually Batman, and dismisses Bruce's claim of him being fast as an \"oversimplification.\" Bruce then continues, telling him about the team that he is putting together, and almost immediately, Barry wants in. Bruce is momentarily confused, but he gladly accepts his decision. Barry, admiring the batarang, asks Bruce if he can keep it."],"name":"Batman","description":"Bruce Wayne is very determined and dedicated to his work of crime-fighting vigilantism (due to having been forced as a young child to watch his parents get murdered by Joe Chill), sometimes employing illegal and morally dubious tactics (like torture, much to the chagrin of Superman, causing him to initially view the former as a brutal and unforgiving criminal) while fighting crime as Batman, but ultimately for the good of Gotham City. Being skilled in the art of deception, Bruce often hides his true dark (almost sociopathic) personality by maintaining a façade in public - while still serious and intelligent, he purposefully comes off as a somewhat arrogant womanizing playboy (notably trying to brush off reporter Clark Kent in order to flirt with Diana Prince), so as to avoid anyone from suspecting that he could possibly be the fearsome Batman. Bruce's deception also extends itself to his alter ego, since as Batman he strives to fool the criminal underworld of Gotham City into thinking that he is an inhuman and supernatural being, akin to a wraith. Hence, several female sex trafficker victims of Cesar Santos notably mistook Batman for a \"Devil\", and Cyborg initially even doubted Batman's existence. Alfred Pennyworth, however, notes that Bruce has never been skilled at deceiving him, as he has known Bruce since the latter was a child. Other than Alfred, however, the only other individual known to see through Bruce's genius deceptions is Lex Luthor.\n\nAlthough possessing great disgust and anger towards criminals and supervillains (most notably the Joker and Harley Quinn after they murdered Jason Todd), Batman, like the other Justice Leaguers, has proven himself a very caring and selfless person, in addition to being incredibly brave, constantly putting his life on the line to save innocent lives (notably when he fearlessly ran straight into the clouds of falling debris in Metropolis, managing to save a little girl) and bringing the most dangerous criminals to justice for society's protection. He also risked his own life to rescue Martha Kent, and did nothing to Zoe Lawton, despite the latter being the daughter of the notorious Deadshot. However, despite being a situational ally to Amanda Waller and promising to protect her from any compromising rumors about Midway City, Batman is adamantly against her Suicide Squad idea, and threatens to have his Justice League friends shut it down for her unless she does it first.\n\nBatman, as a tremendously skilled and well-rounded vigilante and polymath genius (in tactics, deception, criminology, science, engineering, hacking, business, exploitative networking, and martial arts, as well as both inductive and deductive analysis), has bettered himself both mentally and physically to his peak, without any superhuman assistance, thereby making him capable of pulling off terrific feats without actually being superhuman. Hence, Batman epitomizes many of the humanist beliefs of Lex Luthor, who somewhat admires him, despite being Batman's enemy and business rival, and Lex therefore selects Batman to be his (discreetly manipulated) champion against Superman and the metahumans. While his exceptional intellect and extensive experience make Batman wise, they also make him slightly vain, as he notably condescendingly calls the younger Clark Kent \"son\" upon first meeting the latter, though this might have also been part of his Bruce Wayne playboy façade. Despite being a polymath genius, however, Batman was still in many ways considerably intellectually surpassed by supergenius Lex Luthor, who easily manipulated Batman as a pawn in his grand scheme to destroy Superman.\n\nBatman's strongest characteristic had originally been his strong moral code to never kill (notably not even killing the Joker and Harley Quinn after their murder of Robin), until he became considerably more hardcore in his approach to fighting crime in Gotham City, after witnessing the Black Zero Event first hand. It is believed that a combination of emotional and physical pain, loss, exhaustion, and potential disillusionment he\u2019s experienced during his time protecting the streets of Gotham, as well as his growing cynical, pessimistic, and world-weary personality, caused Batman to view his former methods as too lenient (referring to his formerly held belief in their effectiveness as a \"beautiful lie\"), and to decide that he was better off letting his enemies die than allowing them to return and cause more harm.\n\nHence, after the Black Zero Event, Batman seemingly has no regard for the safety of his enemies, as he has repeatedly crashed and wrecked vehicles with enemies still inside using the Batmobile, as well as using both its guns and the Batwing's to cause explosions near enemies, usually by blowing up nearby vehicles. He has also caused explosions in which enemies were caught in, such as by knocking grenades near enemies, or using a stolen machine gun to ignite Anatoli Knyazev's flamethrower when he was about to kill Martha Kent, causing it to explode and seemingly engulf everyone in the room, though he shielded Martha Kent from the blast with his cape and saved her, as promised. It should be noted, however, that Batman's involvements with the deaths of criminals are more like manslaughter, which are obviously caused by his enemies themselves while trying to hurt him, with him only using lethal force against them in response to them using it against him first. Therefore, Batman never has actually killed anyone in the eyes of the law.\n\nIn addition to having abandoned his no-kill rule, Bruce tends to be extremely suspicious of others, especially those in possession of great power, since he notably claimed that even if there is only a one percent chance of the alien Superman being a potential enemy of humanity, that it has to be taken \"as an absolute certainty\", due to the incredible destruction and carnage that the tremendously powerful alien could potentially unleash if he were to become corrupted by evil. This very cynical point of view on Bruce's part comes from him having seen \"what promises are worth\" many times during his two decades as Batman, having seen many seemingly benevolent individuals become malevolently corrupted, to the point that Bruce claims that hardly any \"good guys\" are left anymore (making it more than a mere one percent chance of Superman's corruption in his eyes), in addition to the fact that the only other Kryptonians (General Zod and his loyalists) who arrived on Earth had attempted to wipe out all life on the planet in a terraformation apocalypse. As a result, Batman perceives Kryptonians as having a natural predisposition towards evil, and he therefore fears the possibility of General Zod's level of evil gradually developing in the only other member of the latter's race still to be on Earth - Superman (whom Bruce disdainfully refers to as \"an alien\" in a conversation with Clark Kent). Hence, despite his brilliant intellect and extensive experience, Batman, after 20 years of relentlessly fighting crime in Gotham City, is shown to have become a damaged, fearsome, and almost sociopathic individual. Alfred Pennyworth explained it as fear and rage being able to gradually render a good man like Batman into a cruel one, due to the paradigm shift that the revelation of Superman's existence had brought about. This newly darkened aspect of his personality ultimately allowed Batman to be outsmarted and manipulated, though supergenius Lex Luthor is notably the only one known to have ever successfully done so, due to him being one of the extreme few individuals to surpass Batman in intellect. Lex did so by using Batman's inner rage and demons against him, secretly finding ways to provoke Batman past the point of rational thinking, with Lex claiming that it had been easy to \"push [Batman] over\" and make him his pawn. When combining his own personal fear of and prejudice towards Superman due to the Black Zero Event, with Wallace Keefe sending him angry notes (actually from Lex Luthor), with Lex making it seem that Superman had blown up the DC Capitol, with Bruce feeling both the need to live up to his father Thomas Wayne (to do something that would actually matter to the whole world) and kinship with his ancestors (the first generation of Waynes, who were hunters, somewhat like him now), along with a horrifying message from a possible potential future (sent by that future's version of the Flash) where Superman ruled Earth as a ruthless tyrannical overlord (along with Flash warning Batman to fear \"him\", someone Batman had \"always been right about\", interpreted by Batman to mean Superman), Batman ultimately resolved to take matters into his own hands by pitting himself against Superman in battle, intending to kill the latter before he could potentially become an incredible threat.\n\nIn the ensuing ferocious battle, Batman uses every tool in his ungraded arsenal against Superman, from a fierce Armored Batsuit, automated machine guns, sonic emitters and lead smoke grenades, to a spear and gas grenades containing Kryptonite, and even a re-purposed kitchen sink. After finally managing to weaken Superman and having him at his mercy, Batman proceeded to brutally (even somewhat sadistically) beat the alien hero, pummeling him with his armored fists, hurling him through concrete pillars, and cutting Superman's cheek with the Kryptonite spear, making good on his promise to make Superman \"bleed.\" As he placed his armored foot onto the fallen Superman's throat and prepared to kill him, Batman taunted his enemy, claiming that the alien had never been a God or even a man. However, when Superman uses (what he thinks will be) his dying breath to beg Batman to save his mother Martha Kent rather than beg for his own life, Batman is shocked and able to come back to his senses in the nick of time, finally realizing that Superman is in fact a selfless person instead of an monstrous alien threat (concluding that he must have misinterpreted future Flash's message, as it would be utterly impossible for this to be a ruse on Superman's part), with the fact that their mothers share the same name (\"Martha\") enabling Batman to see Superman as being fundamentally just as human as himself, despite his alien heritage. Furthermore, Batman saw the hypocrisy of his own actions, since while he had formerly claimed that Superman needed to be destroyed due to the possibility of him becoming malevolently corrupted, Batman had ultimately become malevolently corrupted himself (just as Alfred had previously pointed out to him), become the thing he swore to stop, which had made it easier for Lex Luthor to manipulate him into egregiously killing the son of Martha, much like how the thug Joe Chill had once orphaned Batman himself, the son of another Martha. In addition, Batman's prior belief of Kryptonians having a natural predisposition towards evil was invalidated when he learned of Lex Luthor's hand, as Batman realized that tremendous evil need not necessarily come from an alien, with him having been deceived this whole time by a supervillain considerably more evil than General Zod, one who was a fellow human of his. Angered, ashamed and horrified at the mislead monster that he had almost become, Batman hurled aside the spear in disgust, apologizes to Alfred, and atones for his mistake by first rescuing Superman's mother, and then teaming up with Superman (and Wonder Woman) to save the world from Lex Luthor's monster Doomsday. After witnessing Superman's selfless self-sacrificing death at the hands of Doomsday (whom Superman managed to kill with his dying breath as well), Batman is visibly shell-shocked and saddened, guilt-ridden about being so devastatingly wrong about Superman (whom he had ironically wanted to kill less than 2 hours earlier), whom he acquires a great deal of posthumous respect for.\n\nFeeling guilty about failing Superman in life (having wasted 2 Kryptonite gas grenades during his duel with Superman, while they could have instead been used to help kill Doomsday without Superman's death being necessary), Batman becomes determined not to fail him in death, by bringing together and leading Aquaman, Cyborg, and the Flash, together with Wonder Woman, thus forming the Justice League, which posthumously honors Earth's greatest hero by protecting the now vulnerable world against any formidable threats. In addition, Superman's noble self-sacrifice has inspired and given Batman a more optimistic and hopeful outlook, since he says to Wonder Woman that despite their many flaws, men are still good, and that they do in fact have the potential in them to rebuild and improve (the motto of Superman's House of El). Indeed, Batman is now able to see that Superman was \"a beacon to the world\", one who didn't just save people, but also \"made them see the best parts of themselves.\" This renewed hope in himself and humanity induces Batman to turn away from his former murderous methods, accepting his no-kill rule once again, and resolving to base the Justice League on friendship when founding it, unlike Amanda Waller's leverage-based Suicide Squad, with Waller herself calling him out on this.\n\nBatman, while usually very serious, prim, and even somewhat gloomy, is a charismatic mentor and leader, having lead his Batman Family vigilante proteges (Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl) in numerous vigilante escapades and missions, and even being mentally prepared to gather together the Justice League's first roster and lead them against the impending Parademon invasion. On rare occasions, Batman even demonstrates a dry, dark and sarcastic sense of humor, notably when alone with Alfred, when Lex Luthor (believing himself to be speaking with Anatoli Knyazev) asked him to \"break the bad news\", Batman responded by saying that \"[he]'d rather do the breaking in person\", when Batman claims to Flash that being rich is his superpower, and when Batman tells Cyborg (who initially doubted his existence) that \"[he]'s real when its useful.\" Batman's serious nature also leads to him initially getting annoyed with new Justice League recruits Flash and Aquaman, due to the former's humor, and the latter's dry remarks about his Batsuit.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Batman"}}

She gradually fell in love with him, and the Joker got Harleen to do him favors, which was giving him first a stuffed kitten, and then a machine gun. Shortly thereafter, Joker's bizarrely dressed goons (lead by Jonny Frost) broke into Arkham Asylum, and successfully aided their boss in escaping, tying Harleen down in the process. Before leaving however, Joker sadistically subjected Harleen to shock therapy (as a retaliation for her shock therapy leaving him \"in a black hole of rage and confusion\"), fracturing her psyche and causing intense psychological trauma. Thus resulting in her severe mental instability.","From that point on, Harleen dubbed herself \"Harley Quinn\" (donning a red-and-black Harlequin costume), and the duo of psychopathic lovers would go on a number of crime sprees in Gotham City together, which would often result in the duo coming into conflict with Batman, becoming (as Amanda Waller would later claim) the criminal King and Queen of the city.","At some point prior to the Black Zero Event, the Joker, with help from Harley Quinn, managed to kill Batman's partner, Robin. To add injury to Batman's loss in hopes of driving his adversary insane, Joker spray-painted \"HAHAHA JOKE'S ON YOU BATMAN\" in yellow on the Robinsuit. A devastated Batman would later place the damaged and vandalized suit in an exhibit in the Batcave.","In 2014, a year after the Black Zero Event, a lavish strip club owned by the Joker was visited by crime boss Monster T, whom Joker greeted, though he refused to shake his hand (as per usual, as Joker's right-hand man Jonny Frost revealed). Monster T, however, welcomed his fellow crime boss ally back, congratulating Joker on his escape. However, Monster T then took notice of the exceptionally beautiful Harley Quinn, and promptly made distasteful remarks about her, proceeding to stare with lustful desire, an act that greatly displeased the Joker. In response he called Harley over, intimidating Monster T, and making him somewhat uncomfortable by suggesting he sleep with Harley, as well as calling him a \"handsome hunka hunka\". Monster T, having picked up on Joker's displeasure, attempted to assure him that Harley was his girl, and that he wanted \"no beef\". The Joker, however, was unimpressed with the man, and promptly shot Monster T in the head.","Eventually in 2016, after becoming increasingly bored and unhappy without Batman, who left Gotham City to begin establishing the Justice League, and, most of all, his beloved Harley Quinn, Joker, who by this point had taken to drawing an accented black smile around his mouth to keep up appearances, began deploying his numerous goons to track down her location. Eventually, Jonny Frost returned and revealed that she is imprisoned in Belle Reve supermax prison. Exuberant at the news, Joker ordered Frost to get his car, and proceeded to lie down on the floor of his chambers, amidst his collection of numerous bladed and firearm weaponry, roaring with gleeful psychopathic laughter (and washed off the black line shortly thereafter).","Ultimately, Captain Griggs' torturous interrogation prove effective, as he revealed to Joker Amanda Waller's plan to use Harley Quinn as a member of the Suicide Squad (with an intended mission in Midway City), as well as the implantation of an ARGUS nano-bomb into Harley, as an emergency contingency. Griggs ultimately agreed to lead the Joker into the facility where ARGUS' nano-bombs are created. The Joker ultimately also forced him to return to Belle Reve and deliver a purple phone to Harley (through which he could communicate with her, via SMS) before she was deployed on the Squad's mission.","Satisfied with his progress, Joker sends Harley an SMS, letting her know that he's close.","Later, the welcoming helicopter arriving to the ARGUS headquarters (for extracting Amanda Waller from the hands of Enchantress) was revealed to have been hijacked by the Joker, Jonny Frost, and his goons, and they opened fire over the Suicide Squad, while Dr. Van Criss simultaneously disabled Harley Quinn's bomb, allowing her to climb aboard the chopper (after informing her of this by SMS).","When Harley Quinn's mind was telepathically assaulted by Enchantress, the latter implanted a vision of Harley being married to Joker, with both of them being without their dyed hair, bleached skin or tattoos (and apparently also cured from their psychopathy), the two of them having two baby kids (a boy and a girl), and living a happy \"Normal\" life in a suburban home. However, with the help of the more mentally resistant El Diablo, Harley was able to snap out of it and continue her attack against the evil army.","After the Suicide Squad had managed to defeat and kill Enchantress, her brother Incubus, and her monstrous army, they were all re-imprisoned in Belle Reve, albeit with their sentences shortened by 10 years and their cells rendered more comfortable in gratitude (with Harley notably gaining an espresso coffee machine)."],"name":"Joker","description":"The Joker is an extremely malevolent and evil individual, being a complete psychopath (albeit on the highly functioning end of the spectrum) with seemingly no regard for human life, and a ruthless sadist that takes sadistic pleasure in torturing others to achieve his goals, evidenced by when he (with help from Harley Quinn) brutally murdered Robin, and left a jocular spray-painted message for Batman on the damaged Robin suit, as well as when the Joker playfully implanted a nano-bomb into Dr. Van Criss' neck, even after the latter had agreed to comply due to the Joker already having the man's wife hostage. His dark and twisted personality makes Joker find humor or sport in the suffering and fear of his enemies, and Joker himself is seemingly impossible to intimidate, due to his pathological fearlessness.\n\nJoker is also remarkably manipulative, thus easily psychologically enthralling Dr. Harleen Quinzel and commanding the respect and loyalty from all of his Joker's gang goons (who don't hesitate to break him out of Arkham Asylum), in addition to being extremely intelligent and unpredictable, thus managing to torment his archnemesis Batman for years, and to catch Amanda Waller off-guard by sabotaging her ARGUS helicopter. In addition, Joker appears to be somewhat vain about his status as the very top of Gotham City's criminal underworld, evidenced by him forcing the imprisoned Captain Griggs to kiss his hand, and proudly refusing to shake Monster T's hand upon meeting him. Joker also uses sexuality to intimidate and unnerve his victims, sitting on Grigg's lap and stroking him, as well as calling Monster T a \"handsome hunka hunka\" when he offered Harley to him.\n\nJoker also has a penchant for flamboyancy, lavishness and extravagance, evident in him complementing his bleached white skin with dyed green hair, lipstick, and eye-liner (giving himself the appearance of a fearsome clown); his bright and flashy Jokermobile (in stark contrast to his archnemesis' Batmobile), as well as the outrageous outfits that Joker sometimes has his goons wear - one of them sporting a goat's head mask, another wearing a mask of a giant eyeball, another in a full-body panda suit, and yet another dressed up in a mockery Batman outfit.  Despite his psychopathic malevolence, on some level, Joker seems to reciprocate Harley Quinn's strong romantic love and infatuation in his own twisted way (possibly due to her being one of the extremely few people to rival his own psychopathy, with him thus feeling a kindred spirit in her), being exceptionally distressed after losing her (drawing a black smile around his mouth), being very possessive of her (promptly killing Monster T after the gangster made remarks that she was a \"bad bitch\"), is desperate to rescue her from the clutches of Amanda Waller, and is exuberant during their reunion, happily kissing and embracing his girlfriend, claiming that he would do anything for her. Despite these feelings he has still been known to physically abuse her and leave her for dead when backed into a corner (such as when he left her underwater to drown).\n\nThe only predictable aspect of the Joker's criminally insane psyche is its inherent unpredictability. Joker describes himself as \"an idea, a state of mind, who executes [his] will according to [his] plan.\" Hence, given the chance, he will kill and kill again, but how, why, when, and whom he will kill cannot be anticipated, sometimes even by genius detectives Batman and Commissioner Gordon. His reasons and methods are not necessarily random, but are so quixotic and impulsive they may as well be.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Joker"}}

Deadshot would later be forcibly recruited into Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad, and he greatly contributed to the defeat of the Enchantress and Incubus mystical duo, getting his prison sentence shortened and allowed to frequently visit his daughter as a result.","At age 25, Lawton sought to learn the better use of a firearm by training as an expert marksman in the US Special Forces before leaving to become a gun-toting vigilante back in Gotham, codenamed \"Deadshot\". Regularly boasting to \"never miss\", he attempted to replace the masked vigilante Batman as the city's protector, but the Dark Knight luckily exposed his actions of working with criminals to distract the police from more serious crimes, having him arrested.","When Deadshot was on hire for a criminal organization to kill a informant in police custody who was about to testify against the organization, he set up a hardened reflective panel in front of the courthouse and waited for the police convoy to arrive. Deadshot called his employer Angelo, and demanded that he get paid immediately before killing the informant. As the convoy arrived and Deadshot threatened to call off the hit, he received his payment of $1 million up front. However, for being rude to him, Deadshot then demanded that Angelo double the payment. Through manipulation, Angelo begrudgingly doubled Deadshot's payment to $2 million. Satisfied, he cocked his wrist-mounted gun and fired a bullet from atop a tall building, perfectly striking the reflective panel and killing the informant. With his job complete, he put on his white mask and fled the scene by rappelling down the building.","In December of 2015, after hearing of Deadshot, Amanda Waller becomes a situational ally of Batman, giving the latter some crucial information on how to track the assassin down. Hence, while Deadshot is walking down the street with his daughter Zoe, Batman suddenly glides down and seizes Deadshot, telling the latter to surrender, not wanting to do anything in front of Deadshot's daughter. Deadshot attempts to fight off the vigilante, but Batman swiftly gets the better of him, knocking Deadshot to the ground. Deadshot then promptly takes out his gun and attempts to shoot Batman, but Zoe stands in the way, crying because she did not want her father to kill anyone else. After a moment, Deadshot surrenders his gun and himself to Batman, who cuffs him to a gate and leaves him for the GCPD, who find him being hugged by a saddened Zoe who proclaims she loves her father while he says nothing. He is subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment at Belle Reve in Louisiana where he is subjected to abuse from the prison guards there including Captain Griggs.","In 2016, nine months after Griggs took over as his main guard at Belle Reve, Deadshot is rotting in prison where he is often mistreated by the guards of Belle Reve especially Griggs who feeds him disgusting food and beat him regularly. While alone in his cell, he thinks about the last words his daughter spoke to him that \"She loves him, even though he does bad things.\" Later, Amanda Waller gathers skilled individuals and metahumans for Project Task Force X. While being coerced into joining the team, Deadshot personally displays his sharpshooter skills in front of Rick Flag, Waller, Griggs and others in an attempt to negotiate that he be released and his daughter Zoe Lawton should be well provided for including a free ride to an Ivy League University in exchange for his services.","While mid flight enroute to their destination, Deadshot sees Harley communicating by text to the Joker with a phone that was given to her by a coerced Griggs. Harley signals for Deadshot to be quiet about it and he decides to comply. When Harley notices the other worldly distrubance caused by Enchantress, Deadshot asks Flag what happened and the latter lies calling it just a terrorist attack. This causes Deadshot to call him out as a bad liar. Lawton states he is a killer and hitman and he is not in the business of saving people. Flag remarks Lawton will do anything for pay. After Lawton snaps back Flag \"knows the dark places too.\" Flag proudly declares he is a soldier and that Deadshot is a serial murderer for hire and that when the shooting starts Lawton will \"just cut and run.\" as he thinks nothing of the hitman. When their helicopter is shot down, the squad is forced to travel the rest of the way on foot, splitting up with Squad B, who safely lands their helicopter nearby. After Captain Boomerang talks Slipknot into foolishly attempt escape, getting the latter killed in the process by Flag, he asks who will die next and threatens Lawton. Afterward, Deadshot and Harley bond (with her referring to him as her \"Friend\" and He calling her \"Doll Face\" ) and plot against Flag to turn the odds in their favor the first chance they get.","Soon after, the group encounters weird looking creatures in the Enchantress' employment known as the Eyes of the Adversary. Flag again threatens to blow Lawton's head off if he runs away when Deadshot inquires about the mutated creatures. When Deadshot and Flag, and the others approach them, the creatures become hostile and attack. The squad are initially overwhelmed as the monsters capture Flag, much to Harley's delight. Knowing the Squad members are as good as dead if the colonel is injured or killed, Deadshot reminds her of what Waller had said about that and leads his teammates to rally and turns the fight in their favor as Flag is recovered. By himself, he stands on a car and guns down a number of creatures, leaving even members of the US Army in awe of his skills.","Once the group reaches the intended floor, Flag asks to continue into a secured room alone to retrieve the target, Deadshot states their rescuee better \"cure cancer\" after all the trouble they've gone through. Initianally, Flag and the target, revealed to be Waller herself, talk but are soon joined in conversation by Deadshot. Lawton is present as he and Flag witness Waller murder every single member of her FBI special ops team because they didn't have \"clearance\". He calls Waller \"a mean lady\" for the cold blooded murders.","Inside the bar the Suicide Squad drowns their sorrows about the end of the world. Deadshot makes a toast to \" honor among thieves\" prompting Katana to declare she's not one. Deadshot reminds everyone that they will be blamed for everything. When Harley asks what his deal was with Flag was, he admits to being offered his freedom and his daughter. An angry El Diablo explodes and says Lawton allowed himself to be used by Flag. Lawton states he knew, but allowed it so he could have hope. El Diablo states that hope doesn't stop karma and that it's coming for him and asks Deadshot how many victims he's killed. Along with the rest of the squad a defensive Lawton listens as Santana admits to killing his wife and kids in a fit of anger when he burned down their house. Shocked and horrified Deadshot tries to get Harley to back off Santana when she proclaims it was destined to happen because people like them do not get a normal life. As the group continues to talk and drink as the world ends, they are joined by Flag who extends an olive branch to the group by destroying the nano detenation device. He shows Deadshot what he was saving for after their mission was successful, letters from his daughter Zoe who writes him daily. Angry about that being kept from him, yet inspired and wanting to show his daughter he's a worthwhile person and not just a killer for hire, Deadshot vows to help Flag complete the mission and save Waller along with the rest of the world. As Deadshot, rejoins the mission Harley follows his lead stating that she too will help and urges Katana, El Diablo, and Killer Croc to do the same. They are even rejoined by Boomerang soon after he initially bolted.","The Suicide Squad and Special Ops team come up with a tenative plan to take on Incubus and Enchantress deciding to take out the former first with a demo charge. As they make their way to the final confrontation, Flag confides in Deadshot he never believed in the concept of love until he met June Moone and he's afraid she may be lost to him. Deadshot tells him to do whatever he has to do to avoid that and that he has his back. Deadshot goes to Diablo to make sure he will fight with them and not hold back, assuring a relunctant El Diablo they may actually have a chance at success if he fights with them as the group's most powerful metahuman. As they approach Enchantress, she is aware of their prescence and invites the group to come out into the open to face her. Deadshot grabs Harley to stop her from foolishly confronting Enchantress too soon, and points her gun away from his face as they hide with Flag behind a pillar. In order to persuade the Suicide Squad to side with her, Enchantress feeds them visions of their hearts desire. For Deadshot personally, envisions killing the man he blames for his incarceration, loss of his daughter, and everything else ...the Batman. Instead of being arrested the night of his apprehension, he instead imagines ending the Batman's life that night and avoiding the loss of everything he held dear mainly his wealth, daughter, and freedom. When, El Diablo is able to see past Enchantress's visions, he helps the others break free of the illusions as well including Deadshot.","When Harley brilliantly distracts Enchantress and cuts out her heart, Deadshot calls for her gun and he's able to target and shoot a charge thrown by Killer Croc at the heart of the mistical machine destroying it and saving the world from further destruction. This was accomplished despite a last ditch effort by Enchantress to make Deadshot see an illusion of his daughter to convince him not to shoot. He immediately tells Rick Flag to back off when he tries to hug him after his incredible shot. Flag has to kill Enchantress by crushing her heart after she refuses to bring back Dr. June Moone. Deadshot is the first to call out to Flag after he notices June still alive beneath the Enchantress husk. As Lawton returns Harley's gun to her, and the pair plot to steal a car to drive back together to Gotham City. However, Waller reemerges with a functional nano detonation device and informs everyone the only place they are going is back to Belle Reve. Deadshot wants more than just 10 years of his prison sentence and demands to see his daughter again. Waller agrees to Lawton's request and accepts special requests from the other Suicide Squad members as well in return for them saving the world.","As Waller promised, Deadshot continues to have regular visits with Zoe."],"name":"Deadshot","description":"Deadshot is portrayed as a consummate professional: as long as he's been paid to kill someone, he will always carry it out, without exceptions or mercy. He is also sarcastic and have a personal method where he has to be paid first to get his job done and will threaten his employers furthermore when he is offended, evidenced by wanting double the original pay for his job because his \"client\" was being a \"dickhead\"; alongside of his sarcasm, he has an incredibly tough attitude, and can work even under the highest of pressure.\n\nDespite his sarcastic, tough attitude, Deadshot notably strikes up a friendship with Harley Quinn quite quickly, empathizes with El Diablo after learning the latter's dark secret, is greatly respected by his fellow teammates, and has influence over them (with Rick Flag himself pointing this out), and finally he cares deeply for his beloved daughter Zoe, keeping a picture of her with him throughout his time as an assassin and inmate. He also holds a strict code about not killing women and children in his line of work, thus proving himself to have a strict moral compass. Notably, when Amanda Waller attempts to psychologically manipulate Deadshot by promising him freedom and a permanent reunion with Zoe in exchange for assassinating Harley Quinn, he is strongly tempted for a few long moments. Ultimately however, with quite a bit of visible effort, Deadshot realizes his unwillingness to betray his moral code of not murdering women, as well as his friendship with Harley (most likely also due to him realizing that Zoe wouldn't have ever approved of the circumstances of such a permanent reunion if she knew), and so he resists, instead pretending to miss while shooting at Harley (thou Deadshot may be willing to make exceptions, to his moral code in some situations, as he plotted with Harley to kill Rick Flag and Katana and contributed to Enchantress' defeat).\n\nDeadshot also seems to dislike physical contact, as he was visibly uncomfortable upon being hugged by Rick Flag, and insisted upon not being a hugger.\n\nAlso, while not outspoken about it, Deadshot appears to be at least somewhat religious, wearing a cross while in civilian apparel, and having several biblical verses written on the gauntlets and neck of his combat bodysuit.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Deadshot"}}

When asked by Prince about his reasons, Wayne merely commented, \"Just a feeling,\" (In reality, he was heeding the words of the time traveler in his \"dream\", as well as Lex Luthor's cryptic warning).\n\nAfter the events in Midway City were succesfully foiled by the Suicide Squad, Amanda Waller met up with Wayne and requested that he protect her from rumors regarding the Midway City attack, which Wayne complied to in exchange for the metahuman files Waller was rumored to have collected, with the files of the Aquaman and Flash among them. He then told her to shut down the Task Force X program, stating that \"my friends and I\" would handle any future problems, before using the files to track down the metahumans he needed.\n\nBatman, greatly inspired by Superman's death and sacrifice, heeded the warnings of the scarlet time traveler, and began a campaign to recruit members of a team powerful enough to protect the world in wake of Superman's demise. With the aid of Wonder Woman, he set forth on researching potential candidates, utilizing the files gained from Amanda Waller to narrow his search.\n\nSometime after reviewing Waller's files, Bruce Wayne would travel to a remote fishing village in Canada, where he's traced reports of a man who comes in during the winter to bring fish to the hungry, said to arrive during the King tide. He speaks to the village's counsel, where he deduces the stranger is among them, later revealed to be Arthur Curry. When Wayne states of the impending threat and offers Curry a place on the team, Curry initially reacts with hostility, lifting Wayne up and slamming him against a wall, ultimately refusing to join. A somewhat disheartened Wayne later recounts this experience to Diana Prince. It is hinted, however, that Curry would change his mind once something bad happens.\n\nBruce Wayne also tracks down Barry Allen to his home in Central City, were he breaks into and waits in Allen's \"second favorite chair\" until he gets home. He introduces himself to a dismayed and confused Allen (whom Wayne recognizes as the past version of the scarlet time-traveler that appeared in his \"dream\"), promptly handing him a printout of the security camera tape he found on the LexCorp files. Allen instantly recognizes himself in the photo and tries, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the person as someone who merely looks like him, Jewish and someone who drinks milk, claiming that he himself does not do so. Wayne ignores Barry's failed attempts at deflecting, surveying his apartment, where he noticed the speedster's scarlet suit, and informed Allen that he knows he latter has abilities, but just needs to know what they are.\n\nAs Allen nervously rambles about his personal skills, including competitive ice dancing, Wayne suddenly hurls a batarang at him as hard as possible, but Allen uses his speed to dodge and catch it. Recognizing it, an awed Allen deduces that Wayne is Batman. Wayne, in turn, responds by stating that Barry is fast, to which the latter calls an oversimplification. Wayne then begins to tells Barry about the \"team\" he is putting together, but before he finishes, Barry accepts, stating his answer for \"needing friends\". Wayne is momentarily confused, but he accepts his decision. Allen, who up until this point has been admiring the batarang, then asks Wayne if he can keep it.\n\nTo be added\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Justice_League"}}

Millennia ago, Zeus created the Amazons, specifically Wonder Woman, as a fail-safe Godkiller against Ares's own power. Ares would ultimately instigate and win the War of the Gods, killing all other Olympian Gods, but also forced to temporarily retreat for centuries in the process. Ares spent many years influencing humanity to create weapons which he hoped they would use to destroy each other. Ares would then reappear during World War I, taking the disguise of Sir Patrick Morgan, and inspiring Dr. Poison to develop a powerful and deadly gaseous weapon, which desired to use to destroy humanity, a race which he had developed bitter jealousy for. In the end, however, Ares' plans were thwarted, with Wonder Woman killing him and ending World War I and his violent influence over humanity for good.","Ares was born millennia ago to Zeus, King of the Olympian Gods, as one of the latter's many godly children.","Ares viewed the human race that Zeus created with disdain, and began corrupting them with war, blood-thirst, and violence. Zeus responded by creating a new race - the Amazons, who were intended to protect humanity from Ares' influence, while spreading love and compassion. Ares, however, violently rebelled, starting the War of the Gods on Olympus, which resulted in him killing off the other Olympian Gods for disagreeing with his bloodthirst and extremism. Ultimately, when only Zeus was left, he faced Ares in combat and defeated him, but was mortally wounded in the process. Before Zeus died, he fathered Diana (as a contingency weapon that could one day save humanity by defeating Ares) by Hippolyta, and created the protected island paradise Themyscira for the Amazons to live, hidden from the God of War.","Now, as the sole surviving unopposed Olympian God, Ares again proceeded to corrupt humankind with war, determined to wipe the race out, but that ultimately proved ineffective. Hence, at some point, Ares came to Earth, disguising himself as an elderly and kindly human named of \"Sir Patrick Morgan\", and became an advocate member of the British War Council. Secretly, however, Ares would support the German General Ludendorff, slyly inducing him and Dr. Poison to create an extremely deadly gas, which Ares intended to use for wiping out humanity for good.","Against the wishes of the committee, Ares later on met with Steve and the rest of his compatriots at a local bar, and showed his support for a raid by providing them enough funds for a halfway transport to Belgium, earning their gratitude.","After Trevor, Diana, and the rest of their team discovered a large bombing facility manufacturing and loading mustard gas to be used against the Allies, Ares decided to take matters into his own hands. Transporting himself to the facility, \"Sir Patrick\" finally shed his disguise and revealed himself to Diana after she killed Ludendorff, whom she falsely believed to be the God of War. He went on to agree with his half-sister's recent sentiments that humanity doesn't deserve the help of the Olympian Gods, but instead destruction. Ares then began stating his reasoning behind everything he had done up to that point. After retrieving the Godkiller sword from Ludendorff's dead body, Diana attempted to strike at him, but Ares simply held his hand out and disintegrated the weapon, stating that the sword wasn't the Godkiller; Diana herself was.","The God of War then regrettably engaged his half-sister in combat, beginning by destroying the tower they were in and sending Diana flying. Seeing that she survived, he began telekinetically trying to slam her with metal slabs on the ground, but she dissuaded these efforts. Ares noted the naivete of his half-sister as she tried to whip him with the Lasso of Truth, simply creating strong winds to blow it away and dodging a slab toss by hovering in the air. He then attempted to crush Diana with an uplifted chunk of concrete, but she easily dodged and hit him with her bracelets. Tossed away, Ares stopped a box filled with explosives from reaching him, but Diana caused an explosion by simply throwing another box, temporarily incapacitating the both of them.","Ares condescendingly threatened Diana and attempted to force her surrender, but Diana bore witness to Steve's selfless suicide by blowing up the plane of mustard gas, making her send out a shock-wave that threw Ares back. The God of War then began seeing her combat the German soldiers with great anger, and he began his platitude once again in the belief that Diana finally saw from his point of view and continuing to state humanity's weakness and rush to violence, even stating Trevor's heroic sacrifice as him leaving Diana. She threw her fists into Ares' face, only for him to push her back and summon Dr. Poison's car, tossing the mad scientist out as use as a final counterargument to Diana. Fully angered, Diana nearly crushed Poison with a tank until she looked back on Steve's final words. Poison escaped as Diana approached her half-brother, saying that while humanity is indeed everything Ares says they are, they are also more than meets the eye."],"name":"Ares","description":"Ares, as the God of War, is extremely violent, bloodthirsty, selfish, sinister, and egregiously malevolent, willing to wipe out humanity (by instigating the devastating World War I and then utilizing Dr. Poison's immensely deadly hydrogen mustard gas), and ruthlessly killing off all of the other Olympian Gods in the War of the Gods when they opposed his hatred of humanity, even killing his own father Zeus without remorse. Ares is purely evil and irredeemable, a far more sinister villainous leader than General Zod, as he doesn't hesitate to turn against his allies when they are no longer useful to him (such as Dr. Poison), and even against his own family, remorselessly murdering his own father Zeus when the latter stood in Ares' way. Indeed, Ares' loyalty is only to those that can be more useful to him than others, as he only aided the Central Powers of World War I and General Ludendorff primarily because Ludendorff shared Ares' own sadistically romantic view of war (the position that war serves a purpose of bettering individuals, and demands human sacrifices), and because Dr. Poison's inventions offered him an easier way of wiping out much of humanity. Overall, however, Ares genuinely views himself as an altruist, given his belief that without humanity existing on Earth, the planet would be a paradise.\n\nAres is also extremely intelligent and divinely wise, given his tremendously long godly lifespan, allowing him unparalleled insight into humanity's darker traits, something no other Olympian God had, apart from Ares' father Zeus. Hence, even when not utilizing his divine powers, Ares is still extremely dangerous and absolutely lethal.\n\nDespite his violent and bloodthirsty nature though, Ares (much like Lex Luthor after him) is a deceptive genius who can expertly hide it under a persuasive façade of calmness, kindness, perceptiveness, as well as his persuasive rhetoric, with Ares also usually not desiring to fight individuals who could be useful to him otherwise, like Wonder Woman. Indeed, while posing as the human \"Sir Patrick Morgan\", Ares deceived not only Wonder Woman, but even the highly experienced spies Steve Trevor and Sameer into believing that he was a staunch Allied Powers supporter, with him notably funding Steve Trevor's team for their military expedition to find and defeat General Ludendorff, with Wonder Woman never suspecting \"Sir Patrick\" until Ares willingly reveals himself to her.\n\nAres is also a phenomenal demagogue, with the usage of divinely wise and seemingly rational arguments making Ares' method even more effective. Hence, even after revealing himself and his motives to Wonder Woman, Ares claimed to be \"the God of Truth, not War\" (notably saying this while restrained by the Lasso of Truth), and was still quite persuasive in presenting his viewpoints (him not actually being her enemy, and humanity being inherently malevolent and destructive even without his influence), to the point that it gave even the determined Wonder Woman some pause before she could even respond. As such, Ares succeeded in riling up Wonder Woman to a ferocious display of violence, and (by insulting Steve Trevor's sacrifice) almost got her to murder Dr. Poison.\n\nAres' greatest weakness is his occasional overconfidence and arrogance (much like it is for Enchantress, General Ludendorff, and Amanda Waller), with the God of War believing that his phenomenal divine power and ability to enhance himself from violence makes him practically unbeatable. This ultimately becomes his downfall, as Diana is able to use her non-violent emotions of love and compassion to overpower and defeat Ares, fulfilling her role as the Godkiller.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ares"}}

However, while Superman would always remain an ally to both America and all of Earth, he requested that it be done on his own terms, and that he trusted Swanwick's ability to convince Washington D.C. of that.

During his attempt to terrarform, the Wayne Financial Building where Keefe worked in collapsed. Present at the time, Keefe attempted to evacuate people from the building before it began to crumble.\n\nBruce Wayne, just arriving in the city got to the ruins of his building. He entered the rubble looking amongst it for any survivors. There, he found Keefe, his legs trapped underneath rubble, before joining a few others at freeing him. Keefe was rushed in to get medical care, though the lower halves of his legs had to be amputated, resulting him to lose his job. Shortly after the amputation, his wife left him, as their daughter was among those killed during the catastrophe.\n\nHaving lost his job and his family, he became embittered towards Superman. Despite losing his job, he was compensated with monthly paychecks, but he returns them with messages encouraging Bruce Wayne to retaliate against Superman. This suggests his family did not leave him due to his disability, but due to him losing his sanity. 18 months later, he was arrested for vandalizing the statue of Superman in Heroes Park.

He is the current owner and CEO of LexCorp Industries. Lex Luthor also becomes the archnemesis of Superman, whose very existence makes Lex feel threatened, which makes the malevolent supergenius go out of his way to expose the godlike alien superhero as a fraud, and to subsequently destroy him, by first pitting Superman against Batman, and then his monstrous creation Doomsday. Lex, however, is ultimately jailed as a supercriminal for his exposed numerous unspeakable crimes, first in Belle Reve supermax, and then in Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.","While publicly popular and affable, Luthor Sr. was a very cruel and despicable man behind closed doors, with Lex later remarking in outrage that no \"man in the sky\" would ever come to save him from \"[his father's] fists and abominations\". This induced a traumatized Lex to gain a militantly misotheistic view of God, believing that if He were omnipotent, then it would be logically impossible for Him to be omnibenevolent and vice versa, thereby solidifying his belief that power cannot be innocent (referring to the antithesis of that as the \"oldest lie in America\"), and that all individuals with great power and popularity must be evil by definition.","Shortly before the release of his company's revolutionary new operating system Lex\/OS, Lex Luthor was approached by reporter Ron Troupe, and agreed to meet him for 15 minutes at the opulent Royal Penthouse Suite at the Park Metropolis Downtown. Lex was then promptly interviewed on a number of subjects, including the alien hero Superman and the Gotham City vigilante Batman. Right afterwards, Lex offers to play bowling with Troupe, confident in his ability to \"destroy\" the latter.","After Hanford Technologies was successfully exposed by Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane, Lex arrived at a construction site of the company, and announced that LexCorp Industries was purchasing all of Hanford's holdings (including the site), as well as retaining all of Hanford's employees, as he claimed that the employees should not suffer from the immoral actions of their former CEO. Lex proceeded to admit that despite his failings, Mark Hanford had been a good CEO, whose big mistake was selling illegal Kryptonian technology. Later, in the privacy of his car, with only his personal assistant Mercy Graves there to hear him, Lex finished - because there were so many more interesting things that could potentially be done with it.","Due to Lex Luthor's prolific philanthropic efforts to help financially support the rebuilding of Metropolis (as well as his company, LexCorp Industries), local politicians and media personalities called the companies that left Metropolis traitors, while a growing number of corporations (including Kord Industries), inspired by Lex Luthor, decided to follow his example, with some of them who had previously planned to pull out of Metropolis reversing course, and others, that had never been in Metropolis at all, choosing to expand there. In addition, while funding the rebuilding of Metropolis, Lex also had the Lexor Hotel built, thus naming it after himself. Indeed, due to his actions, some even claimed that Lex was as much a hero to Metropolis as Superman himself. Lex, however, dismissed the comparison, claiming that the alien superhero was a figure too mysterious and controversial for him to be a good comparison, but in light of Superman's debut, Lex claimed that recognizing the importance of the \"ordinary\" citizens of Metropolis (such as rescue workers, first responders, and countless ordinary citizens, who also helped save others in the Battle of Metropolis) had become more important than ever.","During this time, Lex had a woman named Teri meet with Professor Garcia and another man, who discussed the video footage of Superman saving a runaway train full of passengers. Teri spoke the words spoken to her through an earpiece by Lex (who had her appear to agree with Garcia), while the latter viewed the entire meeting from another CCTV screen.","Hence, it would be around this time that Lex learns everything about Batman and Superman (notably their alter-egos, powers, abilities, physical and emotional weaknesses, relationships, and psychological profiles), as well as that of other metahumans: the immortal Amazon demigoddess Wonder Woman (a World War I era photo of whom, together with Steve Trevor's team, which he obtained with facial recognition software), the Atlantean Aquaman (footage of whom he found in the Pacific with UUV drones), the speedster Flash (footage of whom he obtained from a Central City pharmacy's security camera with an increased frame rate), and the technologically enhanced Cyborg (footage of whom he obtained from a video log on the S.T.A.R. Labs database).","In order to carry out his plan, Lex employs Anatoli Knyazev and his men, arms them with innovative alloy bullets, and orders them to murder all of the men of the Nairomian terrorist warlord Amajagh as soon as Superman arrives (to save a captured Lois Lane), and for Knyazev to mutilate the corpses with his flamethrower, in order to make it look like Superman had murdered them with his heat vision.","Lex Luthor himself is visited at LexCorp Industries by senators Finch and Barrows, and he proposes to them the idea of using the recently acquired Kryptonite xenomineral as an official \"silver bullet\" deterrent against Superman, to hold him in check if the alien superhero were to ever decide to turn against humanity. In order to forge such a \"silver bullet\", Lex requests Finch to grant him an import license for the large piece of Kryptonite (nicknamed \"Emerald City\" by Lex) lying in the Indian Ocean (at the wreckage of General Zod's World Engine). Finch leaves, considering the request, while Barrows stays, clearly intrigued by Lex, and intent to continue a discussion.","Finch promptly tells Lex that she's decided not to grant him the import license. Lex is visibly enraged and sneers, beginning to nervously tap his fingers, begins to tell her what he considers to be the \"oldest lie in America\", but Finch physically stops him, letting Lex know that she sees right through his altruistic façade, telling him that he can \"Take a bucket of piss and call it Granny's peach tea, take a weapon of assassination and call it deterrence\", but that she wouldn't \"drink it.\" Lex gives her a sinister grin, and states that he has considered turning an old picture of his father's (depicting a battle between Heaven's angels and Hell's demons) upside down (leaving the demons above, seemingly prevailing over the angels), and enigmatically telling her that \"the Red Capes are coming.\" Finch then promptly departs.","Lex, as the event's organizer, is therefore invited to make a speech. In it, he mentions the poor origins of his father, Alexander Luthor Sr. (who had once had trouble affording books in East Germany), and makes an allusion to the Ancient Greek story of how the Titan Prometheus was brutally punished by Zeus, King of the Olympian Gods, for enlightening humankind (much to the visible chagrin of Diana Prince, Zeus' daughter). Near the end of his speech, Lex acknowledges the \"bittersweet truth\" that knowledge is power, but he then suddenly stumbles over his words, internally realizing their contradiction when applied to him. Lex is then quick to end his address and excuse himself from the stage, successfully covering up his blunder.","Lex then has Knyazev organize Cesar Santos to be murdered by his fellow Blackgate Penitentiary inmates, while Lex himself pays the bail of embittered cripple Wallace Keefe (who was in the same prison as Santos) and invites him to visit his villa. Lex wants Keefe to testify against Superman in the upcoming Senate committee, and he gifts Keefe with a motorized wheelchair (made of an innovative metal alloy) to sweeten his deal.","With Finch and Barrows out of the way and most of the public in hateful opposition to Superman, Lex finally uses the fingerprints of General Zod to enter the Fortress of Solitude, and re-insert Zod's command key into it, bringing the dormant starship online again. The AI's voice inquires if Lex intends to assume command, to which he answers affirmatively, though Lex is visibly somewhat nervous at first.","While Doomsday is still forming, Lex continues his first contingency plan by having Knyazev's men kidnap Martha Kent, and later kidnap Lois Lane and bring her before him, to the top of LexCorp Tower. When joined by her, Lois angrily confronts Lex about the innovative metal fired during the Nairomi Incident, and calling him psychotic. Lex, however, dismisses that as a mere \"3 syllable word for any thought too big for little minds.\" He then seemingly digresses, starting to talk about circles and triangles, eventually ending with Euclid's triangle inequality: \"the shortest distance between any two points, is a straight path. And I believe the straightest path to Superman is a pretty little road called Lois Lane.\" As he utters the last word, Lex promptly pushes Lois off the ledge of LexCorp Tower.","Lex's grandiose contingency plan is ultimately successful, as Superman is ultimately killed while taking down the monstrous Doomsday, to the dismay of Batman, Wonder Woman, and Lois, who all witness his final heroic sacrifice.","As they enter the Fortress of Solitude's Genesis Chamber, the team briefly sees Lex sitting in front of a Liquid Geo projection of the massive alien New God Steppenwolf, holding three Apokoliptan Mother Boxes. However, the projection is dispersed almost at once, and Lex turns, to face them, with guns aiming all at him. The supercriminal surrenders without a fight.","Shortly after his imprisonment in Belle Reve supermax prison as a supercriminal, Lex Luthor (now shaven-headed) is unexpectedly visited in his jail cell by Batman, with the latter expressing his anger at Lex's actions, pinning the malevolent supergenius against a wall and threatening him, but Lex boldly counters, by sneering and revealing that he knows Batman's secret identity, but that nobody would believe him, as Lex is perceived to be insane. Batman then reveals to a dismayed Lex that he has arranged for the latter to be taken to Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane. Lex, however, swiftly regains his composure, sneers again, and states that \"God\" is now dead, and that there is something else, something bigger coming, from outer space. Seething with rage, Batman punches the wall with his branding-ring, leaving the mark of a bat symbol on the wall. When Lex turns his head, he sees that Batman has disappeared. He yells at the Dark Knight, that the bells are ringing, and gleefully warns him about Steppenwolf's arrival on Earth and then he begins mockingly mimicking the dinging sounds.","As the CEO of LexCorp Industries, Lex Luthor has earned himself a phenomenal fortune (considerably expanding upon that which he has inherited from his father, Alexander Luthor Sr.), making himself one of the wealthiest people in the world, rivaled only by extreme few (like his business rival Bruce Wayne), with Lex renting the opulent Royal Penthouse Suite at the Park Metropolis Downtown (with 11 lavish bedrooms, each with its own floor-to-ceiling Italian marble bath, a 100-seat cinema\/lecture hall, a four-lane bowling alley, twin helipads and its own private Caffè Bene) just for his 15 minute interview with Ron Troupe, greatly financially contributing to the post-Black Zero Event rebuilding of Metropolis (naming the new Lexor Hotel after himself in the process), and with Perry White fearing that if threatened by Lois Lane through the press, Lex could sue the Daily Planet \"out of existence\" with his tremendous funds. Also, his inheritance and wealth allows Lex access to some of the most sophisticated technology in the world, as well as some other useful equipment, some of it innovative and futuristic. These resources, along with his immensely formidable hacking (enough to discreetly learn classified secrets from the CIA, FBI, DARPA, ARGUS, and S.T.A.R. Labs databases) and exploitative networking skills (enough to influence prominent politicians, other powerful companies, intelligence agencies, and criminal underworlds), allow Lex to be extremely well-informed in regards to individuals (be they human, metahuman, or otherworldly) who could potentially pose a threat to him (allowing Lex to keep discreet tabs on all of the future Justice League members, among others), along with Lex's knowledge of many, classified, global security secrets. Hence, Lex is one of the extreme few to know the secret identities of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, and the Flash, being one of the extreme few to know of Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad idea before it's implementation, and also being the first known human on Earth to learn the Fortress of Solitude's knowledge of 100,000 alien worlds (thus learning of Doomsday, and of Darkseid's imminent invasion)."],"name":"Lex Luthor","description":"Lex Luthor has a tremendously brilliant supergenius mind, quite possibly the greatest mind in the world (in many ways considerably intellectually superior to even most geniuses), though it is hideously corrupted by his cruel and traumatic upbringing, horrifically unstable ego, and low morality, as well as his egoistical nature of pure malevolence and megalomania, thereby making Lex as malevolent as he is intelligent. While he puts on a kindly, witty and charming façade that he is an altruistic humanist, a man of and for the people (with Lex comparing himself to the enlightening gift-giving figure of Prometheus, and supporting it well with his superb demagogic skills), Lex is actually full of rage, psychopathy, sadism, and ruthless malevolence behind closed doors, truly wishing to obtain ultimate power for himself, to control others, and to destroy those that he deems as his competition - namely his archnemesis Superman, but also metahumans in general (specifically Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg of the future Justice League). Furthermore, Lex's attempts to acquire power imply psychopathy, as they are extremely immoral and egregiously ruthless, with him having little care for the methods he uses, or their impact on others. Lex is even shown to have fits of psychotic frustration and rage when talking to a large group of people and not knowing what to say, due to his mind being otherwise occupied at that moment. Hence, when Lois Lane calls him \"psychotic\", Lex smugly dismisses that word as merely referring to \"any thought too big for little minds.\" Lex takes smug pride in his phenomenal intellect, usually sadistically thinking of others as his inferiors and pawns (managing to slyly reveal, for instance, that he is aware of Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent's alter egos, without them realizing it, and smugly sneering at the prospect of knowing something that Batman doesn't when the latter ambushes him in Belle Reve), proudly proclaiming how easy it had been for him to outsmart and manipulate even the experienced tactical and detective genius Batman, in addition to claiming that the exceptionally smart and insightful Lois Lane has only a \"little mind\" compared to his. Indeed, Lex's reliance on intellect and contingencies make him far more effective than almost all other supervillains. Hence, like, Amanda Waller, Lex is a manipulative and devious leverager, but an even more effective one than her, as Lex relies on more than just leverage, and never allows leverage-based power to become his weakness. Like Enchantress, Lex has a God complex, though he consistently relies far more on intellect and plans, never allowing arrogance to become his weakness. Like General Zod, Lex is a ruthless and indomitable winner who refuses to lose, though even more effective, due to not being limited by thinking boundaries or dogmatic tunnel vision. Like Joker, Lex is a sadistic psychopath with a penchant for unspeakable crimes, though far more covert and implicit, and hence far more successful at keeping those crimes from getting tied to him. Like Ares, Lex is an incredible deceiver who covertly manipulates his enemies and superbly hides in plain sight, though he has a greater number of contingencies planned. Finally, Lex is as intelligent as his archnemesis Superman is powerful, making Lex a worthy opponent for him, more than capable of gaining the upper hand against the mighty alien, despite his own lack of metahuman powers.\n\nLex is phenomenally brilliant in sciences and business, as well as tactics and strategy (to the point that he claims not to know how to lose), and is thereby practically always the smartest man in a room, but his God complex persona makes Lex very envious and bitter towards the godlike alien Superman, even going so far as openly describing the latter in infernal and diabolical terms, subtly comparing Superman to a werewolf (by referring to Kryptonite as a \"silver bullet\"), a \"winged demon\" (which he uses to justify his threat of ruthlessly burning Martha Kent alive), and finally, to the biblical Satan himself, who had originated not in \"Hell beneath [Lex]\", but had come \"from the sky\" (as a fallen archangel), inducing humanity to admire him.\n\nThis immense hatred of powerful individuals with popularity seemingly stems from the great amounts of hatred and resentment that Lex harbors for his late father, Alexander Luthor Sr., as the latter, while both powerful and popular, was extremely cruel and egregious behind closed doors, physically abusing his young and helpless son with both fists and \"abominations.\" Thus, Lex's experienced abuse, without any intervention from any \"man in the sky\", immensely traumatizes him, which in turn induces Lex to gain a militantly misotheistic view of God, believing that if God were omnipotent, then he logically could not be omnibenevolent and vice versa (the theological problem of evil), thereby solidifying his belief that power cannot be innocent (referring to the antithesis of that as the \"oldest lie in America\").\n\nSomewhat ironically, despite his misotheism, Lex has a penchant for constantly implementing allusions to major figures of both pagan and biblical theology, with him notably comparing himself to Prometheus, General Zod to Icarus, and Superman to Zeus, Horus, Apollo, Jehovah, and Satan. He even compares himself to the biblical God in one way, claiming to hate \"the sinner, not the sin\", and plays God by creating the monster Doomsday. When making these allusions, however, Lex tends to cast these theologies' supreme gods in a not very discreet negative light (expertly finding the right myths for that, as he did with Zeus' punishment of Prometheus), to the point that Wonder Woman was visibly enraged by Lex's description of Zeus and the Olympian Gods.\n\nIronically, while the egregious abuse would make Lex immensely despise his father, he would eventually come to share some of his father's traits as an adult, with Lex's exceptional intelligence, ruthless malevolence, and use of an affable façade all mirroring those of Luthor Sr., though it could be argued that Lex took all of these traits even further, as he would notably become more intelligent, skilled, malevolent, and powerful than his father had ever been. Hence, Lex projects his childhood trauma and theological resentment onto the godlike Superman, determined to prove to both himself and to humanity at large that the alien superhero, while being supremely powerful, is actually not supremely good, and is in fact an abominable fraud. Hence, while Lex claims to hate \"the sinner, not the sin\", he specifies that Superman's sin is existing. However, Lex notably does not have the same hatred towards General Zod, and actually seems to admire him, with Lex tearfully remarking that the latter had \"[flown] too close to the sun.\" This is most likely due the the fact that General Zod, unlike Superman, did not contradict Lex's worldview, due to Zod's godlike power being used for malevolent purposes.\n\nUltimately however, while Lex does somewhat admire General Zod, he proves himself to be considerably more evil than the latter, and thus an even greater enemy for Superman. Zod, after all, had initially tried to persuade Superman to side with him, and had genuinely cared for his allies (especially his closest and most trusted one, Faora), all while seeking to protect, save and resurrect what remained of his destroyed beloved world and his race, with only Zod's methods of doing this actually making him evil. Lex, by contrast, is purely evil and irredeemable, as he instantly resolves to become enemies with Superman (viewing the latter's very existence as a \"sin\"), was willing to become a supercriminal, committing unspeakable crimes against peace and humanity, all for the sheer purpose of destroying his archnemesis (and what the latter represents), of proving his cynical ideology and points (based in the theological problem of evil), and of reaffirming his deluded, megalomaniacal godly self-image to himself, while ultimately being egregiously egotistical, not caring about anyone other than himself, as even Doomsday (Lex's own Frankensteinian creation, whom Lex thought of as a surrogate son of sorts) and Mercy Graves (Lex's closest and most trusted ally) were ultimately disposable to him, being but means to an end. Lex even shows himself to be a psychopath on a level comparable to that of the Joker, since right before Lex is about to ruthlessly have Senator Finch killed, and later when he threatens to ruthlessly burn Martha Kent alive, Lex actually manages to find both situations funny, and cracks several sinister black humor pun jokes, with gleeful sadism. In addition, while all of Superman's other haters and detractors were guilt-ridden following his (apparent) death and mourned him, with even the exceptionally amoral Amanda Waller posthumously respecting him, while even the brutal and cynical Batman was inspired by him to better himself, Lex was as gleeful as ever, in utter defiance of himself being exposed as a supercriminal and incarcerated in Belle Reve supermax.\n\nAlso, despite his purely and egregiously malevolent egotistical nature as a deceitful supercriminal, Lex views himself as a heroic, enlightening, and altruistic humanist, even comparing himself to humanity's savior Prometheus, since Lex does indeed actually firmly believe in the importance of bettering humankind to its peak, and Lex claims that he wants to \"elevate the right people, the right human people\" in order to \"leave the planet in better shape for the next generation, to make the world and its children safer.\" Indeed, his LexCorp Industries mission statement is: \"Let's build a better tomorrow today\", while the specified one for Lex\/Os is: \"Help us build a more human system.\" Due to Batman epitomizing many of these humanist beliefs (having bettered himself both mentally and physically to his peak, without any superhuman assistance, making him capable of pulling off terrific feats without actually being superhuman), Lex somewhat admires him, despite Batman being his enemy and business rival, and Lex therefore selects the tremendously skilled vigilante to be his (discreetly manipulated) champion against Superman and the metahumans. Lex does not, however, view Batman as an equal, as he takes pride in his intellectual superiority, smugly proclaiming how easy it had been for him to deceive the vigilante into unknowingly becoming his pawn.\n\nAnother factor of Lex's resentment towards Superman was how, all his adult life, Lex was a megalomaniac and xenophobe, determined to view himself as a superior, godlike being amongst humans (due to his phenomenal intellect and achievements), and his ego was damaged when an actual godlike being induced Lex to existentially question his own deluded self-image. Hence, much like Enchantress, Lex has a superiority complex. Due to this, Lex, despite his ability to kill Superman himself (with the acquired Kryptonite), instead waits for the opportune moment to manipulate Superman and Batman into a fierce mortal duel, in order to first discredit the Man of Steel, so as to avoid Superman becoming a martyr, and to simultaneously humiliate Superman, by having a being of godlike power killed by an ordinary man (supported by Lex' many biblical allusions when gloatingly describing the heroes' planned mortal duel). Overall, while actually sane and only feigning insanity during his Belle Reve supermax imprisonment, Lex had in fact grown increasingly unhinged, due to the existential crisis that opposing Superman induced within him.\n\nLex is also incredibly brave, almost completely fearless, showing no signs of fear when confronted by an angry Superman, and even when unexpectedly ambushed in his Belle Reve supermax jail cell and at the mercy of a furious Batman with a branding ring (although Lex's sneer momentarily disappeared when Batman informed him about his transfer to Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane), with Lex going so far as smugly sneering at Batman's threats, gloating over Superman's death with gleeful sadism, and equally sadistically warning Batman about the imminent coming of a new, mysterious alien invader Darkseid, to whom Earth is now vulnerable to, due to Superman's death.\n\nLex does, however, have several prominent fears, the biggest of which, even more than that of losing his own life, being his fear of losing power and control, so yet another factor of Lex's resentment towards Superman was his outrage over the latter not deserving his godlike power, while feeling that instead, he is the one that deserves it, due to Lex being a self-made man (amassing his supergenius intellect, building up LexCorp Industries, and earning himself a phenomenal fortune in a superhuman business feat) from a difficult and traumatic upbringing. Indeed, due to this existential sense of entitlement, Lex epitomizes the Easterlin Paradox - being absolutely tormented, miserable, and full of rage, despite also being tremendously rich and successful Therefore, Lex values control above all else, so much so, that he places himself above Superman, and almost asks Superman to tear him apart, in their first confrontation. Hence, when confronted with his greatest fear, Lex shows himself to be a fatalist, as he used Doomsday as his last-ditch effort to destroy his archnemesis.\n\nWhile Lex's God complex does occasionally make him arrogant and overconfident, this weakness of his (unlike with supervillains like Ares, Enchantress, General Ludendorff, or Amanda Waller) is ultimately an insignificant one, as Lex's tremendous intellect and cold calculation allow him to very effectively compensate for this at almost all times, mastering almost any situation with his numerous tactical contingencies. Hence, when Senator Finch unexpectedly refuses to grant Lex an import license for the Indian Ocean Kryptonite, he promptly smuggles it in instead; when a guilt-ridden Kahina Ziri unexpectedly confesses her lies to Finch, Lex promptly has them both killed; when Batman and Superman unexpectedly stop their duel, team up and save Martha Kent, Lex promptly unleashes Doomsday upon them, killing Superman; when Lex's numerous unspeakable crimes get exposed and result in Belle Reve supermax imprisonment, Lex promptly makes himself unfit to stand trial by convincingly feigning insanity; and when Lex learns of his unexpected transfer to Arkham Asylum, he regains his confidence mere seconds later, most likely due to Lex having adapted a contingency plan for that as well. Hence overall, Lex Luthor is extremely unpredictable, as he often has numerous back-up plans to his back-up plans, accounting for numerous possible scenarios with efficient contingencies. Indeed, Lex's unparalleled ability to plan, strategize, restrategize, and break down his opponents grants him power that surpasses even that of Superman and metahumans, since Lex's ability to predict and gather information on his many opponents allows him to easily outstrategize any of them one-on-one, thereby making it almost impossible for them to succeed against Lex. As a result, Lex caught both Batman and Superman off-guard with the revelation of his endgame - Doomsday. Even Lex's personal assistant, confidant, and right-hand woman Mercy Graves, who knew him best, was ultimately not privy to all of Lex's master plans, and therefore was unable to correctly predict his future actions.\n\nMuch like his archenemy Superman, Lex has tremendous determination and strength of will, since he absolutely refuses to ever hunker down and give up, even when placed against seemingly insurmountable odds, with Lex mastering almost any situation with his numerous tactical contingencies, and even going so far as to claim that he doesn't know how to lose. Indeed, Lex even resolves to dominate in something as trivial as a bowling game with Ron Troupe. Hence, Lex managed to successfully transform his father's company, LexCorp Industries, from a petrochemical and heavy machinery dinosaur into a cutting-edge Fortune 500 technology giant (in a stupendous, what some call a superhuman, business feat), and being willing to use illegal operations to maintain the success of his oligarchical business empire. Later, despite the seemingly impossible task of bringing down the godlike Superman without having metahuman powers himself, Lex refuses to back down from it, and resolves to utilize his phenomenal intellect to devise complex and intricate plans to bring down his archenemy, along with back-up plans, and back-up plans to his back-up plans, for good measure, with Lex ultimately succeeding in defeating and killing Superman with his personal Frankensteinian creation Doomsday.\n\nLex carries out this malevolent plan with cold calculation and ruthless cruelty, being quick to murder anyone who gets in his way, such as the militantly oppositional Senator Finch, his guilt-ridden pawn Kahina Ziri, his unsuspecting pawns Jimmy Olsen and Cesar Santos, his no longer useful pawns Senator Barrows and Wallace Keefe (along with the 66 other attendees of Superman's hearing), Amajagh's Nairomian soldiers, and even his own loyal assistant Mercy Graves is likewise shown to be disposable to Lex, as she is likewise killed off along with them. Lex even goes so far as to sadistically threaten to burn the kidnapped Martha Kent alive unless Superman \"bows to [his] will\" by killing Batman. This meticulous and brilliant plan behind Lex's ultimatum was to expose the theological problem of evil in Superman regardless of the fight's outcome - if Superman were to win and kill Batman (to save his mother's life) he would prove to be supremely powerful yet not supremely good, and if Superman were to lose (due to holding back and his weakness to Kryptonite) to Batman and die, he would prove to be supremely good yet not supremely powerful.\n\nIn the meantime, Lex continues to garner as much power as he can get his hands on, being quick to order the Fortress of Solitude to teach him all about the knowledge from 100,000 alien worlds, thereby expanding his already brilliant mind to supergenius level, finally becoming even more godlike in his own eyes. Despite the failure of his initial grand plan, Lex's far more grand and extreme contingency plan of unleashing Doomsday succeeds, with Superman seemingly being killed by the bloodthirsty monster. Indeed, Lex appears to be so satisfied with his success (as he claims not to know how to lose), that he cares little about being imprisoned for his numerous unspeakable crimes shortly thereafter, and gleefully awaits the imminent arrival of Darkseid.\n\nLex also has a somewhat dry, black, and sadistic sense of humor (similar to that of the Joker and General Ludendorff), and love for both witty puns and visual metaphors, shown when Lex mockingly imitated a Kentucky accent when speaking with Senator Finch; when Lex told the wheelchair-bound Wallace Keefe that he wanted to help the latter \"stand\" for something; when Lex claims that the shortest road to Superman is \"Lois lane\"; when Lex mentions \"civilizations of the wane, manners out the window\" to Batman (subtly revealing that he knows of Bruce Wayne being the Dark Knight's alter ego); when Lex had a jar of urine placed upon Senator Finch's desk, labelled \"Granny's Peach Tea\" (illustrating an epithet that she herself had used against him not along ago) before coldly murdering her with a hidden bomb; and when Lex described the upcoming battles between Superman and Batman, and later Superman and Doomsday with dramatic and sadistic glee, mockingly incorporating antique and theological metaphors (such as describing the first battle as the \"greatest gladiator match in the history of the world\"). In addition, Lex seems to be well-versed in American pop-culture, making quite a few references from it as well, notably \"The Midnight Ride\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Lolita\" and the \"Wizard of Oz.\" Following his incarceration in Belle Reve and the shaving of his head, Lex retained his sadism, but also paired it with a far more confident, cold and calculating attitude than before, in contrast to his previous darkly humorous persona.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lex_Luthor"}}

However, Lois was able to expose Luthor's numerous crimes, getting him imprisoned.","Lois followed him to a recently melted cavern entrance that burrowed deep within the ice until it led directly to the epicenter of the artifact which was revealed to be an ancient alien spacecraft. Lois continued to follow Joe and attempted to take a photo, but accidentally activated the automated sensors of a Sentry Robot on the ship, which attacked her. Lois was rescued by Joe, who crushed the robot with his bear hands, much to Lois' astonishment. The man (whose real name was not actually \"Joe\", as Lois realized) saw that she was bleeding exponentially, and cauterizes the wound with his heat vision, the brief yet intense pain of which causes her to pass out.","Lois interviewed Pete Ross which led her directly to Martha Kent, where she learned the name of her rescuer was Clark Kent. Lois encountered Clark in the cemetery at the grave of his father Jonathan Kent, Clark told her his story and why he didn't want it to be told to the world, in fear of being rejected for being an alien with godlike superpowers. Lois came to respect and admire Clark for what he's doing and, full of compassion for him, selflessly decided to drop the story. Returning to the Daily Planet, Lois was reprimanded harshly by Perry who was furious at her for leaking the story to Woodburn, Lois accepted her punishment of two week lay-off with no pay. Perry admired her for choosing to drop the story as it would cause mass panic to the public if the world learned of the existence of a being like this but knew it was uncharacteristic of her and suspecting her leads did take her to the source.","Lois and Perry were summoned by Steve Lombard who told them to watch a mysterious transmission that was emitting from every form of telecommunication with a message stating \"You are not alone\". General Zod then appeared on the screen, identifying himself, and promptly requesting that his fellow alien \"Kal-El\" turn himself over to him in twenty-four hours, or that the planet would suffer consequences of apocalyptic proportions otherwise. Lois realized that Zod was referring to Clark, and saw out of the window that General Zod's ship was slowly descending upon Metropolis. As newscasters and journalists all around the world began to panic, Glen Woodburn swiftly betrayed Lois by declaring that she knew who the alien Kal-El was, to which Lois tried to flee but was apprehended by the FBI. Kal-El, now dressed in a colorful red and blue Kryptonian attire, appeared before the military at a Northcom base, surrendering himself to be handed over to General Zod, but under one condition - that he could speak with Lois Lane first, who would be set free after his delivery to the other Kryptonians.","Inside the craft, Faora placed a Kryptonian helmet on Lois to allow her to breath aboard Black Zero, Zod's Mothership. Clark also slipped Lois the command key to keep safe. Once aboard the ship Zod greeted them, unfortunately Clark's body struggled to adjust to the natural Kryptonian environment and he began to weaken and cough up blood. Lois showed great concern for Clark, pleading that they help him.","Lois's pod was fired upon by Car-Vex, causing damage upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. As fire appeared around the pod encasing her, Lois caught a glimpse of Clark soaring down after her, and he ripped open the pod, managing to grab and wrap his indestructible cape around her just in time, successfully shielding Lois from the blast of the explosion from the pod. He then lowered her gently down into a cornfield. Lois apologized to Clark, as she told him that they probed her mind to find information about him. He told her they did the same to him, so she shouldn't worry. Clark then realized that his mother was in mortal danger, and quickly launched up into the sky, flying at top speed towards the Kent Farm. Lois saw an approaching police car and commandeered the car to head to the Kent Farm as well, as she still intended to relay Jor-El plan to Clark.","Superman emerged from the rubble of the Kryptonian Scout Ship and saw Lois falling in mid air so he took flight and caught her just as the portal of the Phantom Zone began pulling the Kryptonians and their ships into the Zone. Clark, with all of his might, pushed through the vortex and saved Lois, flying her down to safety. In the mist of the Metropolis ruins, she and Clark began to kiss passionately but were cut short by the reappearance of Zod who was extremely outraged at Kal-El for choosing to protect humanity rather than the survival of his own Kryptonian race. Superman engaged in a ferocious battle against General Zod in Metropolis and space, as Lois watched the mighty aliens' battle from a safe distance.","In the following week, Lois was at her desk in the Daily Planet, busy writing a story regarding the recent unprecedented events that had transpired, when Steve Lombard asked her out on a date, offering her tickets to a basketball game. Lois, uninterested, suggested he try his luck with the interns. Perry then introduced a new reporter to her, Clark Kent who was now wearing a pair of glasses to help hide his identity. Lois, the only one to instantly recognize him as Superman, warmly welcomed Clark to \"the planet\" (an inside pun joke that only the two of them understood).","One day, Lois and Clark swiftly exist the Daily Planet newsroom, as Lois heads off to expose the corrupt CEO Mark Hanford (who had been illegally profiting from the sale of Kryptonian weapons on the black market), while Clark heads off to help with floods in Bangladesh as Superman, warning Lois to be safe in his absence.","In search of a story, Lois travels to war-torn Nairomi, seeking an interview with the warlord Amajagh, who lead one faction in the Nairomian Civil War. Lois was accompanied by photographer Jimmy Olsen, who is revealed to be working for the CIA. Jimmy had a tracking device hidden in his camera, revealed by Amajagh's bodyguard Anatoli Knyazev. Jimmy states that Lois knew nothing of the device or his identity, before Knyazev shoots him. Lois is then taken as a hostage by Amajagh who threatens to kill her. However, Superman then arrives and saves Lois from the warlord. Lois recovers a bullet from the scene, and after researching discovers it is not made by any known manufacturer.","Lois is sitting in the bathtub when suddenly Clark Kent comes to her apartment. Clark said to her that he wanted to surprise her by cooking up something. When the subject shifts to the controversy surrounding his actions in Nairomi, Clark makes it clear that he didn't kill anyone and wasn't concerned also adding that Lois can also be killed. Hearing this, Lois asked him if he can still love her then Clark enters the bathtub and starting to kiss her and he takes his glasses off and his shirt off.","Lois, in order to effectively research the mysterious bullet that she recovered from Nairomi, seeks out the help of S.T.A.R. Labs weapons expert and ballistics specialist Jenet Klyburn. Upon examination, Jenet informs Lois that the bullet was innovative and composed of an unknown metal.","Lois takes the mysterious bullet to Secretary of Defense Swanwick. Reluctantly, he gives in to her requests to know who makes the bullet. He reveals to her they are a special prototype round made by LexCorp Industries.","When Lex Luthor's bomb (concealed in Wallace Keefe's wheelchair) suddenly ends the hearing, Lois is shocked and devastated, but stays, seeing how Superman attempts to help, carrying an injured woman to safety. He begins to look around him and sees dozens of corpses and injured civilians, he begins swelling with guilt, and throws a glance of sorrow at Lois, before launching off into the air.","That evening, Superman flew back to his and Lois' apartment and spoke to her on the balcony. While Lois assured him that he was not to blame and was about to tell him of Lex Luthor's involvement, Superman insisted that he hadn't been able to prevent the bombing because he hadn't been looking for a potential bomb in the first place. Now, mortified at how his actions had so far consistently lead to horrible consequences, Clark claims that the whole idea of \"Superman\" had never even been real in the first place, with it only ever being \"the dream of a farmer from Kansas.\" Lois insisted that this \"dream\" is all that most people have to give them hope, and she pointed to his House of El glyph, stating that it still means something. However, Clark sadly replies that while it did on Krypton, that world no longer exists, and he then promptly flies off, into self-imposed exile.","Determined to find evidence against Superman's alleged involvement in the Capitol bombing, Lois visits the late Wallace Keefe's apartment. While there, most of what she finds seems to indicate that Keefe was behind the bombing, however at the last moment, Lois discovers that Keefe had just bought groceries, indicating that he was unaware that he was going to die.","Shortly thereafter, Lois is kidnapped by his men in order to draw Superman to him. He pushers her off the edge of his buildings helipad, and Lex's plan works as she is rescued by Superman. After flying Lois to safety, he confronts Lex who shows Superman photos of his mother in captivity and uses the threat of her life in order to get him to kill Batman.","As Superman flies to the Fortress of Solitude to stop Lex, and Batman flies off to rescue Martha Kent, Lois grabs the Kryptonite spear and hurls it into a pool of water, so as to keep the dangerous weapon (and exploitable weakness against Superman) out of others' hands.","A visibly saddened Batman finds Superman's body, enveloping Clark in his own cape, and giving the fallen hero's body to Wonder Woman, who gently places it on the ground, seconds before the arrival of Lois, to whom she gives a silent glance of empathy. Realizing what Clark had done, Lois was devastated, proceeding to cradle and weep over her fallen beloved, as Batman and Wonder Woman stand next to her in respectful lamenting silence.","Right before Clark's funeral, Martha gives Lois an envelope with an engagement ring which was to be given to her during Clark's proposal. Heartbroken, Lois wears the engagement ring at the funeral, and, while Bruce and Diana are busy talking close by, she drops a handful of dirt onto Clark's casket."],"name":"Lois Lane","description":"Lois is a resolute, tough and persistent reporter, who always seeks the big scoop and story.

Jonathan died wanting to make sure Clark's secret weren't shown to anyone. Martha was devastated, and Jonathan was buried in Smallville cemetery alongside his brother Harry. Shortly after, Clark left Smallville following his adopted father\u2019s wishes and searched to find the purpose he was sent to Earth.","Years later, Lois Lane of the Daily Planet turned up at Martha\u2019s farm with questions about Clark. Martha was unenthusiastic to reply to her queries about him, and promptly asked her to leave. Not long afterwards, Clark returned home to his mother. He revealed to Martha that he discovered the answers to the questions he was searching for and that he learnt what his birth name is and what his true calling in life was, to provide the world with hope. Martha then told Clark about Lois inquiring about him.","After General Zod, the former military leader and war criminal of Krypton, broadcasted a communication across the planet looking for Clark, Clark gave himself up to spare Earth. General Zod and his forces arrived on her farm looking for Clark and the Growth Codex. Faora picked a non-cooperative Martha up, and the latter instinctively looked towards her barn. Faora promptly hurled Martha to the ground, and leaped into the the barn, finding Clark's infant starship. A desperate General Zod further threatened Martha, until Clark suddenly flew in and tackled him off of Martha, drawing the attention of his forces to downtown Smallville. After Zod's forces left to regroup, Clark returned to the farm to check on Martha, who had survived her ordeal unscathed. They were then approached by Lois Lane, who had a plan of defeating the Kryptonians.","After General Zod\u2019s death and defeat Clark returned to Smallville to visit Martha. He declared to her his intentions to move to Metropolis and start a career as a reporter at the Daily Planet.","Martha is called by Clark when the latter is agitated by seeing so many on the news discussing him (\"The Superman Question\") as a figure of controversy.

A bit confused, Martha says that this was so because her late husband had felt that he was \"already there\", and he thus had no need to travel. Clark sighs, saying that he wished things were simple. Martha, however, gently disagrees, claiming that \"nothing was ever simple.\"","While the rest of the world is debating whether Superman has been a positive or negative addition to planet Earth, Clark returns home to Smallville to visit Martha. There, she advises him that either way he shouldn't worry what others think of him.","After Lex Luthor discovers Superman's identity, Martha is kidnapped by his men (lead by Knyazev), and stored in a warehouse near the port in Gotham.

In addition, he had a secretary named Etta Candy. He helped thwart the plans of General Ludendorff, Dr. Poison, and Ares himself, sacrificing his life in the process.","Steve Trevor was serving as a UK Army Air Service Captain in World War I. Steve was on a mission in an Ottoman Empire base. There, he managed to steal a notebook containing the gaseous toxicology research of Doctor Poison. The notebook details a new deadlier form of mustard gas which could annihilate the Allied forces, and win the war for the German Empire. Steve stole a plane from the base to escape with the notebook, however he was shot down in open sea. He crash-landed near the island of Themyscira. He was saved from drowning by the Amazon princess Diana. As he came to, she asked Steve if he was a man, due to Diana never having come across a male before in her life. Though somewhat confused, Steve affirmed that he was, rhetorically asking if he looked like one. Steve aided Diana and the Amazons defending the beach against a German invasion force where he took down a German soldier and used his rifle to shoot at least two other German soldiers.","When they arrived in London, Steve accompanied Diana through the streets while explaining some things to her such as why people hold hands and then along with his secretary Etta Candy, they went to get Diana new clothes. Steve delivered the notebook to his superiors at high command but they refused to act which seemed to anger Diana. Steve and Diana were leaving where he told her how they were going anyway and rapped the lasso of truth around his wrist to prove to Diana that he was, without doubt, telling the truth.","Steve infiltrated a gathering of Germans during a Gala, but was unable to complete his goal due to Diana. He and his team were then separated from Diana while she fought Ares to destroy the gas. Steve told Diana he loved her and give her his watch. He then boarded the plane storing the gas, fought, defeated two German soldiers and then flew the plane as high as he could. Steve drew his pistol and shot the gas igniting it and destroying the plane preventing the distribution of the gas, resulting in his own death.","Nearly a century after Steve's death the photograph taken in Belgium is eventually discovered by Lex Luthor, who compiles it into his footage of all the other metahumans. The photo is eventually returned to Diana by Bruce Wayne."],"name":"Steve Trevor","description":"Steve Trevor, as a soldier, is remarkably courageous, bold, dedicated, and determined, while also an exceptionally cunning, improvisational, and capable spy. While originally somewhat cynical and narrow-minded, Steve's background as a spy makes him tactful (hence he rarely voices his skepticism of Diana's story of Ares, or her Amazonian beliefs, and doesn't hold Charlie's PTSD or Chief's anti-colonial bitterness against them), while also capable of improvising and spinning convincing lies in tough situations. Steve's dedication is shown by his desire to end World War I, and to contribute to that he usually follows protocol, but disobeys orders when disagreeing with them, specifically when British Intelligence superiors' orders prohibit him from taking active initiative. This is due to Steve following in the footsteps of his father, who believed in the importance of acting when one wanted to make a difference. While initially cynical, and disbelieving Diana's story (despite both Sameer and Chief coming to believe it), seeing Wonder Woman's compassion and unbreakable spirit in action renews Steve's hope, boosting his morale and energizing him to cross over to the German trench after her, freeing a Belgian village from cruel occupation, and no longer hesitating against seemingly insurmountable odds. As an espionage expert, Steve also has immense willpower, enough to even resist the Lasso of Truth for several seconds.\n\nSteve displays a softer side after meeting and gradually falling in love with Wonder Woman, explaining to her the customs of humanity, being understanding of her naive social blunders, genuinely admitting his own lack of understanding of some human customs (such as marriage and family life), and eventually starting to tactfully woo her. He soon comes to understand Diana's true potential, and right before he selflessly sacrifices himself (to thwart Ares' plan and finally end the World War I for good), he passionately expresses his unwavering belief in Diana's ability to save the world, as well as his unwavering love for her. Indeed, just as much as Diana had several days prior inspired him, so did Steve's final moments inspire her, with Diana clinging to their mutual love in order to bypass her ambivalence and violent tendencies, and to defeat Ares for good. Diana's love and respect for Steve's final sacrifice were so immense, that even 100 years later, she would be rendered tearful by the memory of it, and Superman's own actions and sacrifice inspired Diana mainly because she saw a lot of Steve Trevor in him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steve_Trevor"}}

However, despite his incredible powers, Flash initially remains insecure and unsure of himself, since all of his League teammates seemed prepared to to do battle against Steppenwolf's army, while Flash, as he modestly admits, has never been in an actual battle before, since up until then, he would just ambush villains like Captain Boomerang and run away.\n\nDespite his tragic childhood, Barry is quite laid-back, witty, bubbly, somewhat childish and humorous, in stark contrast to the very calm, mature, dark and serious Batman. Regardless of these differences though, Flash idolizes Batman, promptly expressing a desire to keep the batarang that he caught at superspeed, while demonstrating his powers. Flash seems to idolize and admire Superman just as much, however, as the Man of Steel's heroic death is what inspired Barry to also more openly use his own metahuman powers and come out into the light as the scarlet speedster superhero Flash.

He also seemed to value his friends and allies, since Zod was dismayed when Jor-El ended their long friendship, and was guilt-ridden about murdering his former friend (to the point that doing so would later haunt Zod for many years). While often calm and collected, Zod was capable of fearsome fits of rage, notably against High Eminence Lor-Em, Jor-El and Superman.\n\nDespite his occasionally angry tone and demeanor however, General Zod was in fact exceptionally intelligent, with Superman, upon meeting him, concluding from Zod's facial expression that the latter was \"equally intelligent\" to Jor-El, Krypton's foremost scientist. Zod's intellect mainly extends to his leadership, intimidation, tactical, and other military skills, though the thinking boundaries programmed into General Zod's engineered DNA occasionally make him imperfect in utilizing these skills. While Zod wasn't quite as debilitated by these boundaries as High Eminence Lor-Em or Ro-Zar (since unlike them, Zod was able to actually see how ineffective the dogmatic Kryptonian Law Council was), he, like them, also had a poor grasp at free will, was often prone to dogmatic tunnel vision, and was utterly unable to live out any lifestyle other than the one that he was born for. Hence, while this did allow Zod to both effectively lead the Sword of Rao and to come up with a strategy to restore Krypton, it also made him unable to diplomatically coexist with humanity (like Superman could), to account for Superman caring about them, or to account for Superman's innovative combat strategy (of effectively using all of the powers that Zod had not yet gained, as well as Zod's weaknesses, against him, in their first fight). Indeed, this is what allowed the free willed Superman to defeat Zod in their first fight (despite being a far less skilled combatant), and to undermine Zod's apocalyptic World Engine strategy.\n\nGeneral Zod was also an incredibly bold and determined individual, as even when his Kryptonian Civil War coup failed, leaving him helpless and at the mercy of High Eminence Lor-Em, Zod refused to be intimidated, and went so far as to mock the former and spit at the High Eminence's feet in defiance, and only silently gritted his teeth while being painfully frozen into a cryocapsule (while almost all of his other loyalists bellowed and cringed). Upon his unexpected release from the Phantom Zone, Zod, unlike Faora, refused to fall into despair, and tirelessly lead his followers on a 33-year-long search for a planet suitable for terraforming, never seeming to lose hope, and still inducing fierce and unwavering loyalty from his Sword of Rao followers. Hence, due to his great willpower and determination, General Zod, unlike Superman, never experienced the weakness of mental power suppression, and was at his full strength potential upon absorbing a yellow sun's radiation. It was also through his sheer willpower that Zod eventually overcame his temporary weakness of overloaded senses within Earth's atmosphere, and swiftly mastered the power of flight.\n\nEven Lex Luthor seemed to somewhat admire General Zod, with him sadly remarking that the latter had \"[flown] too close to the sun\" while observing Zod's corpse. This is most likely due the the fact that General Zod, due to his godlike power being used for malevolent purposes, perfectly represented Lex's worldview.\n\nAfter his plans were thwarted and his loyalists re-imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, Zod, having failed at what he had considered to be the sole purpose of his life, became more brutal and furious than ever in his devastation, and megalomaniacally threatened to personally wipe out the entire human race of Earth in revenge. Since Zod had nothing left to lose, he engaged Superman in a ferocious final duel, refusing to stop unleashing his fury upon humanity, thus inevitably forcing a very reluctant Superman to kill him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/General_Zod"}}

At the United States Capitol in Washington D.C., Senator Finch led the committee on the subject of Superman. General Elkins presented a CGI simulation of a male Kryptonian attacking a city such as Metropolis, fighting against F-35s. Senator Stearns defended Superman's intentions on Earth, due to the latter having saved the planet from his own invading people, and, more recently, saved hundreds of lives from a forest wildfire in Stearns' state. After the group began heatedly debating, Finch promptly calmed things down, stating that before an ultimate decision regarding Superman was made, the issue of his existence had to be approached objectively, and she therefore advocated for the creation of a committee to study and learn more about Superman, to which the majority of those present agreed. As everybody left, Finch asked General Elkins for everything he had on Superman.","Finch hears evidence from Kahina Ziri, about Superman saving the life of Lois Lane in war torn Nairomi, Africa.

In order to forge such a \"silver bullet\", Lex requests Finch to grant him an import license for the large piece of Kryptonite lying in the Indian Ocean (at the wreckage of General Zod's World Engine). Finch leaves, considering the request, while Barrows stays, intent to continue a discussion with Lex.","Several days later, Finch is escorted into Lex's study by his right-hand assistant Mercy Graves. While Lex is initially exited to see her, Finch promptly tells him that she's decided not to grant him the import license. Lex is visibly enraged, beginning to nervously tap his fingers, but Finch physically stops him, letting Lex know that she sees right through his altruistic façade, telling him that he can \"Take a bucket of piss and call it Granny's peach tea, take a weapon of assassination and call it deterrence\", but that she wouldn't \"drink it.\" Lex gives her a sinister grin, and states that he has considered turning an old picture of his father's (depicting a battle between Heaven's angels and Hell's demons) upside down, and enigmatically telling her that \"the Red Capes are coming.\" Finch then promptly departs.","Finally, Senator Finch is interviewed on the matter, with her interviewer wondering aloud if it is really surprising that Superman, as the most powerful man in the world, is viewed as a figure of controversy. He proceeds to ask her if, as a US Senator, Finch would be personally comfortable with saying to a grieving parent, that Superman could have saved his\/her child, but that on principle, the US government had not wanted him to act. Senator Finch responds by admitting that Superman's engagement in state-level interventions (notably recently in Nairomi) should indeed give them all pause. However, she proceeds by saying that the problem is not Superman's actions, but rather, that he should not be carrying them out unilaterally. This makes her interviewer conclude by saying that the overall question is in fact, \u201Cmust there be a Superman?\u201D; to which she simply replies that \u201CThere is\u201D. Clark himself sees this interview on television, and is visibly dismayed.","Despite media speculation to the contrary, Superman arrives to speak and answer at Finch's committee.

She and her teammates ultimately succeed in their mission to save the world from Enchantress and Incubus (in exchange for 10 years off of their prison sentences), but Harley is quick to leave the Squad and rejoin her boyfriend Joker when he successfully frees her from prison.","Following her graduation, Harleen's theatrical thesis made a huge success that it led to her transfer into the job as a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum. When the Joker was imprisoned there by the masked vigilante Batman, she took a particular interest in him, regularly visiting and speaking with him. Harleen was gradually psychologically sabotaged and manipulated by the psychopath, eventually falling in love with him, and the Joker got her to do him a favor, which was giving him a machine gun. Shortly thereafter, Joker's goons broke into the asylum and successfully broke their boss out. Before leaving however, Joker sadistically subjected Harleen to shock therapy, but she took the pain.","From that point on, the Joker dubbed her \"Harley Quinn\" (giving her a red-and-black Harlequin costume), and the duo of psychopathic lovers would go on a number of crime sprees in Gotham City together, which would often result in the duo coming into conflict with Batman, becoming (as Amanda Waller would later claim) the king and queen of the Gotham city underworld.","The Joker, with Harley's help, managed to kill Batman's partner, Robin.

Upon her visit to Belle Reve to examine the future team, she visits Harley outside her cage while the latter is meditating. Harley feels hypnotized by the government agents' presence and asks if she is the Devil, to which Waller proclaimed that she is maybe so.","While mid-flight en route to their destination, Harley looks at a new text from the Joker saying that he's coming to get her. Deadshot peers over to see, so she signals him to be quiet about it and he decides to comply. After their helicopter is shot down, the squad is forced to travel the rest of the way on foot, splitting up with Squad B, who are able to land their helicopter safely. After witnessing, Slipknot's explosive get activated, Harley and Deadshot bond and plot with the others against Flag to turn the odds in their favor the first chance they get.","Soon after, the group encounters creatures in the Enchantress' employment known as the Eyes of the Adversary. When Flag approaches them, the creatures become hostile and attack. The squad is initially overwhelmed as the Eyes capture Flag, much to Harley's delight. Deadshot, however, reminds her what Waller had said about the Squad members being as good as dead if the colonel is injured or killed, so she changes her mind and aids Flag with getting the monsters off of him. She continued to beat up the already-dead Eyes, claiming to have seen it flinching, but Deadshot stops her and they all move on to the task at hand. Flag contacts Waller when all contact with Squad B fails, and learns the other squadron was engaged with another group of Eyes at the same time, but have all been taken prisoner and brought to the Enchantress herself.","The Squad makes their way up the building, resulting in Harley becoming winded. As she stops to catch her breath, the familiarity of the environment causes her to flashback to the night at Ace Chemicals when the Joker had her bleach her skin for him. As Harley snaps out of her flashback, she quickly points her gun at Deadshot. Still recovering from her flashback, she asks Deadshot if he had ever been in love. After Deadshot tells her that something like love would keep him from performing his job, Harley only smiles and calls him \"another textbook sociopath.\"","Harley climbs into the helicopter and embraces the Joker. However, their reunion is short lived as their helicopter is hit with a missile. As she and Joker both attempt to make their escape, a sudden explosion throws Harley out of the helicopter. Harley lands on the rooftop below and watches the helicopter, with Joker still in it, crash into a nearby building.","In the bar, Harley convinces Killer Croc to have a drink with the rest of the Squad. Harley then proceeds to pour drinks for the rest of the Squad. She joins the rest of the Squad in cheers after she makes her own drink, complete with an overabundance of drink umbrellas. Deadshot states his regret over their situation, causing El Diablo to lash out at him and eventually break down, revealing his tragic past. Angry at Diablo's guilt, Harley yells at him to own up to his mistakes and to accept that a normal life isn't possible for them, causing Boomerang to call her out on her vexing behavior. Harley then goes on to state that they're all ugly on the inside, just like her, except for Croc, who's also ugly on the outside. When Croc claims he is beautiful, Harley nods in agreement to him owning his physical attributes.","The Squad makes their way to the subway station and begins to prepare for the coming battle. Flag explains their plan: to lure Incubus over a charge and destroy him. Harley, along with Flag, Deadshot, and Captain Boomerang have one last conversation before they head into the subway.","As the Squad approaches Enchantress, she unleashes the full power of her weapon, disorientating the Harley and the other Squad members. Enchantress then reverts to her feral form and attacks the Squad, during which, Harley is smacked aside. Enchantress disappears, much to the Squad's displeasure, to only reappear shortly after, wielding dual blades. The Squad continues to fight Enchantress, to where the witch nearly has Harley cornered, only for Harley to avoid the attack at the last moment. Harley eventually lands a hit on Enchantress' head, which seemed to only make the witch more irritated.

Fortunately, June survives this and reunites with Flag, something Harley is happy to see. As the rest of the Squad readies to re-enter the world, Harley herself is ready to hot wire a car, Amanda Waller appears and reactivates their explosives. Harley is at first appalled since Waller didn't thank them for saving the world. However, once Waller does thank them, Harley cheerfully tells her she's welcome. When Waller then allows them to make specialized requests, Harley asks for an expresso machine."],"name":"Harley Quinn","description":"Harleen Frances Quinzel was once a highly intelligent, calm and compassionate young lady who worked at Arkham Asylum, before the Joker transformed her both mentally and physically into \"Harley Quinn\". Through the shock therapy and the Joker's manipulation, her mind and emotions were twisted and she was made into a homicidal, sadistic, child-like psychopath, who would use sexuality and her playful personality to achieve her goals or to entertain herself, usually harming others in the process. As of current time, she follows the Joker in whatever he demands of her, blindly smitten with the ruthless psychopath, affectionately referring to him as \"puddin'\".\n\nHarley carries almost an innocent persona, wide-eyed and bright, finding humor in otherwise dark situations, much like Joker himself. After attacking Belle Reve guards and seriously injuring a couple before finally being restrained, she maniacally began giggling to herself in a sinister way, happy and pleased with how funny she found it, showing how fractured her psyche had become.\n\nHowever, despite her sociopathy, Harley is still highly intelligent, even showing traces of her psychologist expertise, as Harley was able to make swift breakdowns of the psychological profiles of her teammates, knowing exactly what to say in order to get under their skin (proudly referring to herself as \"vexing\"), though Deadshot calls her out on this. Her intellect also extends itself to tactical skills, as Harley notably assisted the Joker in the murder of Robin, suggested to Deadshot and Captain Boomerang a feasible escape option from Suicide Squad, and even swiftly improvised a plan to weaken and take down the extremely powerful Enchantress, which proved successful.\n\nHarley is also quite tough and pathologically fearless (another trait she shares with her boyfriend), fighting alongside Suicide Squad and having fun doing so. With the team, she is shown to get along well with them, once she got to know them a bit better, with Harley acting as a bar tender at a derelict bar. She even seemed horrified before El Diablo's death, imploring Rick Flag not to blow him up (while defeating Incubus).\n\nShe has a very dim view on a regular life, stating \"normal is a setting on the washer\" to El Diablo, who lost his family because of his powers; however, Harley does have the dream of having a family with the Joker, as Enchantress' implanted vision revealed.\n\nAlthough often painted as a victim of psychological abuse, the Joker himself claims very little credit for Harley's condition. Indeed, according to the Clown Prince of Crime, Harley was always mad deep down (simply better at controlling her insanity then most), and that he himself had merely made all her madness rise to the surface. It should be noted, however, that Joker's insanity occasionally occasionally induces him to make conclusions that only make sense to him, hence this might not necessarily be the case.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/dcextendeduniverse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Harley_Quinn"}}
