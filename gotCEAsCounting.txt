Unlike regular lordships or the kings of the mainland, in past centuries the King of the Iron Islands was not a hereditary monarchy, but an elective kingship: all the lords and ship captains of the Iron Islands would gather at an assembly known as a Kingsmoot to hold an election for a new king from among their own numbers.","Euron Greyjoy, Balon Greyjoy's younger brother, shows up one stormy night, after Balon and Yara discuss their failed conquest of the North, and confronts Balon as he crosses one of the rope bridges that connects Pyke's three towers. With Euron having been away from the Iron Islands for many years, Balon is noticeably displeased to see his brother again. Tensions grow between the two brothers, with Euron demanding that Balon let him pass so that he may become the next King of the Iron Islands, and Balon refusing. Balon comes at Euron with a knife, slicing his cheek, though Euron grapples Balon and throws him off the rope bridge where the standoff occurs.","Any ironborn may nominate himself, not necessarily royalty, even from a House which is regarded poorly in the eyes of the other ironborn (though the chances of a member of one of the weaker and less distinguished Houses tend to be lower). Women are not officially forbidden from participating in the Kingsmoot, but the ironborn are not likely to choose a woman to rule them. The TV series stated that no woman has ever ruled over the ironborn: this hasn't been outright confirmed in the novels but seems strongly implied, given that no female ruler was ever mentioned (even over the vassal Houses on the isles).","Aeron seeks solace at the sea. He sends away those who follow him, wishing no company but his god. He enters the seas and prays. Then he hears a voice \"Aeron, my good and faithful servant, you must tell the Ironborn that the Crow\u2019s Eye is no true king, that the Seastone Chair by rights belongs to\u2026 to\u2026 to\u2026\". Aeron knows it is neither Victarion nor Asha. He has an idea: Victarion will wed Asha, and they will rule together. He makes it back to the shore, confident that he can bring Euron down, not by force but by the power of his faith. It is then that some of Euron's mutes grab and knock him unconscious. Aeron is held captive and tortured By Euron, not only to prevent him from acting against his brother: Euron says he keeps Aeron alive because he needs his blood, but does not reveal for what purpose.","In their analysis of the two candidates, the CNN anchors weighed in that it was \"A two-person race between Balon's daughter Yara who's ruthless, and his estranged brother Euron who is, frankly, murderous.\" Describing the two candidates' chances in the Kingsmoot, they accurately surmised: \"Now, the Iron Islands have never had a female leader before, so it's unclear whether or not they'd be willing to embrace her. But on the other hand, Euron is something of a carpetbagger, they haven't seen him in years.\" The sketch is available for free online."],"name":"Kingsmoot","description":"In the Iron Islands, it is believed that every ship captain is essentially a king of his boat on the open sea. If a captain is foolish or incompetent, he gets his men killed, so in ancient times the ironborn came to accept that a captain could not hold his position without the consent of his crew - and by extension, that the petty kings of each of the islands (who were \"captains\" in a sense, and often admirals of their fleets). These grew into \"kingsmoot\" elections, where all the lords and ship captains have a vote on who should be their next king, not simply letting the previous king's son inherit rule.\n\nAmong the ironborn, legend says that during the Dawn Age, after the Grey King slew the sea dragon Nagga he unified the isles, but eventually died. The Grey King's hundred sons then fought for rule until only sixteen were left, but found that their powers were too evenly matched to continue, so they agreed to arbitrate the matter by holding a vote on who should succeed as king. Given that the Grey King was a legendary figure who is said to have warred with gods and monsters, some doubt that he or his sons ever existed. But the fact remains that due to their harsh life at sea, the ironborn developed a strong tradition that their kings must achieve their office through support of most of their subordinates, by means of voting in open elections.\n\nAfter King Harren the Black and his sons were killed in the War of Conquest, Aegon the Conqueror had the ironborn select a new House to rule the Iron Islands (under the overall rule of the Targaryens), according to their custom. The ironborn chose Vickon Greyjoy as Lord of the Iron Islands, and House Greyjoy continued to rule over the ironborn by hereditary right for the next three centuries.\n\nThe Greyjoys continued to have symbolic Kingsmoots ever since, but in truth it was little more than empty ceremony. After the Conquest, the Greyjoys functionally practiced the same rule-through-inheritance laws as the rest of Westeros, and these \"Kingsmoots\" always picked the blood heir of the last leader - nor did they rule as \"kings\" but a regional Lord Paramount under the Targaryen kings.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Kingsmoot"}}

They drop their family name when they join the order. They are assigned to serve at castles and holdfasts throughout the Seven Kingdoms and are bound by their vows to serve whoever holds the castle in which they reside, regardless of changes in lordship. It is not considered a breach of their vows if a maester advises the current lord of their castle in military matters to defeat their enemies, but if their lord is defeated by his enemies and possession of the castle officially changes hands, the maester is expected to serve his new lord.\n\nSimilar to the Night's Watch, the Order of Maesters is an egalitarian institution whose members must ignore their past family and political ties, give up their right to inheritance, and take an oath of celibacy.

It is possible to be both a maester and a member of the Night's Watch, due to the similar restrictions of their vows and because the castles along the Wall each need a maester. This has always been something of a rarity, however, as even during its prime the Night's Watch only maintained nineteen castles along the Wall, and by the time of Robert's Rebellion, the number of manned castles had dwindled over the centuries to only three. Thus in the current era there are usually only three maesters who are also members of the Night's Watch. Most prominent among these is Maester Aemon, who by the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings had served as maester of Castle Black for over seventy years. Should the need arise at the Wall, it is also permissible for a member of the Night's Watch to be trained as a maester at the Citadel, then return to the Wall to serve as the maester of one of its castles.\n\nThe headquarters of the Order of Maesters is the Citadel, a complex devoted to higher learning, which is located in the city of Oldtown in the southwest of the Reach. New initiates are trained at the Citadel, and upon finishing their studies, gain the title of \"maester\" and are assigned to serve at a castle or town in Westeros. The entire order is ruled over by the Conclave, the council of archmaesters, who reside in the Citadel. \n\nThe Grand Maester is considered the most senior member of the order, and is its personal representative to the king on the Iron Throne. The Grand Maester is elected by the Conclave, but resides in the Red Keep in King's Landing, to personally advise the king and serve on the Small Council. Only the Conclave may select the Grand Maester and while the King or Hand may dismiss the Grand Maester from the council, they cannot strip him of his title.\n\nMaesters wear a chain around their necks composed of various metals to signify their personal expertise. Maesters personally forge each link themselves. Each link indicates a different field of study. There are sixteen recognized fields each with a different representative metal. Maesters are expected to wear their chains at all times, even when sleeping.\n\nKnown metals and corresponding fields of study include:\n\nnull\n\nKnown metals with unknown corresponding fields of study include\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the maesters are an all-male order of scholars and teachers. Women are not permitted to join the order. They are based in Oldtown, the continent's second-largest city on its far southwestern coast, in the Reach.\n\nWhile (prior to the TV series) many book readers mistakenly pronounced \"maester\" as \"my-stir\", George R.R. Martin actually publicly stated at least as early as 1998 that it is indeed pronounced \"may-stir\" (which is how the live-action TV series pronounces it).\n\nSubjects which the maesters can be specialized in include: herb lore, warcraft, medicine and healing, smithing, economics, history and heraldry, astronomy, ravenry, and the \"higher mysteries\" (magic), although in the latter case only to ensure that it is treated like a myth. The supreme master of such an area gains the rank of Archmaester and is allowed to sit on the ruling council of the order, the Conclave, based in the Citadel.\n\nMaesters in Westeros basically serve many of the functions that Christian monks did in real-life medieval society, being lore-masters and advisors to noble families, who are mostly responsible for promoting literature culture, and who provide many of the writing services with letters or books that real-life Christian monks or clergymen would in a medieval chancery. In the fantasy-world of Westeros, however, the maesters are entirely separate from the religious clergy (such as septons of the Faith of the Seven): maesters focus entirely on matters of learning and scientific knowledge, while clergymen focus on religious matters.\n\nThe origin of the Order of Maesters was not revealed in the first five novels of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, but the World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014), written from the perspective of a maester writing a comprehensive history Westeros, shed some light on their history. The Maesters are said to have originated in Oldtown itself, back when it was a small kingdom of the First Men - long before the Andal Invasion six thousand years ago. Thus they are not an Andal institution brought to Westeros, nor did they predate the First Men migration to Westeros. While their exact origins and development are left murky by thousands of years of history, the Citadel and its Maesters simply originated in similar fashion to real-life universities: a king of Oldtown had a passion for learning, became a great patron of the arts and sciences, and started gathering scholars and healers at his court. Over time he granted them their own land in the city to promote their studies, which became the Citadel. They formed a guild to organize their trade of scholarship (much like a merchants' guild or shipwrights' guild), and over the generations it gradually developed formalized rules, until it developed into the \"Order of Maesters\" known in later centuries, with its vows of political neutrality (and associated rules of celibacy, dissolving all past family allegiances, and holding no land and title, to reinforce this neutrality). Over the centuries, maesters spread to every major town and castle in the Seven Kingdoms (from Dorne to the North), with each maester officially assigned to his location by the Citadel.\n\nLady Dustin has a very negative opinion about maesters. She tells Theon \"If I were queen, the first thing I would do would be to kill all those grey rats. They scurry everywhere, living on the leavings of the lords, chittering to one another, whispering in the ears of their masters... Out of gratitude we give them a place beneath our roof and make them privy to all our shames and secrets, a part of every council. And before too long, the ruler has become the ruled\". She personally resents maester Walys (a predecessor of Luwin's), whom she claims came to Winterfell to fill Lord Rickard Stark\u2019s ears with poisoned words as sweet as honey, and the Tully marriage was his idea undoubtfully.\n\nAccording to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, the term is pronounced \"MAY-ster\", not \"MY-stir\", which proved tricky for the cast during filming.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Maesters"}}

Littlefinger leaves Robin in the care of Lord Royce, for further training. On the carriage ride, he is questioned by Sansa as to why they are heading west when Lord Royce was told they would be traveling to the Fingers, unsure of his source of distrust. Petyr promises her that they are going somewhere far away, where Sansa will be safe from Queen Cersei.","Baelish returns to Runestone and greets Robin Arryn and Yohn Royce. Yohn quickly voices his suspicion of Baelish's involvement in Sansa's marriage to Ramsay Bolton since Baelish had told Yohn that Sansa was going to the Fingers with him. With the intention of manipulating Robin, Baelish responds by falsely claiming the Boltons ambushed Sansa and Baelish on the way to the Fingers and insinuates that Yohn leaked the information to the Boltons. Robin's first thought is to have Yohn thrown through the Moon Door for this false treason but asks for Baelish's advice on what to do with Yohn. Baelish responds that if Yohn can ensure his loyalty to Robin Arryn, which Yohn quickly gives, that Yohn should be given a final chance. Baelish then immediately follows-up and tells Robin that he has learned that Sansa has fled Winterfell and will likely head to Castle Black for protection, though the Boltons will pursue her. Robin responds that since Sansa is his cousin, that he should help her. Baelish takes his cue and orders Yohn to gather the knights of the Vale to rescue Sansa from the Boltons.

He is at times capable of putting on a seemingly friendly face with a friendly smile - but his eyes don't smile when his mouth does. The exact inner motivations that drive Baelish are unclear, as are his ultimate goals, but he has no real loyalty or genuine affection for anyone. Behind his smiles and forced mild manners, Littlefinger is shrewd and calculating, willing to casually dispose of people who trusted him, like a man replacing a coat he no longer needs. He is an extremely intelligent man, not only a genius at financial matters but at cynically controlling those around him. As Varys observed, he is a grasper from a minor House, with a very great skill at befriending and ultimately maneuvering powerful people.\n\nLittlefinger started out as an impoverished noble from an insignificant minor House in the \"little Finger\" peninsula of the Vale, but felt constantly looked down upon for his relatively lowly status by much higher noblemen. His treatment by the Tullys when he was a young man, and his near-death at the hands of Brandon Stark, embittered him against both the Tullys and the Starks. He was also never strongly attached to the other Vale lords who looked down on him most of his life. Petyr loved Catelyn, but she saw him only like a brother, and her father wanted him to have nothing to do with her.\n\nIn truth, underneath Littlefinger's people-mask, he is a cold sociopath who hungers for power over others basically for its own sake. Curiously, even seemingly plausible goals such as \"revenge against the Starks and Tullys\" - which at times is what he tells himself he is doing - are really only excuses and rationalizations for his utter ambition to control everything around him - he has stated more than once that he wants \"everything.\" Even Littlefinger's alleged feelings for Catelyn Stark truly seem to have just been a rationalization for his greed for power. Though surely, Littlefinger himself is convinced that he truly \"loved\" her, in reality his attraction was one-sided, and he was obsessively stalking a girl who never returned his affections beyond a platonic level. Hypocritically, Littlefinger became angered that the Tullys rejected him, probably for his low social status - when Catelyn's younger sister Lysa Tully was utterly obsessed with him. Petyr, ironically, wanted nothing to do with Lysa, and used her only as a means to an end to get to Catelyn. Later after Catelyn died, Littlefinger transferred his obsession to Sansa. Even though, as he himself noted, Sansa is young enough to be his own daughter, she reminds him so much of the young Catelyn at her age that he forgets himself, even allowing himself to try to kiss her - showing that he didn't really love Catelyn as a person so much as a concept, given that he feels she is interchangeable with her daughter.\n\nIn brief moments when Littlefinger has opened up to Sansa Stark, it is disturbingly revealed that despite his keen skill at assessing the emotions and goals of others and using it to manipulate them, he has a highly warped, skewed view of the world. In Littlefinger's mind, he narrates himself as the hero of his own storybook, as it were: as he says, the weak boy from a minor family who hoped that in a better world, \"love could overcome strength and duty\". He genuinely feels (or seems to feel) that he is the victim in all of this, despite the fact that he was the one who orchestrated the entire War of the Five Kings - a war in which tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians have died. Littlefinger nonetheless believes he is the victim of the uncaring forces of a stratified aristocracy that prevented him from marrying Catelyn - when in reality, Catelyn herself was simply never romantically interested in him, regardless of his social status.\n\nPetyr's surprising lack of insight when it comes to his romantic obsessions were revealed when he encountered Catelyn again in Renly Baratheon's army camp after her husband's execution - a betrayal which Catelyn by now would surely have known he was at least partially complicit in. Instead, Petyr started babbling nonsensically to Catelyn that \"fate\" had granted them the opportunity to finally be together now that Eddard was dead - even though he previously saw that they were deeply in love, and any sane man would realize that she would be both deeply in mourning for her husband, and have reason to be suspicious that he had something to do with his death. Littlefinger's stalker-crush extended to the point that even after years of bitterly hating the Tullys and Starks, and even hating Catelyn at times for rejecting him, at other times he would persist to indulge in fantasies that one day she would come running into his arms.\n\nSome men such as Varys engage in court intrigue and engage in murder because they feel they are doing what they must to ensure safety and order for the realm as a whole, while other men such as Tywin Lannister engage in court intrigue because they want to secure more power for themselves and for their family legacy. Baelish, meanwhile, does these things just because he can: he enjoys exerting power over other people. Sometimes this can take the form of out-witting or out-manipulating major court players such as Varys or Cersei - even Tyrion Lannister enjoyed the challenge of \"the game\". Yet Littlefinger also enjoys crushing the powerless when he thinks he can get away with it, people who pose no threat to him. Baelish's acquisition of multiple brothels sums up a major aspect of his personality: he is willing to use other people, often vulnerable and weak people (i.e., prostitutes), purely for his own gain (cynically selling his whores' sexual services for gold), while at the same time using the weaknesses of his enemies as leverage (i.e., blackmailing them about their visits to his brothels). Sometimes Baelish doesn't even use people for any actual purpose, but simply because he enjoys destroying them like a man swatting a fly.\n\nDespite his ingenious planning and manipulation, Baelish is not incapable of making mistakes, nor is he above overplaying his hand if he is convinced of the superiority of his position, political or otherwise, which is a direct contrast to Littlefinger's usual meek and cautious nature, proving himself not above arrogance. The first mistake was when he subtly made a jab at Cersei about her unnatural relationship with her brother Jaime, that knowledge is power, which resulted in Cersei nearly having him killed before deciding to remind him of his place. Another fatal flaw Baelish has is underestimating people. He remarked to Varys that Tyrion is an unworthy ally, seemingly underestimated Ramsay Bolton's vile nature, wrongly believed that the North would not rally behind a \"motherless bastard\" like Jon Snow, and was initially skeptical of Bran Stark's omniscience as the new three-eyed raven.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Petyr_Baelish"}}

According to Grand Maester Munkun however, Viserys did not squander the progress made under his predecessor.\n\nHis first wife Aemma Arryn, who was much younger than Viserys, was unable to give Viserys a son, only a daughter (Rhaenyra Targaryen).

He is the steward of the Twins, managing the day-to-day running of the castle. He often plans and organizes the fine details to achieve his father's goals.\n\nLothar travels to Riverrun with Lord Walder's bastard son, Black Walder Rivers, and meets with King Robb Stark and his advisors to discuss the reforging of the Stark-Frey alliance for Robb's planned attack on Casterly Rock. The Freys carry Lord Walder's demands, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle of Harrenhal and all of its lands and incomes, and for Edmure Tully to marry Roslin, one of his daughters. Edmure is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced to go through with the arrangement.\n\nLothar hires a group of assassins to pose as musicians at Edmure and Roslin's wedding. Talisa Stark comments on their talent, and Lothar replies that they should want to be good due to their cost. After the bedding ceremony, Lord Walder rises to make a toast to Robb and offer a marriage gift to his Queen, signaling Lothar to draw a knife from his sleeve and repeatedly stab the pregnant Talisa in the stomach, killing her and her unborn child. He presumably participates in the ensuing massacre.\n\nLothar and Black Walder inform their father that Brynden Tully has retaken Riverrun, and of the opposition they face from other Riverlands houses and the Brotherhood Without Banners. Walder admonishes his sons for letting the Blackfish slip through their fingers at the Red Wedding, and orders them to retake Riverrun by using the captive Edmure for bargaining with. He also tells Lothar to present Brynden with the knife he used to kill Talisa Stark and her unborn child. Lothar and Black Walder command the Second Siege of Riverrun. They prove to be incompetent commanders and fail to secure their flanks or to dig trenches. In an attempt to force the Blackfish to surrender, they force Edmure to wear a noose around his neck and threaten to kill him. However, the Blackfish is undaunted and calls their bluff. Later, House Lannister reinforcements arrive under Jaime Lannister and Bronn. Jaime chastises the Freys for their incompetence and takes command of the siege. He also orders Lothar and Black Walder to feed and wash Edmure. When Black Walder refuses, Jaime backhands him across the face and informs the Freys that they can return home if they do not agree with his methods. Lothar is apologetic and sycophantic in contrast to his half-brother.\n\nLothar is later present at the Twins, where the Freys and the Lannisters celebrate their successful siege of Riverrun. He is afterwards killed by Arya Stark, who presumably learns (while disguised as a servant) of how he killed her pregnant sister-in-law. She minces his flesh and bakes him into a pie together with Black Walder, which she then serves to their father before slitting his throat, as Black Walder did to her mother.\n\nLothar and Black Walder's remaining male family members are poisoned by Arya, who hosts a banquet using the face of their father.\n\nWhen asked by Hot Pie if she has made any pies recently, Arya repsonds with \"a few\", referring to the deaths of Lothar and Black Walder.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lothar_Frey"}}

He is named for Eddard Stark's father, Rickard, and fought in Robert's Rebellion alongside his liege lord.

He is a close ally and distant relation of House Stark. He has three sons, Torrhen Karstark, Harrion Karstark, and Harald Karstark, and one granddaughter, Alys Karstark.\n\nLord Karstark listens to the debate between Robb Stark, Jonos Bracken and Greatjon Umber about whether they should join forces with Renly or Stannis Baratheon. When the Greatjon names Robb as the King in the North and lays his sword at his feet, Karstark is the second to join him, saying he'll have peace on those terms.\n\nRickard Karstark is among Robb Stark's host in the Westerlands and is present when Alton Lannister gives Queen Cersei Lannister's response to Robb's peace terms. Karstark's son Torrhen Karstark is later killed by Jaime Lannister during an escape attempt. After Jaime's recapture, Lord Rickard demands Jaime's execution in revenge for the murder of his son, but Catelyn Stark speaks for his life. After Lord Rickard's threatening reaction, she reminds him that he has sworn an oath of loyalty to Robb Stark and that Jaime is a prisoner of war. She says that he should remember who his king is and who she is. She promises him that Jaime will be punished for what he did. Reluctantly Lord Karstark gives in, but demands retribution when his King returns from The Crag. During the confrontation with Lady Catelyn, Lord Rickard also dismisses Talisa Maegyr as a \"foreign bitch\".\n\nCatelyn sends Jaime to King's Landing with her sworn sword Brienne to exchange him for her captive daughters, fearing that Rickard or his men will kill him if he remains in the camp. He is furious that she has denied him his vengeance and rejects her argument that Jaime may yet save the lives of her children, adding that he personally would happily exchange his life for those of his deceased children, Torrhen and Harrion, even if it meant captivity for them. Robb tells Catelyn that she has betrayed him and orders her kept under guard.\n\nRickard's faith in Robb continues to deteriorate as the Northern host arrives at Harrenhal, finding the castle's inhabitants had been put to the sword. Roose Bolton attempts to reassure Rickard, telling him that he has sent his best hunter in pursuit of the Kingslayer, and that the dead will be avenged in time. Karstark, however, is clearly unconvinced.\n\nLord Karstark manifests his disapproval of the march to Riverrun for the funerals of Lord Hoster Tully, grandfather of his King, considering it a distraction from the war effort. When questioned by Robb if he has lost faith in the Northern cause, Lord Karstark insists that if the cause is revenge he will keep faith \"until it snows in Dorne\", but adds that he believes Robb lost the war the day he married Talisa Maegyr.\n\nRickard Karstark and his men kill Martyn and Willem Lannister in the dungeons of Riverrun and are brought before Robb Stark. He openly insults the King in the North and claims the war is a lost cause. Remaining true to his honor just like his father, Robb decides that Lord Karstark must die for his treason. Though Edmure Tully, Talisa, and Catelyn attempt to advise Robb to hold Karstark hostage and send him to the Night's Watch after the war - on the basis that the Karstarks form a significant portion of Robb's army, and they will abandon Robb if he executes their lord. Despite the warnings of all of his councilors, Robb refuses to listen.  As Lord Karstark is brought before Robb, he reminds him that the blood of the First Men run through both of their veins since they are of the North. Lord Karstark also reminds Robb he fought alongside Eddard Stark during Robert's Rebellion and alongside him against King Joffrey. Finally, he states that they are both kin, since House Karstark was founded by a Stark of Winterfell. Robb tells him that all of it didn't stop him from murdering the Lannister boys and it will not save him now. Rickard doesn't want to be saved, but he wants it to haunt him for the rest of his days. True to the traditions of the North and his father, Robb Stark personally beheads Rickard Karstark with a single strike of his sword after Rickard curses Robb and renounces all allegiance to him. In the aftermath, the Karstark forces abandon Robb and return home.\n\nIn the meantime, while he is being tortured in the Dreadfort, Theon Greyjoy incorrectly assumes Ramsay Snow to be Rickard's son, keeping him prisoner on Rickard's orders, since he is Robb's bannerman, remaining unaware that Rickard has been executed.\n\nRickard is mentioned by his last living son Harald Karstark when he meets with the Boltons at Winterfell. Harald makes it clear that his house will never support the Starks again after Robb executed his father. Despite the fact that Roose avenged his father by killing Robb at the Red Wedding, Harald makes no attempt to intervene when Ramsay kills Roose after the birth of his half-brother, whom Ramsay also murders along with his stepmother, Walda Bolton.\n\nWhile planning to counter the Boltons' claim to the North, Sansa Stark expresses her belief that the Karstarks will support them when they learn of Jon Snow's resurrection, but Ser Davos Seaworth reminds her that Rickard was executed by Robb, which is likely why Rickard's last surviving son has sided with the Starks' enemies and not out of ignorance as Sansa had hoped.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rickard_Karstark"}}

When Ned attempted to expose the truth of Joffrey's parentage, his men were executed and he was captured due to the treachery of Littlefinger. He was executed on the order of King Joffrey."],"name":"Eddard Stark","description":"Eddard Stark was a man of principle, being patient, cautious, intelligent, noble and possessing an immense sense of duty. He was remembered profusely for being extremely honorable and a firmly moral character at heart. He always reacted to situations calmly and reasonably, even if the situations endangered him or the people he loved. He was a skilled and fierce warrior but certainly preferred the diplomatic and peaceful solution to situations, even if that solution was martial law. He, himself, remarked that he didn't fear death, and recollected that he grew up with soldiers - Cersei elaborated that Eddard's older brother Brandon was born to lead, whilst he  was born to follow. In his own words, Ned explained that he \"learned how to die a long time ago.\" Ned viewed situations and individuals by the scope of their moral compass, and judged almost everything on that perspective. He also speculated the concept that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword, showing that he can be pragmatic in his sense of honor. In spite of that, he was not narrow-minded and did not appear prejudiced, arrogant or self-serving.\n\nNed was a very loving father to all of his children, including Jon Snow, his \"bastard son\", even though Catelyn was of a different opinion. He was very patient with the romantic delusions that Sansa enjoyed, visibly tolerating the fact that she was obsessed with being married to a handsome prince. He did point out to her that Joffrey lacked bravery, strength of character, and even morality, but she didn't listen. He was also on great terms with Arya, and seemed to be one of few who could tolerate her feisty, adventurous mentality, and even encouraged it. He was, in many ways, like his son Robb, in that his sense of honor and duty ruled every aspect of his being, and he was a charismatic leader to those who served him. Ned had a close relationship with Jon Snow, who Ned raised as his own child alongside his lawful children. Like Robb, Jon inherited Ned\u2019s traits of honor and duty. Ned treated Jon as his son - regardless of his legitimacy, and despite Jon being his nephew, and not his son. Ned was willing to sacrifice his own honor to protect Jon, and spent years letting everyone - including his whole family - believe that Jon was his bastard son to ensure Jon's protection. Ned's death provoked such a brutal reaction from all of his family because they all loved him more than words could say.\n\nEddard was highly skilled in combat, both in strategy and in a duel. He killed Ser Gerold Hightower, survived the Battle of the Trident and held his own impressively against the younger Jaime Lannister. He had earned the respect of men like Ser Arthur Dayne, the greatest warrior of his generation - indeed, Ned's sense of honor seemed to impress everyone around him, including the rigid and cold Stannis Baratheon and the cunning Varys. Aside from being selfless, dutiful and brave, he was slow to anger and thus he was one of the very, very few who could withstand the temper and misgivings of Robert Baratheon, with whom he shared a relationship that was a hair's breadth from being considered a brotherly one. Robert actually admitted that he never loved Stannis or Renly Baratheon, and had instead labelled Ned as his brother, showing that Robert's admiration for his old comrade was tremendous. Ned's calm and reasonable mentality was respected firmly by Robert, who recognized that Ned was the only one who would dare say no to him for the right reasons. Robert obviously trusted Ned, begging him on his deathbed to help Jofffrey in a way that Robert himself had failed and even naming the man as Protector of the Realm until Joffrey came of age. However, he had the fatal weakness of being a poor politician, preferring to take the honorable route than doing what would politically benefit him - Cersei speculated that, in the game of thrones, one had to take what was in arm's reach or be damned, but Ned disagreed because the fight he fought was never to survive, but to preserve the lives of those he loved.\n\nEddard Stark's honorable and dutiful personality put him at a weakness of judging people impractically by the evidence he saw with his own eyes, as opposed to the bigger picture. He had a bad habit of trusting people, which was a mistake he disastrously made with Petyr Baelish. He also did not predict that Cersei Lannister would be unreasonable enough to turn down his offer of mercy if and when Robert found out that Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella weren't his children; a mistake that cost Ned not just his own life, but set off a chain of events that has also so far led to the deaths of his wife and two of his sons. Still, Cersei's refusal also ironically led to the deaths of all three of her own children, an outcome that Ned sought to prevent in the first place when he confronted Cersei despite the trauma that her son Joffrey had visited upon his daughters on the kingsroad. Finally, he judged Jaime Lannister to have betrayed his king for dishonorable reasons the moment he discovered the Kingslayer sitting on the Iron Throne with the Mad King's corpse lying at his feet, though Jaime's arrogance did nothing to dispel this misconception. Ned would have probably understood if Jaime explained how Aerys ordered him to kill his father Tywin, since Ned would never have followed that kind of order even if such a refusal would have cost him his life.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Eddard_Stark"}}

Arianne repeats her suggestion to make Myrcella lie about the incident."],"name":"Doran Martell","description":"Doran Martell was the Prince of Dorne and the Lord of Sunspear. He was the head of House Martell, the ruling house of Dorne, and the older brother of the late Princess Elia, who was murdered along with her children, Rhaenys and Aegon, by Ser Gregor Clegane in the Sack of King's Landing, and Prince Oberyn, known as The Red Viper, also killed by Clegane.\n\nHe suffered from a severe case of gout, which mostly prevented him from walking and restricted him to a wheelchair.\n\nUnlike his more hotheaded and aggressive brother, Oberyn, Doran was a pensive, calculating, and patient man who always waited and observed before making his next move. Despite their different personalities, the two brothers were very close. While Oberyn could indulge in the wayward Dornish ways, challenging whomever he liked regardless of the consequences, Doran was raised to be more responsible as the heir to the Dornish throne. He truly cared for both his people and his family, and would never make a decision that would go against their interests. However, this was often against their wishes, and this resulted in his becoming an unpopular ruler.\n\nDoran had also been a witness to war and was deeply marked by its consequences. As such, he often tried to find a solution that avoided waging war, even if the honor of House Martell had been offended. This, along with his physical weakness, gave some people the impression that he was weak-willed and easily dominated, but this was misleading; Doran was just as ruthless and decisive as any other member of House Martell. He was simply better at hiding it - until the moment that he struck.\n\nTyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King, proposes a marriage alliance to Prince Doran, offering the hand of Princess Myrcella Baratheon to be wedded to Doran's son when both come of age. Queen Cersei Lannister resists the idea, insisting her daughter would be a political hostage under House Martell, who notoriously hate the Lannisters. However, when Prince Doran accepts the alliance, Myrcella is sent to Dorne as a ward of his House.\n\nPrince Doran is expected to arrive at King's Landing for the Royal Wedding. Due to his poor health, however, his younger brother Oberyn travels to the capital instead.\n\nDuring Joffrey and Margaery's wedding, Tywin Lannister inquires after Prince Doran's health, revealing that he suffers from gout and is unable to walk. Oberyn reassures Tywin that his brother is fine.\n\nPrince Doran is overlooking the Water Gardens with Captain Areo Hotah when Ellaria Sand approaches him. Angered, she berates Doran for simply doing nothing when he learned how Oberyn was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane. Doran reminds her that Oberyn died fighting in a trial by combat, which by law is not considered murder. Doran intends to bury and mourn his brother, but Ellaria and Oberyn's daughters want Dorne to take up arms and avenge Oberyn. She also wants to harm Myrcella Baratheon in order to send Cersei Lannister a message. Doran reassures Ellaria that, as Oberyn's paramour, he will always love her, but he strictly forbids her from harming Myrcella while he rules. Ellaria doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing, and then storms off. Hotah and the Prince exchange a look as she departs, the former meaningfully indicating his axe, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the Water Gardens.\n\nDoran watches with Areo as Myrcella and Trystane take another walk through the Water Gardens. The prince comments that their betrothal is dangerous as their Houses hate each other and they needed to be protected from those who would harm them. He asks Areo if he remembers how to use his longaxe, as it has been a long time that he hasn't used it. Areo reassures him that he remembers how to use it.\n\nJaime Lannister later arrives at the Water Gardens and tries to take Myrcella but is stopped by the Sand Snakes who also try to take Myrcella for their own ends. As Nymeria tries to take Myrcella, Areo arrives with the Prince's guard and arrests them all on Doran's orders. Ellaria is also arrested for leading the Sand Snakes. Sometime later, Doran invites Jaime to eat and drink with him, Trystane, Myrcella, and Ellaria. He inquires why Jaime  came to Dorne with stealth to take Myrcella rather than send a raven or a messenger. When Jaime reveals that Myrcella's necklace had been sent as a threat to King's Landing, Doran deduces Ellaria was the one who sent the message. Jaime makes a comment about his upcoming beheading but Doran tells him that he can't behead him and that, having seen war before, he doesn't want to inflict it on his people, despite vocal cries from his bannermen for it. He offers to send Myrcella back to King's Landing on the condition that Trystane accompany her and that their engagement stand, to secure the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne. He also demands that Trystane be granted Oberyn's seat on the Small Council. When she hears Doran appeasing the Lannisters, Ellaria stands and tells him that he doesn't have a spine, which explains his inability to walk. Before she storms out, Doran restrains her and warns her that, if she speaks to him as such again, her life would be short, something he doesn't want as she is mother to four of his nieces.\n\nOnce Ellaria leaves, Jaime asks about his companion, Bronn. Doran asks what they would do to a commoner who struck a prince in King's Landing. Jaime takes the blame, claiming that Bronn had only been following his orders. Doran defers to Trystane to decide Bronn's punishment. Trystane agrees to release Bronn but requests that Areo slap him as he had been slapped, to his father's approval.  Later, he summons Ellaria before him, along with the three imprisoned Sand Snakes. He tells his brother's lover that her rebellion is over and that he will grant her mercy if she swears loyalty to him on threat of death. A tearful Ellaria kneels and kisses his ring. He then threateningly tells her that while he believes in second chances, it will be the last time he pardons her.\n\nDoran, Ellaria, and the Sand Snakes are present for Princess Myrcella's departure for King's Landing with Jaime, Bronn, and Trystane. He bids her farewell, and gives Ellaria a nod, allowing her to give Cersei's daughter a kiss, though she has coated her lips with a fatal poison. Myrcella dies from the poison, though only after their boat has left the shore, while Doran remains unaware that Ellaria betrayed him again.\n\nWhile walking through the Gardens with Ellaria, Doran admits to her that he always envied Oberyn and wanted to travel like he did, though Ellaria consoles him by claiming Doran was better-suited to rule than Oberyn was. The warm moment, however, is shattered when Maester Caleotte brings news of Myrcella's death, which Doran realizes was Ellaria's doing. Before he can react, however, Areo Hotah is stabbed in the back by Tyene, and Doran is stabbed in the chest by Ellaria. In shock and disbelief, Doran attempts to grab Ellaria to strangle her, but she throws him from his chair. Ellaria voices her contempt for Doran for his inaction for the deaths of Elia and Oberyn, while the rest of the palace guards, also dissatisfied with Doran's rule, stand and watch as Doran bleeds out. Before succumbing, Doran begs Ellaria to spare Trystane, but she refuses and has him killed by Obara and Nymeria, all as part of their plan to take over Dorne. With the deaths of Doran and Trystane, House Martell is rendered legally extinct.\n\nMonths later, Olenna Tyrell voices her distrust for the Sands, citing their cold-blooded murder of Doran as an example.\n\nA small justice is enacted for Doran when Ellaria and Tyene are sentenced to life imprisonment and death, respectively, by Cersei Lannister.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Doran_Martell"}}

Though believed by most to be the eldest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey is actually a bastard born from Cersei's incestuous relationship with her twin brother, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard. He is the older brother of Myrcella Baratheon and Tommen Baratheon, both of whom share the same parentage.","Joffrey takes after his mother in terms of looks and personality, his blond hair being a subtle clue that he isn't really a Baratheon, who famously always possess black hair even when only one parent is Baratheon. Cersei herself lets it slip to Catelyn Stark that she once had a child with black hair who died prematurely before she had Joffrey. He is usually accompanied by his sworn shield, the formidable Sandor Clegane, better known as the Hound. Even before he ascends to the Iron Throne, Joffrey is spoiled, arrogant, cowardly, and sadistic, though he tends to hide them before his ascension. These traits are further exacerbated upon Robert's death and his ascension to the crown.","Prince Joffrey accompanies his parents to Winterfell and is betrothed to marry Sansa Stark as part of King Robert's plan unite House Baratheon to House Stark by blood. Both seem happy with the prospect, and Joffrey is charming and polite towards Sansa. However, he shows no sympathy when Bran falls from a tower and is severely injured, and has to be physically chastised by his uncle Tyrion before he will pay his respects to Bran's parents.While on the Kingsroad to King's Landing, Joffrey is walking with Sansa and chances upon her sister Arya practicing sword play with a commoner, Mycah. Joffrey sees a chance to have some fun with Mycah, who is too scared to move. Joffrey accuses him of assault on a noble girl and starts to slice into his face with his sword. Enraged, Arya hits Joffrey, allowing the butcher's boy to get away. When Joffrey turns on Arya and threatens her, her direwolf Nymeria reacts in defense of her mistress and mauls Joffrey's right arm, and Arya throws his sword in the river. Joffrey begs for his life. Sansa offers her aid, but Joffrey is angry at her because she saw him so weak and defeated. Later, he lies about the incident and says he was attacked in an unprovoked manner. King Robert knows Joffrey is lying, and is disgusted that Joffrey let a little girl disarm him, but agrees to forget about the incident in return for the death of Nymeria. When she cannot be found, Sansa's direwolf Lady is executed instead. In King's Landing, Joffrey tells his mother about how he would handle the people of the North as she treats his injury. He suggests capturing Winterfell, taxing the people hard and forcing their warriors to join a \"royal army\". Cersei elucidates the flaws in his plan and warns Joffrey that a king needs to be more careful in choosing his battles. Cersei tells her son that, \"Everyone who isn't us is an enemy\". She also urges Joffrey to do something nice for Sansa to win back her goodwill.Eddard Stark discovers that Joffrey isn't King Robert's son and rightful heir, by examining the family history and realizing that black hair is a dominant trait in the Baratheon line. Eddard realizes that Joffrey's true parentage can be attributed to the incestuous relationship between his mother and his \"uncle\" Jaime Lannister. Meanwhile, Joffrey wins back Sansa's affection by giving her a pendant.","Joffrey rewards Tywin by naming him Savior of the City. He also grants a favor to House Tyrell for their aid and Ser Loras asks Joffrey to unite their houses in marriage. Joffrey balks at setting aside his betrothal to Sansa, but is easily convinced in a sham dialogue with his mother and courtiers and agrees to marry Margaery Tyrell.","At a meeting of the small council, Joffrey gleefully informs Tyrion of the deaths of Robb Stark and Catelyn Stark, brutally slaughtered alongside scores of their bannermen at the Red Wedding. He tells Grand Maester Pycelle to thank Walder Frey for his service and wants to serve Robb's head to Sansa at his wedding feast. Lord Varys and Tyrion take offense to this, and Tyrion threatens the king again. Tywin interjects by saying that he has won Joffrey's war for him. Joffrey angrily states that his supposed father won the real war, while Tywin hid in Casterly Rock during the fighting. Tywin orders that Joffrey be put to bed, and given Essence of Nightshade to sedate him. Joffrey is reluctantly taken to his chambers by Cersei.","Joffrey then announces some entertainment that he has organized: a group of dwarfs crudely re-enacting the War of the Five Kings and fighting each other. Joffrey laughs hysterically during the show, spitting wine all over himself, though many others in attendance clearly find the spectacle distasteful.","Becoming stressed with Jon Snow's reign as King in the North, Sansa remarks showed similar behaviour, as he never listens to anyone on how to rule. Jon then questions if he is anything like Joffrey, to which Sansa replies he is the furthest from Joffrey she has ever known.","* Only appears as a corpse.","Spoken by Joffrey                        Spoken about Joffrey","In the books, Joffrey dies after the other two \"usurpers\" Balon and Robb, against whom Stannis and Melisandre performed the leech ritual. Similarly to the deaths of Balon and Robb, it seems that Joffrey's death did not get Stannis even one step closer to the Iron Throne. However, since Stannis is still alive in the books, it can be argued that Joffrey's death may assist him indirectly: it has triggered a chain of events that resulted in Tywin's death - and from that point began the gradual decline of House Lannister, mainly due to Cersei's total incompetence as a ruler. Considering how far the show strayed from the books (in respect of the plotlines of Sansa, Dorne and more), it is not impossible that Stannis will survive the battle of Winterfell, and may take advantage of the unstable state of affairs at King's Landing.","Fans sometimes derisively assume that \"Joffrey Baratheon\" should really be called \"Joffrey Lannister\", because of his status as the bastard offspring of the incestuous relationship between Cersei Lannister and Jaime Lannister, and not the son of King Robert Baratheon at all. This is actually in error, as according to the customs of bastardy, Joffrey doesn't even have the right to use the surname \"Lannister\". As Jaime's bastard son, given birth to by a woman from the Westerlands (Cersei), Joffrey would have to use the bastard surname for the Westerlands: \"Joffrey Hill\". There's also the possibility that he might be called \"Joffrey Waters\" given that both Jaime and Cersei had been living in the Crownlands for many years, and Joffrey lived his whole life there. All of this, of course, would only happen if Jaime were to openly acknowledge Joffrey as his son, which is an impossibility given the disastrous political fallout this would create. Further, as the product of not merely bastardy, but incest, the Faith of the Seven would want to outright kill Joffrey as an abomination before the gods if his actual parentage were ever revealed. Therefore from a strict legal standpoint, given that Jaime will never acknowledge his children with Cersei, Joffrey has no right to any surname, and should properly just be called \"Joffrey\" as if he were a lowborn commoner.","Joffrey is stated to be 17 years old in the TV series at the time of the Battle of the Blackwater, as stated in \"The Prince of Winterfell\". Most of the younger characters in the TV series were aged-up by about two years compared to their book counterparts (i.e. Sansa states that she is 13 years old in the first episode of Season 1, but is 11 in the first novel). Making Joffrey 17 years old in the TV series drastically increases his age relative to the other characters, however, as he is stated to be only 13 years old during the Battle of the Blackwater in the novels (the Tournament he holds in the beginning of book\/Season 2 is to celebrate his nameday). This would make TV-Joffrey 16 years old in Season 1, which is stated to be 17 years after Robert and Cersei were married at the end of Robert's Rebellion (which was increased from 15 years ago in the TV series). Cersei also states that she became pregnant with a son by Robert at the very beginning of her marriage who died in infancy. Assuming that Cersei's first son died even a few days after birth, this requires a nine month pregnancy, plus another nine month pregnancy before Joffrey was born (assuming she became pregnant quite soon after her first son died), meaning Joffrey could have been born no earlier than sixteen and a half years before the beginning of the narrative - drastically increasing Joffrey's age to sixteen years old in Season 1 strains the plausibility of this timetable, and drastically increasing his age by four years instead of two like the other characters may have been a dialogue error in \"The Prince of Winterfell\", in order to make a forced comparison between Joffrey and how Jaime was such a skilled warrior at seventeen that he became the youngest man ever to join the Kingsguard. Another possibility is that Tyrion meant that Joffrey was almost 17 and that he was actually 16 during Season 2."],"name":"Joffrey Baratheon","description":"Joffrey was a cruel, arrogant, sadistic, malicious, egotistical, and tyrannical ruler. He hugely enjoyed the agony of others, and playing sadistic games with them (for example, giving a man a choice between losing his fingers or his tongue), and even joyously speculating serving Sansa Stark the head of her brother Robb at his wedding feast. However, he was also incompetent, unintelligent, naive, impulsive, petulant, extremely cowardly, and prone to rash outbursts of violence when angered, frightened or even mildly slighted. Much like earlier Targaryen kings, it was suspected that Joffrey's sociopathic behavior was a result of his incestuous bloodline (though his sister and brother both were of a kinder disposition). As well as being intensely sadistic, Joffrey was consumed by megalomaniacal delusions of grandeur, even though he was absurdly unskilled at ruling, making far more problems than he solved (though he was literally unable to see this and unapologetic for doing so).\n\nHe was convinced that he deserved praise and utter devotion from everyone around him because of his purported royal blood. Even though at the start of the War of the Five Kings most of the realm rose in rebellion against him, to the point that his faction essentially controlled only The Westerlands, The Crownlands, and a narrow strip of the southern Riverlands between them, Joffrey was convinced that he was the greatest king in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Added to what was an unstable personality to begin with, Cersei utterly spoiled and indulged Joffrey his entire life, resulting in him possessing a massive sense of entitlement, along with having no impulse and self-control due to getting whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it, which knew no rational bounds. Cersei also outright told him that the world could be exactly as he wanted it to be, and this fuelled his narcissism to an extreme. Moreover, his father-figure King Robert was largely absent from his life and a terrible role-model, with his constant drinking and whoring (though Robert, at least, lamented on his deathbed that he hadn't been a good father).\n\nHe was deceitful, but showed even less tact than his mother. He was willing to take advantage of the trust that Sansa Stark initially placed in him, when she was blinded by fantasies of marrying her handsome prince. In general, however, Joffrey was usually too short-sighted to bother lying, often simply committing various atrocities in public, without concern for the consequences. Joffrey had precious little restraint emotionally, and would continuously resort to petty, impractical, illogical and childlike delights on violent degrees - for example, pouring wine over Tyrion's head, grinning at the brief duel between the Mountain and the Hound or sneering whilst scarring Mycah. Like a wild animal, he would cling on to any sadistic urge that clung to his mind, and never truly considered the long-term repercussions of his actions (Not unlike his mother Cersei, funnily enough). His execution of Ned Stark was more than likely an impulse decision for his own sole and personal enjoyment, than for the latter's supposed treason, and was a politically disastrous move that plunged the Seven Kingdoms into war.\n\nJoffrey's view on his own family (immediate and alleged both) was extremely influenced by his own impulsiveness and self-absorption. Despite her protectiveness of him and that she had somewhat supported him his entire life, he was entirely comfortable being misogynistic and condescending towards Cersei - insulting her status as a woman, and mocking Robert Baratheon's disloyalty to her. Joffrey taunted and belittled his true father Jaime Lannister as an unexceptional knight and for the loss of his hand, believing he was his uncle. In addition, he apparently bullied and tormented Tommen and Myrcella their entire lives, never connecting with them the way, for example, the Starks did, and even considering Tommen weak for crying like any normal person. Even his grandfather Tywin Lannister was a person he held in contempt, being arrogant enough to furiously accuse Tywin of being a coward during Robert's Rebellion, in comparison to Robert Baratheon (who climactically killed Rhaegar Targaryen in combat and took the crown for himself). This particular scene is interesting, because Joffrey did almost exactly this: Tyrion and Tywin fought, bled and prevailed against the insurgent Stannis Baratheon, while Joffrey hid behind the walls of the Red Keep without even killing a single invader personally. Based on all this, Robert was probably the only relative that Joffrey held in any high regard - and Robert wasn't even Joffrey's father. The worst relationship that Joffrey had was with his uncle Tyrion, and on several occasions Tyrion stymied and accosted Joffrey for his sadistic, cruel and arrogant actions, and Joffrey at several points went to petty means of mocking and deriding him. This probably influenced Joffrey's urge to point at Tyrion mere moments before he died, as one final stab at his uncle for so much as standing in his way.\n\nJoffrey was obsessed with the self-conception that he was a great warrior like King Robert, but displayed no martial skill. Joffrey never raised a weapon against an enemy combatant in his entire life, despite bragging melodramatically that he would personally cut down Robb Stark and Stannis Baratheon in battle (which he never came close to at any point in the war). Particularly, despite the fact that his faction was losing the war and bracing for a siege in King's Landing, Joffrey insisted that was the time for him to strike against the Stark forces as they were distracted by the Fall of Winterfell. However, Tyrion pointed out that his own city was on the verge of attack by Stannis's superior forces. His delusions are so extensive that during breakfast prior to his wedding - Joffrey noted, after receiving the Valyrian steel sword Widow's Wail, that using it would be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again - implying that he was the one who beheaded Lord Eddard, even though he simply ordered it and Ilyn Payne was the one who actually beheaded him. He also boasted, before the Battle of the Blackwater, that he would personally engage Stannis and kill him in combat, but never crossed the latter in combat throughout the entirety of the battle. Later on, to add stupidity to absurdity, he arrogantly claimed that he saved King's Landing and personally broke Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of Blackwater, when it was in fact entirely down to his uncle and grandfather's military efforts, whereas Joffrey turned coward and fled the battle, and Stannis himself was not entirely broken because he could still pose a threat to his opponents in the war and his claim still stood to reason. His bloodlust was often overpowered by sheer cowardice. He rarely killed manually nor did he initiate a fight in which he had an extremely unfair advantage or begging or walking away when he lost this advantage. Because of this he preferred tormenting animals rather than fighting warriors and regularly went on hunts because of this (akin to Robert, but at least the latter was legitimately skilled at fighting men).\n\nAptly described as a vicious idiot by his uncle Tyrion, Joffrey was not simply a ruthless exceedingly, cruel tyrant, but absurdly incompetent. While Robert was also not skilled at ruling (though not as bad as Joffrey), he was at least respected as a great warrior. Joffrey, in contrast, had no redeeming values whatsoever: literally his only claim to rule was that he was the son of Robert, the previous king. The great irony, of course, was that Joffrey was actually Jaime's bastard son and had no valid claim to the throne, but a shockingly large number of Joffrey's followers continued to blindly obey his crazed orders without question. After hearing the rumors of his true parentage, Joffrey unwisely ordered that all of Robert's bastards be killed to make sure nobody would legitimately challenge his claim, which backfired drastically and only served to heighten suspicions when the people saw it as Joffrey destroying the evidence of the truth. This is one of the several occasions where Joffrey overextends himself, the other being when he apparently sends Ser Mandon Moore to kill Tyrion during the Battle of Blackwater Bay, ignoring two factors: Tyrion was leading Joffrey's men against Stannis when Joffrey abandoned the battle; also the Kinsguard (at least, by reputation) only ever serve major members of the royal family, among whom Joffrey is supreme, and his hatred of Tyrion is far too well known. Thus, Joffrey's actions are never properly calculated, and he never anticipates repercussions from them.\n\nJoffery possesses all of the classical traits of sociopathy, as he possesses an outrageous temper, is delusional, and quick to torment and harm anyone who displeases him. He is known for his unstable mannerisms and affect when insulted, and has a short fuse to say the least. His ability to feel empathy is extraordinarily limited (if its even there at all), and has no ability or desire to expand it, and he is entirely apathetic and even cold towards his brother Tommen when the latter cries over the departure of his sister Myrcella - he even conceitedly claimed that princes shouldn't cry, despite the fact that he was witnessed crying himself. When confronted with this fact, he brushed it aside when Sansa pointed out that her brother Rickon cried himself, to which Joffrey claimed it was irrelevant because Rickon Stark wasn't a prince and Joffrey was, but he did not stop to speculate that this didn't make the slightest scrap of difference.\n\nOnce in a while, Joffrey does make a valid point, such as that the feudal levy system in the Seven Kingdoms is somewhat antiquated, or that his advisors should be worried about Daenerys Targaryen reportedly hatching three new dragons in Essos or that his grandfather Tywin Lannister bided his time before he finally aided the rebels during Robert's Rebellion. Joffrey was capable of logic but only if the solution was absurdly obvious and even then he got it wrong. After being poisoned at his wedding feast he (incorrectly) assumed that it was Tyrions' doing. Presumably, he came to this conclusion due to his uncles constant chiding, insulting and threatening as well his use of physical punishment to discipline his wild, uncontrollable nephew or the fact that he was made cupbearer and the only person who held the opportunity to poison his wine (this makes no sense, however, as Joffrey made Tyrion his cupbearer on the spot to humiliate him further and he would have no chance to poison him). His hatred of his uncle might have also been a factor in this conclusion.\n\nGenerally, however, Joffrey only rarely made a valid insight as a means for the narrative to underscore that everyone else is overlooking something, i.e. \"if someone as stupid as Joffrey realized this, it should have been obvious to everyone else\". Even on those first two points Joffrey was quite short-sighted: he was concerned about Daenerys in the far east, despite the fact that Robb Stark was already leading major armies in rebellion in Westeros itself, and didn't consider that he should concentrate on the much more immediate threat (which is how Tyrion reacted to news of Daenerys). Similarly, while he vaguely said that having a standing royal army was better than using feudal levies, Cersei had to explain to him that his suggestion for how to make one was too impractical to work (if a royal army conscripts men from the North, they still wouldn't feel enthusiastic about attacking their fellow Northmen). Joffrey may also have been correct when he said that the Stark forces were distracted after the Fall of Winterfell, and that would have been the perfect opportunity to strike, but once again Tyrion had to remind him that his own city was preparing for a siege by Stannis Baratheon. Despite his lack of technical abilities and shortcomings in battle or combat, he was surprisingly knowledgeable on crossbows which he demonstrates to Margaery, knowing their make and models, effectiveness and was able to use them averagely well. His only direct kill with one, however, was Ros a prostitute whom he restrained and it was shown that he missed his shot multiple times due to the scattered arrows across the room.\n\nDespite all these negative traits, however, Joffrey is shown to be capable of feeling emotion. On Robert's deathbed, he is visibly shocked and saddened at that his (legal) father may be dying and holds his hand, and (in the books) it is stated by various characters that Joffrey was very fond of Sandor Clegane despite his outwardly aloof manner towards him. He was probably more fond of the Hound because the man was a prolific and savage warrior, and had no complaints or restraints about killing, disregarding the fact that the Hound hated his even more savage brother, who was probably more aggressive and impractically violent than Joffrey himself, making him more interested in the Hound's combat prowess and aloofness (and Joffrey probably would have been terrified of the Mountain). He treated Margaery Tyrell much better than he did with Sansa Stark during their betrothal, although this is due to Margaery manipulating him by pretending to be intrigued by his playful sadism. On the other hand, he also acted charming and kind to Sansa, initially before turning her into his plaything to abuse and this one act was because his mother demanded him to do so, but he only became this way after her father confessed treason and her brother raised his armies against his claim. We will never know what their marriage would have been like as he died on the eve of their wedding feast.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joffrey_Baratheon"}}

Theon, for his part, at first tells them the simple truth (that he wanted to take and hold Winterfell while the North was vunerable to impress his father), then starts frantically lying (saying he hates the Starks for keeping him their \"prisoner\"), desperately trying to figure out what his captors want him to tell them. When the guards leave, they put a sack over his head. Ramsay Snow then approaches Theon disguised as a servant boy and unwinds the foot press, and tells him that he has been sent by his sister Yara to rescue him. However, he must wait until nightfall when the castle is asleep, so he puts the bag back on and the desperate Theon is left alone crying for help.\n\nRamsay later helps Theon escape and gives him a horse and tells him to ride east. Theon thanks him and says he'll make him a lord of the Iron Islands for this, but Ramsay says that they aren't in the Iron Islands now. Theon is later hunted down by his captors in a prolonged chase on horseback through the woods. Ultimately, his pursuers split into two groups and trap Theon between them, and he is knocked off his horse with a flail. Theon's captors pin him to the ground, and pull down his pants as the Master Torturer declares that he intends to rape Theon as punishment for trying to run away. However, Ramsay returns and snipes all of the captors from afar using his bow, rescuing him at the last minute. Realizing that Ramsay merely used him as a pawn for his great scheme to fool Theon, the Master Torturer's final words are \"you little bastard\" before Ramsay shoots him in the head.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Master_Torturer"}}

He is a young lord who still enjoys the life of a knight, including taking part in tourneys. He is visiting King's Landing when the series begins.\n\nUpon hearing of the atrocities committed by Ser Gregor Clegane, Lord Eddard Stark, acting as the Hand of the King, orders Lord Beric to take a hundred men, ride to Ser Gregor's keep and execute him for treason and murder. Beric willingly agrees to the task.\n\nLord Beric is rumored to have been killed in the Battle at the Mummer's Ford. The survivors form the Brotherhood Without Banners. In fact, Beric is actually killed by the Mountain, who drives a lance through his chest. Thoros of Myr unwittingly resurrects him.\n\nDondarrion reunites with Thoros' party at Hollow Hill, the headquarters of the Brotherhood Without Banners, and is surprised to see they have captured Sandor Clegane. Beric reveals he has converted to the religion of the Lord of Light. After Arya Stark accuses the Hound of murder, Beric sentences him to trial by combat as there is no other witness to confirm his guilt, and chooses himself as Clegane's rival. Using magic, Beric ignites his blade with fire, initially giving him an advantage during the fight due to Sandor's fear of fire. However, Sandor's superior strength eventually proves enough to overpower Beric, and with a powerful downward swipe Sandor cuts deep into Beric's shoulder, nearly cutting off his entire arm and cutting right through his flaming sword. Arya attempts to kill the Hound while he tries to extinguish his shield which had been set a flame during the fight, but she is stopped by Gendry. Sandor taunts Arya over how the gods prefer him over her friend, but he is interrupted and shocked by Beric, who has been revived and healed by Thoros using the Lord of Light's power. Since Sandor effectively won the fight, Beric declares him innocent and sets him free, but keeps Arya with the Brotherhood, intending to ransom her to her mother and brother at Riverrun.\n\nLater, Beric reminisces on the times he has been killed with Thoros and Arya. Arya briefly asks if Thoros can revive a man with no head, clearly referring to her father, but Beric merely compliments Eddard's honourable nature and tells her of the side effect of his resurrection: with each revival, he loses some of his memories and is less himself, a life he would not wish on Eddard. The group is later encountered by Melisandre, who seeks out Gendry. Melisandre briefly examines Beric and is clearly astonished at how Thoros has been able to revive him so many times. Against Arya's wishes, Beric sells Gendry to Melisandre for gold, a decision that later leads Arya to abandon them. When Beric informs Arya that they will be delaying ransoming her in order to launch an attack on some Lannister soldiers instead, it is the final straw and Arya flees from the group.\n\nArya Stark could not forgive Beric and Thoros for selling Gendry to Melisandre. Later, during her travels with Sandor Clegane, she includes their names when reciting her \"death list\".\n\nRemembering how Beric was revived by Thoros six times, Melisandre attempts a ritual to resurrect Jon Snow following his murder, which is successful.\n\nBeric prepares to hang Lem and two other members for raiding a community that was building a sept, staining the good name of the Brotherhood. However, Sandor Clegane, who had become a member of the community, hunts down Lem and demands he be allowed to kill the man himself, as vengeance for the hanging of Brother Ray. After some arguing, Beric and Thoros allow the Hound to hang two of the men himself, out of respect for the loss of his friend, but refused to allow him to kill them in a barbaric manner. Beric personally hangs the third man. Later on, Beric offers Sandor a place in the Brotherhood, as he needs good men. He says there are \"cold winds\" rising in the North, and he intends to stop them.\n\nThe Brotherhood Without Banners travel through thick snow. They decide to shelter for the night at an abandoned village but Sandor thinks it is unsafe. Beric Dondarrion dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter a hunt where they discover the corpses of the Farmer and his daughter Sally, Sandor and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior, following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n\nIn private, Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at King's Landing. Beric confides that he does not know what R'hllor, the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the father and his daughter and that Beric should be dead in their places.\n\nWhile making their way north, Beric, Sandor and Thoros are captured by Tormund and the wildlings manning Eastwatch-by-the-Sea south of the Wall. The three are brought to Eastwatch where they are incarcerated in the ice cells until they are accosted by Jon Snow, along with Jorah Mormont and Gendry. Despite initial distrust, particularly on Gendry's part, since Beric and Thoros sold him to Melisandre, Jon decides that they are on the same side, and he releases them. Beric, Thoros and Sandor join Jon, Gendry, Jorah and Tormund on their quest north of the Wall to help Jon capture a wight to bring to Cersei Lannister.\n\nWhile travelling beyond the Wall, Beric and Jon have a conversation. Beric claims that Jon does not look much like his father, which takes Jon by surprise. Beric reveals that it was Eddard Stark who sent him and Thoros to hunt the Mountain. Revealing that he heard from Tormund that Melisandre brought Jon back from the dead, Beric tells Jon that Thoros brought him back six times by now. Beric claims that both of them serve the Lord of Light. Jon replies that he serves the North and that the Lord of Light never spoke to him. When Jon claims that he does not know what the Lord of Light wants of him, Beric replies that the Lord wants both of them alive so that they can fight for life itself. Beric states that death is the enemy and that, although the enemy always wins, they still need to fight him.\n\nWhen a snowstorm sets in, the group is suddenly ambushed by a wight polar bear. Beric and Throros ignite their swords to fend off the undead beast and although the team is able to defeat the beast in combined effort, Thoros is mauled and gravely wounded by the bear. After the bear has been destroyed, Beric stops Thoros' bleeding by cauterising the wound with his flaming sword.\n\nFurther north, the group eventually encounters a White Walker accompanied by a small group of Wights. The team ambushes the Walker and the wights and after Jon kills the Walker, all but one wight smash to the ground motionless. The team captures the wight but they are soon forced to flee when the full force of the undead army comes down onto them. They flee to an island on top of a frozen lake, which grants them temporary safety as the wights break through the ice and are unable to cross. Surrounded by wights, the group is forced to wait out the night in the cold. As Jon has sent Gendry back to Eastwatch to send a letter to Daenerys Targaryen, Daenerys is the group's last hope to flee the North alive. An entire night passes and the next morning, the group realizes that Thoros has frozen to death. Mourning his deceased friend, Beric says a prayer for Thoros before he ignites his corpse with his sword so that he cannot reanimate as a wight.\n\nAfter burning Thoros, Beric joins Jorah and Jon who are discussing that Daenerys is their only hope. Beric claims that there is another and points at the Night King, who is watching the trapped group from a nearby hill. Beric states that the Night King is the one who turned them all and thus, killing the Night King would annihilate the army of the dead in one swift stroke. Beric tells Jon that this might be the purpose the Lord of Light has for them, as he hardly brought them back only to watch them freeze. Sandor then chips in, reminding Beric that he lost his priest and is thus on his \"last life\".\n\nEventually, the water freezes again and the wights advance onto the island. The group prepares for their last stand and Beric once more ignites his sword, killing many wights. When it comes to battle, the sheer masses of the advancing undead force the group further back onto the island. When all hope seems lost, Daenerys suddenly sweeps in with her three dragons Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal. While the younger two dragons annihilate the advancing undead, Daenerys lands Drogon on the island so that the men can climb up onto the dragon. All but Jon, who is still fending off wights, make it onto the dragon where they witness the Night King hurling an ice spear at the flying Viserion, impaling him through the neck and causing the dying dragon to fall onto the ground, break through the ice and sink to the ground of the lake. All onboard the dragon, Beric included, watch in awe and horror. As the Night King is already preparing another projectile, Drogon is forced to set off and the group, except for Jon, fly back to the Wall.\n\nHaving returned to Eastwatch safely, Beric, Tormund and Sandor deliver the wight. After having hurled the wight into the boat, Beric and Sandor split up as their travel together has come to an end. Beric claims that they will meet again, to which Sandor replies that he \"fucking hope[s] not\".\n\nWhile most of the group make their way down south to meet Queen Cersei, Beric remains at Eastwatch together with Tormund and his wildlings. While both men stand on top of the Wall facing north, they suddenly witness the arrival of the White Walkers and the army of the dead. While they are watching in awe, the Night King suddenly comes swooping in on top of the reanimated Viserion. Viserion blasts blue fire at the wall, causing outer shells to crack off. Beric and Tormund run to escape while Viserion continuously breathes fire onto the Wall, eventually bringing down a large part of it and allowing the dead to enter the Seven Kingdoms. Whether Beric survives these events is currently unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Beric_Dondarrion"}}

While Josera believed that their father sent them away out of shame, Elsera believed that it was in fact the contrary, that their father sent his bastards away to protect them and their gifts.\n\nAs they approach the North Grove, Gared, Cotter, and Sylvi are attacked by Josera's snow bear, Shadow. They manage to fend it off long enough to reach the grove, where Elsera forces him to stop attacking the group. The three newcomers are held at knifepoint, until Gared reveals that he was sent by House Forrester. Josera disbelieves his claim, even after he presents proof, but Elsera urges her brother to trust the squire. The two give their names, and Gared then reveals that he came to the North Grove because of Gregor's last words him. Gregor's bastards are shocked to learn of their father's death, and while Josera is angered that Gared doesn't know their identity, Elsera managed to calm him. Before they have time to talk further, the group learns of wights approaching the grove and move to defend it. The siblings has Sylvi tied up, but Gared can convince them to free her. They then move to confront the threat.  While going to fight the wights, Elsera reveals to Gared that she and Josera are the bastard children of Gregor. Josera believes Gregor banished them to hide his shame but Elsera doesn't share his bitterness toward their late father. Upon arriving at a clearing, Elsera performs magic, cutting her hand and throwing her blood into a fire, sending some of her strange warriors to take positions. The wights attacks but the group comes out victorious. After the fight Gared and Josera approached Elsera who was weak due to the toll of the magic. One of Elsera's soldiers then stops obeying her orders, and attacks her. Josera moves to kill it, but Elsera manages to get it under control. Josera tells Gared that she controls the soldiers through blood magic, and that her power over them is growing weaker. Now aware of Gregor's death and the peril House Forrester faces, Josera expresses a desire to abandon the North Grove and march south to help his family. \n\nBack in the Grove, Elsera invites Gared to join her because she has something to show him. Following the woman to a ceremony room, Gared discovered an agonizing Cotter laying there. Elsera told Gared that she had done everything she could but that it was to late to save him. Elsera then let Gared choose Cotter's fate, to give him the nightshade to end his suffering or to help her rip his beating heart during a ritual to harness the power of the Grove. If Gared chooses to euthanize Cotter, one of Elsera's soldier will attack her and she will be forced to kill her.  After the burning of Cotter's body, Josera reiterated his desire to go south to help the Forresters. Gared was then given the choice to agree with Elsera and stay to defend the North Grove or to travel back to the Seven Kingdoms.

Those who sell their sexual services are more commonly known simply as whores.

Organized religion does discourage prostitution, and it is socially frowned upon, but it is nonetheless present, sometimes seen as an outlet for \"uncontrollable male sexual desires\". Secular lords and kings have not (in general) tried to shut down prostitution, as taxing brothels is a good source of revenue.\n\nDespite their vows of celibacy, some of the officers of the Night's Watch have been known to frequent a brothel in Mole's Town, a village in the Gift which is the settlement of commoners (i.e. including women, and prostitutes) located closest to the Wall.\n\nApparently, a common euphemistic name applied to prostitutes in Westeros is \"Sallys\". When Catelyn Stark is led into the brothel owned by Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish, she shouts in anger that he should be ashamed to bring a noblewoman into such a place, as if she were some \"back-alley Sally\" (though he actually brought her to his brothel because no one would think to look for her there). When Samwell Tarly is complaining to Jon Snow that several officers in the Night's Watch secretly frequent the brothel in Mole's Town, he says it isn't fair that they swear oaths of celibacy but then flout their vows by sneaking off to enjoy a \"Sally on the side\".\n\nA number of prostitutes work at Littlefinger's brothel in King's Landing, owned by Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish:\n\nAt Littlefinger's brothel at any point from Season 1 to Season 3:\n\nnull\n\nAt Littlefinger's brothel from Seasons 3 to Season 5:\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nWorking at the brothel in Mole's Town in the Gift:\n\nnull\n\nOther prostitutes and camp followers in Westeros:\n\nnull\n\nProstitution is commonly practiced in many regions of the continent of Essos, such as in the Free Cities. The Free City of Lys is famous for training some of the best bed-slaves and prostitutes in the world. Irogenia of Lys was a world-famous courtesan.\n\nSlavery is illegal in Westeros, but it is legal in many regions of Essos. Thus prostitutes in Westeros are never legally considered to be actual \"slaves\", even if they are functionally living in conditions of dire social and economic servitude not much better than slaves. In contrast, many prostitutes in the Free Cities are actual slaves, whose services are rented out by their masters. Not all bed-slaves are necessarily prostitutes, however, though only in the sense that their masters don't let other people have sex with them for money, instead retaining private access to their sexual use. The city of Yunkai in Slaver's Bay focuses on producing bed-slaves, though they aren't as highly esteemed as those trained in Lys.\n\nIn Braavos\n\nnull\n\nIn Lys\n\nnull\n\nIn Volantis\n\nnull\n\nIn Slaver's Bay\n\nnull\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, prostitution is practiced throughout the continents of Westeros and Essos. It is tacitly legal in the Seven Kingdoms, as kings and lords usually find it more profitable to simply tax brothels than to ban prostitution outright. Every now and again a particularly pious lord will attempt to shut down the brothels within his lands, but with varying degrees of success. King Baelor Targaryen - a deeply religious but delusional, half-insane pacifist - drove all of the prostitutes out of King's Landing, but after he died they soon came back. Of course, this was just one instance in a long string of King Baelor's follies, such as trying to have all of the messenger-ravens in Westeros replaced with doves, wearing a crown made of flowers, and appointing an eight year old boy as High Septon. For that matter, Baelor never even consummated his own marriage and therefore died without issue, so the crown had to pass to his uncle.\n\nIn the books, Littlefinger does maintain a high-end brothel in King's Landing, though many of the named prostitutes shown working there in the TV series have no specific counterparts in the books. Mhaegen, the prostitute who has a bastard daughter with King Robert, is present in the books: however in the novels she is killed when she tries to defend her daughter from the Gold Cloaks; this wasn't explicitly shown in the TV series, so her survival is unclear. Marei also appears in the books but she is employed by Chataya, not Littlefinger. Littlefinger considers prostitution as a very profitable business. He told Eddard Stark: \"Brothels are a much sounder investment than ships, I've found. Whores seldom sink, and when they are boarded by pirates, why, they pay good coin like everyone else\".\n\nStannis Baratheon objects to prostitution. He tried once to persuade Robert to outlaw brothels, but Robert (whose main hobby was whoring) asked him mockingly if perhaps he'd like to outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing as well.\n\nOtherwise, the TV series created a new prostitute character named Ros, who stands in for or acts as a condensation of several different prostitutes in the books. Originally the role was just a one-time guest spot as a \"red-haired whore\" in the pilot episode, but the producers were impressed enough by Esme Bianco's performance that they turned it into a recurring role; eventually they used Ros as a stand-in for other prostitute characters, to work with someone the audience is already familiar with instead of frequently introducing new characters.\n\nIn the books, there is another upscale brothel in King's Landing, owned and run by a madam from the Summer Islands named Chataya, whose own daughter Alayaya works at her establishment. In the books, it was Alayaya whom Cersei Lannister mistakenly captured, thinking she was Tyrion's lover (who was actually Shae); rather than expand an already massive cast of characters, Ros stood in for Alayaya's role in the TV series.\n\nThe books often mention \"camp-followers\": whores who regularly follow armies and sellsword companies. In addition to sleeping with soldiers, sometimes they perform chores like cooking and washing clothes for the soldiers. Shae was a camp-follower before she became Tyrion's mistress.\n\nThe Free City of Braavos is one of the few exceptional areas in Essos where slavery is illegal (as it was founded by slaves fleeing the old Valyrian Freehold centuries ago). Even so, Braavos has \"free\" prostitutes much as Westeros does, which come in three general categories: high-class courtesans, brothel-workers, and lowly street-walkers. The courtesans of Braavos are actually world-renowned for their sophistication, well-respected for their skills, and treated as celebrities. Braavos is a city of canals and boat-houses, and many of the most famous Braavosi courtesans own their own boats and answer to no one. Braavosi courtesans aren't necessarily as skilled in actual sex-acts as are the bed-slaves of Lys, however their areas of expertise encompass a far wider range of cultural education in music, poetry, literature, etc. (similar to real-life Japanese geisha).\n\nProstitution, of course, existed in the real-life Middle Ages and throughout history. It has earned the euphemistic title \"The World's Oldest Profession\" due to how far back in history its practice can be traced. In medieval Europe, men were rarely outright criticized for visiting prostitutes, because no one - or rather, the men who controlled society and wrote the historical records - thought that the male sex drive was something which could be controlled. Men were never blamed for being unable to restrain themselves, and indeed, prostitution was often seen as a convenient release mechanism for such pent-up desires.\n\nA major point which might be overlooked, both in Game of Thrones and in the real-life Middle Ages, is that most prostitutes didn't want to be prostitutes. Typically, they were desperate women on the fringes of society that had no other alternative and turned to prostitution as a last resort. Prostitutes were rarely well-paid courtesans happily working in high-class brothels like Ros in Season 1 - more often they were like Fantine in Les Misérables. Statistically, most prostitutes in the Middle Ages were \"adrift\" women who had no recorded family members - no support network to fall back onto, so prostitution was their only remaining alternative.\n\nTo use the categorization scheme mentioned from Braavos, at the top of the spectrum are high-class courtesans, in the middle are brothel-whores, and at the bottom are street walkers dangerously wandering the back alleys at night. The problem is that in real-life, historical records which survive tend to skew the evidence towards more high-class prostitutes who interacted with the nobility - the nobles produced most if not all of the written records, thus surviving descriptions of \"prostitutes\" tend to be of the \"high class courtesan\" type of prostitute, not the \"miserable starving street-walker\" type. A small handful may have become relatively comfortable as high-class courtesans, but this too often leads to the misguided belief that prostitutes were happy \"sex workers\". The overwhelming majority were desperate women with no support structure utterly on the fringes of society, to the point that their suffering went unrecorded.\n\nSimilarly, in the TV series, the narrative tends to focus more on high-born characters from the nobility: when Tyrion visits a brothel he interacts with high-end \"courtesans\", because as a member of the nobility he can afford to go to the best brothels. Chataya, a woman from the Summer Islands, is a madam who even owns her own high-end brothel in King's Landing (separate from Littlefinger's). Unfortunately, this might skew the perception that most \"prostitutes\" as a whole throughout the entire realm are living comfortably and happily - but this is only a small, disproportionate fraction of all \"prostitutes\" throughout Westeros. While a few Sexposition scenes might portray the lives of prostitutes as exciting, indeed sexually liberating for women, keep in mind that most prostitutes were living in desperate conditions and didn't want to be prostitutes. Even Ros, who for a time enjoys a fairly comfortable existence in Littlefinger's high-class brothel, is in the end slaughtered like cattle at Joffrey's sadistic whim, and without repercussions.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Prostitution"}}

Under the guise of a three-eyed raven, he appears in Bran Stark's vision-dreams, following his fall and injury, prompting his quest beyond the Wall and guiding him to the cave in which his real human body resides. There, Bran is trained in the magic of Greensight by the three-eyed raven.","When Bran finally meets him in the cave beyond the Wall, the three-eyed crow is revealed to be a pale, skeletal man in rotted black clothing in a weirwood throne of tangled roots. His skin is white, aside from a red blotch on his neck and cheek. He has fine, white hair long enough to reach the earthen floor. He is missing one eye, while the other is red. Weirwood roots surround the man and grow through his body, including his leg and his empty eye socket. His voice is slow and dry, as if he had forgotten how to speak.

In them, it appears as Bran is about to fire an arrow and causes him to stop before he shoots. Then, the raven lands on the head of a direwolf statue, cries once and then flies deep into the Stark family crypt. After having the dream again, he becomes convinced the raven is guiding him to the crypts in order to somehow find his father there, even though he is supposed to be alive and well at King's Landing. Anxious to find out, he asks Osha to take him down to the crypts. There, they are surprised by Rickon, who admits to having had the same dreams. Outside, Osha is still trying to tell Bran that it could be a coincidence when a saddened Maester Luwin appears, holding a letter announcing Eddard's death.\n\nBran asks Osha about the significance of the three-eyed raven but she does not divulge anything.\n\nWhile traveling north, Bran dreams once again of the three-eyed raven. In the dream he's able to walk and attempts to shoot at him with a bow and arrow. A strange boy then appears in the dream, and tells Bran that he cannot kill the raven, because Bran is the raven. Another day, this same boy, Jojen, and his sister Meera encounter Bran and his companions in real life, and Jojen explains the prophetic powers of greensight dreams to Bran. Jojen explains that he also saw the three-eyed raven and it was Jojen himself in the dream (not just a prophetic vision of him), as the power of greensight, conferred by the raven, allowed his mind to enter Bran's dreams.\n\nWhen Bran touches a weirwood in the haunted forests beyond The Wall, he sees flashes of the three-eyed raven from his dreams at Winterfell, flying through the crypts. Among his other vision is a single giant weirwood on a hill, with a voice that whispers, \"Look for me... beneath the tree... North!\". Bran and his group eventually reach the giant weirwood tree on the hill, but are attacked by a group of wights. Jojen is fatally stabbed and Meera attempts to save him, but Jojen tells her to leave him for dead. They are helped by a child of the forest, who leads them into a cave. She explains that the wights cannot enter, as the magic that reanimates them has no power there. She then leads them deep into the cave to the three-eyed raven, who is revealed to not be a bird but a very old man whose body is fused to the roots of the weirwood tree. Bran states that he is the three-eyed raven, and the man tells them that he has been many things but is now what they see. Meera begins to tell him that Jojen has died and before she can finish the raven says that Jojen knew what would happen the moment he left, and went anyway. When Meera asks how he knows that, the raven says that he has been watching them for all of their lives with a thousand eyes and one. The raven tells Bran that the hour is late, and Bran replies that he did not want anyone to die for him. The raven states that Jojen died so that Bran could find what he lost. Bran asks if the raven will help him walk again. The raven answers that Bran will never walk again, but he will fly.\n\nThe three-eyed raven monitors Bran as he experiences a vision of Winterfell during the childhood of Lyanna and Ned Stark that reveals Hodor's true name, Wylis. He tells Bran that it is time to go, but when Bran expresses a desire to remain in the happy memories, the three-eyed raven pulls him out of the vision. He warns Bran to resist the urge to only view those happy times, and reminds him that as powerful as Greensight is, the past is still the past, and cannot be changed.\n\nThe three-eyed raven is with Bran when Bran is viewing the events that occurred at the Tower of Joy at the end of Robert's Rebellion. He identifies young Ned's second-in-command as Howland Reed, Meera's father, and also confirms that Ser Arthur Dayne is a better swordsman than Ned is, explaining to a confused Bran that there is a difference between history and what actually happened.\n\nBran calls out to his future father in desperation \u2013 to his shock, Ned seems to hear him, but dismisses it and continues into the Tower. The three-eyed raven pulls Bran out of the vision, and reprimands him again for trying to interact with the past. The three-eyed raven says he's waited a thousand years for Bran, as the weirwood roots have grown into him. He assures Bran that he [Bran] is not destined to share his fate, but warns that he must learn before he leaves. When Bran demands to know what it is he needs to learn, the three-eyed raven declares, \"everything\".\n\nEventually, he and Leaf decide that Bran is ready to learn the truth about the White Walkers. The three-eyed raven accompanies Bran into a vision of the distant past, thousands of years ago, during the war between the Children and the First Men, in which they witness a group of Children led by Leaf approach a captured man, and magically insert a shard of Dragonglass into his heart, which transforms him into the first of the White Walkers. Awakening, Bran realizes that the White Walkers were created by the Children to use as weapons against his ancestors.\n\nLater, whilst the three-eyed raven and Bran's companions are resting, Bran interacts with one of the weirwood roots, triggering a vision in which he witnesses a large army of Wights, idly standing in the frozen wastes of the Land of Always Winter. Wading into their midst, Bran stares incredulously at the creatures, ultimately finding himself standing before the Night King himself, and three of his Lieutenants. Unlike the Wights, however, the Walkers take note of their guest. The Night King meets Bran's gaze, and materializes beside him, grabbing hold of his arm. Awakening in terror, the three-eyed raven reveals to him that the Night King has marked him; he knows where he is, and will come for him. The mark likewise neutralizes the magic wards around the cave which bar the Walkers and their minions from entering. The three-eyed raven tells him that he and his companions must leave.\n\nWhile Meera and Hodor pack their belongings and the children prepare the cave's defenses, the three-eyed raven takes Bran into the past one final time, again to his father's childhood at Winterfell, this time witnessing the young Eddard departing for The Vale, as the castle's citizens look on, including Wylis and Old Nan. Soon, the Night King and his three Lieutenants arrive with an army of Wights to launch their attack on the cave. Though Leaf and the Children attempt to hold them off, their attempts are in vain, as the Walkers and their Wights breach the cave. Still within the vision, the three-eyed raven remains motionless in the roots as the defenders are slaughtered, and Bran, Meera, Hodor, and Leaf make their escape through the back of the cave.\n\nFollowing their flight, the Night King and his two remaining White Walkers enter the three-eyed raven's chamber, and the Night King slowly approaches him. Within the vision, the three-eyed raven tells Bran that the time has come for him to leave. With that, the Night King swiftly executes him, carving him diagonally across the torso with his blade, as the three-eyed raven breaks apart and turns to dust within the vision, leaving Bran alone.\n\nAs Bran and Meera were escaping from the wight, a hooded Benjen Stark came and rescued them. When Meera asked Benjen why he rescued them, he answered the Three-Eyed Raven requested him. When Meera said the Three-Eyed Raven is dead, Benjen answered \"He lives again.\" It is a possibility, regarding this answer, that 'Three-Eyed Raven' wasn't a name as first assumed but rather a title used by previous Greenseers before the present time.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Three-eyed_raven"}}

He is the father of Ser Robar Royce, who served in the Kingsguard of King Renly I Baratheon, and Ser Waymar Royce, a ranger in the Night's Watch who was one of the first brothers of the Night's Watch to be killed by a White Walker upon their return.\n\nWhen Eddard Stark was a ward to Lord Jon Arryn and lived at the Eyrie in his youth, he and Yohn Royce became close friends hunted together many times.\n\nWhile escorting his son Waymar to the Wall, Yohn Royce visited Winterfell.\n\nYohn Royce is present in the tribunal, hearing the testimony of Lord Petyr Baelish about the death of Lysa Arryn. Along with Lady Anya Waynwood and Ser Vance Corbray, he assumes foul play on Littlefinger's part. He openly expresses his dislike of Littlefinger, calling him a whoremonger, money-grubber, and liar, as well as pointing out his tendency to suck up to Tywin Lannister in the past. The tribunal then summons Littlefinger's niece, \"Alayne\", the only other witness. Lord Yohn is surprised to learn of Alayne's true identity - Sansa Stark. Satisfied with her testimony, Royce and Waynwood discuss the Vale's next move with Baelish. He suggests that it is long past time that Robin left the Eyrie and conducted an official tour of the Vale.\n\nRoyce agreed with Petyr Baelish to foster Lord Robin Arryn at Runestone, although he is not impressed with the skills of the young lord.\n\nRoyce oversees Robin Arryn's archery training, watching in contempt as Robin fails to hit the marks. The training is interrupted when Baelish arrives by carriage. Royce is outraged as Baelish told him that he and Sansa Stark would return to the Fingers, yet Sansa was married to Ramsay Bolton at Winterfell. Baelish uses the opportunity, falsely claiming that on the way to the Fingers they were attacked by a vast Bolton host which seemed to have inside knowledge of Baelish's travel plans. Baelish reveals that Royce was the only one he told about his route and begins casting aspersions on his loyalty, asking Robin how to fare with him. Although Robin at first plans to throw Royce out of the Moon Door, Baelish advises him to spare Royce because of his loyalty to House Arryn. With the dark realization that Robin is under Baelish's control, Royce pleads with Robin for another chance, and Robin agrees. Royce is named commander of the armies of the Vale and told to round up the Vale's soldiers in order to march North and save Sansa from Ramsay.\n\nThe Vale reinforcements win a crushing victory against the Bolton infantry, slaughtering the phalanx surrounding the depleted Stark forces and allowing Jon Snow to liberate Winterfell with a wildling force. Lord Royce later voices to Jon his disgust at the knights of the Vale allying themselves with \"wildling invaders\". Tormund Giantsbane explains that they were invited, but Lord Royce responds that he was not the one who invited them. He later watches on as Lady Lyanna Mormont, Lord Wyman Manderly, and Lord Robett Glover proclaim their allegiance to Jon Snow as the new King in the North, and declares allegiance to the new King in the North alongside the other lords of the Vale.\n\nRoyce is present at King Snow's meeting regarding plans against the White Walkers' impending invasion. He opines that Last Hearth and Karhold ought to be totally demolished in retribution for House Karstark and House Umber's treason against House Stark. However, Sansa and Jon disagree with this and Jon ultimately allows Ned Umber and Alys Karstark to retain their ancestral homes after renewing their pledge of loyalty.\n\nRoyce speaks out against Jon's plan to treat with Daenerys Targaryen, on the basis that \"a Targaryen cannot be trusted\" unaware of Jon's own true parentage.\n\nYohn is ordered by Sansa to see that the armor made for their armies are outfitted with leather to keep warm.\n\nLater, Lord Royce joins Lord Robett Glover in calling for Regent Sansa to take over from her half-brother Jon Snow as ruler of the North. Sansa rejects their petition and insists that Jon is their true ruler and that she is only a regent. Arya Stark suggests that Sansa assassinate the troublesome lords but Sansa rejects the idea as repugnant. Lord Royce is later present at what is ostensibly a drumhead trial for Arya Stark. Royce is clearly not surprised or displeased that the trial turns out to be Littlefinger's instead. Sansa confronts Littlefinger with his many crimes against the Starks, Arryns, Tullys, and many others who have suffered from the massive wars he kicked off. When Petyr demands that Yohn escort him back to the Eyrie, Lord Yohn scornfully refuses, signaling that he no longer recognizes his authority. He later watches impassionately as Lord Baelish is executed by Arya Stark, ending Littlefinger's machinations once and for all.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yohn_Royce"}}

When Daenerys asks what will happen then, Jorah responds that he once saw a man last nine miles being dragged behind a horse.\n\nJorah tells Daenerys that King Robert Baratheon will never stop; he wants her and her child dead. Drogo enters the tent in a fury. He glares at the wineseller, making him whimper in fear, and asks Daenerys if she is alright. Drogo kisses her head and strokes her belly, he then tells Jorah that he may choose any horse as his reward, and that it is Drogo's gift to him. And for his unborn heir he also has a gift; he will take his men and will travel across the sea and take the iron chair that his mother's father sat in.\n\nWhen we next see the wineseller, he is naked and bound with a rope around his hands, the other end of which is tied to the saddle of Daenerys's horse when the khalasar rides to Lhazar. He presumably dies during the journey.\n\nDaenerys later discovers that Jorah had in fact been spying on her for Robert Baratheon before switching his allegiance to her, prompting an angry interrogation where he admits to informing King Robert of her pregnancy. Daenerys quickly realizes that the wineseller tried to poison her because of his information. Jorah defensively reminds Daenerys that he stopped her from drinking his wine but she retorts that was because he knew it had to be poisoned. As a punishment, she exiles Jorah from Meereen.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Wineseller"}}

When she first appears in the Prologue of the second novel, Maester Cressen thinks to himself that the castle staff have only recently begun referring to her as \"princess\" - ever since Stannis declared himself king as Robert's lawful heir. He notes, however, that everyone, including Shireen, picked up the new title very quickly."],"name":"Shireen Baratheon","description":"Shireen is the daughter of Stannis and Selyse Baratheon. Her father is the head of House Baratheon of Dragonstone and has declared himself King on the Iron Throne. Shireen is Stannis's only living child and therefore his heir presumptive. She is the same age as Arya Stark. She had three older brothers, who were stillborn.\n\nThe left side of her face is scarred by Greyscale, which she caught as an infant. Normally considered a death sentence, Stannis refused to give up on her and called in every healer he could find from both sides of the Narrow Sea to try to cure her, and through the combination of their efforts they managed to succeed, though the left side of her face was left permanently scarred.\n\nSelyse resents Shireen because she could not give Stannis a healthy son, only a sickly daughter, and dismisses her as stubborn and sinful. Shireen in turn tries to avoid her mother, because she is frightened by Selyse's fanatical devotion to Melisandre and the Lord of Light. However, Shireen adores her father and he loves her deeply as well, though he is a dour man who doesn't often let it show through his stern exterior. She is also close friends with Stannis's most trusted advisor, Ser Davos Seaworth, who loves her like his own daughter.\n\nHaving ignored Selyse and Shireen for several months, Stannis pays them a visit sometime after Melisandre's departure from Dragonstone to gather power on the mainland. Selyse tries to dissuade Stannis from seeing Shireen, but he angrily insists upon seeing his daughter. While telling her of the disaster at Blackwater Bay, Shireen asks for Davos Seaworth, calling him by his traditional soubriquet, \"The Onion Knight\". Stannis gently explains that he is a traitor and is in the dungeon, a notion which distresses the young princess. Advising her to forget her friend, Stannis departs.\n\nLater that night, Shireen sneaks out of her tower and into the dungeon to see Davos. She demonstrates knowledge of the guards and their habits, making sure to visit when the gaoler, a known drunk, is on duty. Shireen brings Davos a book about Aegon the Conqueror to pass the time, but the Onion Knight admits he cannot read. Shireen takes this in stride and begins to teach him through the bars of his cell.\n\nFollowing Ser Davos's release, he spends time with Shireen. She implores him to read more of Aegon's exploits rather than sort through Stannis's correspondence, which consists mostly of invitations to attend social events thrown by his few remaining bannermen, including the nameday celebration of one of Shireen's Florent cousins. When a confused Davos asks why there is a \"G\" in the word \"night\", Shireen shrugs off the unusual spelling. Davos's newfound knowledge is what ultimately leads to Stannis deciding to head to the Wall to aid the Night's Watch against Mance Rayder.\n\nSelyse fears for Shireen's soul, saying that she is stubborn, sinful and sullen. She expresses a desire to strike her with a rod, which Stannis forbids. Selyse suggests that Melisandre speak to Shireen. Melisandre goes to visit her and Shireen makes clear her disapproval of Melisandre burning people, including her uncle Ser Axell Florent. Melisandre tells her that the tales told in the Seven-Pointed Star are lies and fables and that the only true gods are R'hllor and the Great Other, with the only hell being the one they live in now.\n\nLater, Shireen continues her reading lessons with Ser Davos in her chambers, where he joins her after a tense meeting with her father. She scolds him for being late, and insists that he won't make a very good Hand of the King if he sees the word \"knight\" and says \"ka-nigit\". He says that she certainly is her father's daughter, as they are both relentless. She gives him a new book which she says is more complex, The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas, First Sword of Braavos. She chides him for moving his lips when he reads because that's how children do it, then claps her hands in congratulations when he reads the title correctly. Shireen says she enjoys this book because it is filled with pirates and swordfights.\n\nDavos explains that he has been to Braavos, during his smuggling days, but he nearly lost his life when he ran afoul of the First Sword who was protecting the ships of the Iron Bank of Braavos. Davos says that's to be expected, though, given that the ships of the Iron Bank transport a nation's worth of gold - at which point realization suddenly dawns on him. Davos kisses Shireen on the forehead for having helped him figure it out and asks her to write a letter to the Iron Bank. She protests that he really should because it is good practice, but says that it is very important, so he must make sure that it is written properly by someone smart. He proceeds to dictate a letter requesting for an audience with the Iron Bank, to ask them to switch their support from the Lannisters to her father. He has her address the letter as if she was actually her father, and she asks if they should do that: Davos says it is fine (given that he is Stannis's Hand) and that addressing the letter as \"from King Stannis\" is just to get the Bank's attention. Shireen accompanies Stannis to the North in his defense of the Night's Watch against the wildlings. She and her mother are present in Castle Black at the Watch's subsequent funeral for their fallen brothers.\n\nShireen, alongside her mother, is present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee. While her mother looks pleased, Shireen is horrified and closes her eyes when Mance starts to burn.\n\nSince Gilly is illiterate, Shireen begins to teach her letters with Samwell Tarly watching the two. Shireen also tells the two of them how she contracted Greyscale when she was little and survived. Gilly and Sam leave when Shireen's mother enters and begins to scold her about fraternizing with a wildling girl. Shireen tries to defend Gilly, but Selyse criticizes her for being naive despite all the knowledge she has gained from her books.\n\nShireen watches Jon Snow spar with new recruits in the courtyard of Castle Black. Later, she visits her father in his chambers. Stannis asks his daughter if she is lonely, but Shireen is simply bored. He knows that Castle Black is not a place for a child, but Shireen is glad to be there since she believed that she would be left behind at Dragonstone. Finally, Shireen asks her father if he is ashamed of her. The question surprises Stannis, but he responds by telling Shireen the story of how she contracted greyscale from a doll he bought from a Dornish merchant. She snuggled with the doll in her crib, putting the left side of her face on it. Although he was counseled to send her to the ruins of Valyria to live out her short life with the Stone Men, Stannis refused and called every maester, apothecary, and healer he could find to save his daughter's life. Overjoyed, Shireen embraces her father and he returns the embrace.\n\nWhen Stannis and his army leave Castle Black for Winterfell, he takes Shireen and Selyse with him, not wanting them in the company of the Night's Watch, due to many of them being criminals and rapists. As they depart, Shireen tells Davos that she wants to see the crypt of Winterfell where all the old kings of the North are buried, to which Davos replies that they must first take the castle from the Boltons. Shireen asks him if there is going to be a battle, and he affirms that she won't be anywhere near it. Selyse approaches them and commands Davos to stop speaking of battles and scaring the child. Shireen claims that she is unafraid, and promises to protect him. Shireen rides from Castle Black along with the Baratheon army.\n\nDuring the march the weather turns for the worse and a snow storm delays Stannis's army. Melisandre reminds Stannis that they may need to sacrifice more King's blood in order to better their chances of winning the upcoming battle in the snow which they both saw in the flames, citing the deaths of Robb Stark and Joffrey as examples. When Stannis says that they have no chance of locating Gendry, Melisandre suggests that they sacrifice Shireen. Stannis is visibly shocked and repulsed by the suggestion, asking her if she has lost her mind. She tries to convince him but he rebuffs her and orders her to leave his presence.\n\nThings get worse for Stannis and his army when Ramsay, along with twenty other Bolton soldiers, sneak in and destroy the food tents and kill some of the horses. The desperate nature of Stannis' position suddenly becomes clear. Before Davos is sent away to the wall to retrieve more supplies and men, the Onion Knight visits Shireen in her tent and presents her with a beautifully carved stag. Grateful of his gift, Shireen thanks Davos and sends him off with a heartfelt goodbye. Stannis later visits Shireen and the two discuss the events that unfolded between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her brother Aegon during the Dance of the Dragons. Stannis tells her if a man knows what he is and remains true to his self that he must fulfill his destiny no matter how much he hates it. Shireen, being the loving daughter she is, expresses to him that she wants to help and will do whatever she can to help her father -- without knowing his true intentions. As Shireen embraces her father, Stannis asks for her forgiveness.\n\nLater on Shireen is escorted and tied to a pyre where she is sacrificed to the Lord of Light by Melisandre, who does so without remorse. As she burns she pleads for her mother and father to help her. Selyse runs to her daughter's aid, but is held back by Baratheon soldiers, and crumples to the ground as she watches her daughter die in the flames and Stannis looking away with tears in his eyes.\n\nShireen's sacrifice allows her father's army to press forwards as the blood magic appears to have been successful in melting the snows. However, the horror of a little girl's sacrifice has led hundreds of Baratheon troops and all his sellswords (about half his army) to desert, while Selyse hangs herself, and Melisandre flees after hearing the news. Stannis nevertheless presses forward to Winterfell but his army is defeated by the Boltons. Stannis is later killed by a vengeful Brienne of Tarth, his spirit broken by defeat and the needless sacrifice that was far too dear.\n\nJon Snow and Davos Seaworth later learn of Shireen's death when Melisandre returns to Castle Black, although she withholds the specific details, including the role that she herself and Stannis played in it.\n\nSer Davos walks not far from Jon Snow's camp the day before the Battle of the Bastards. As the sun starts to rise, he comes across the remnants of a pyre where he finds the wooden stag he carved for Shireen, burned but mostly whole, leading him to discover that Melisandre burned Shireen as a sacrifice. He pockets it and holds onto it throughout the ensuing battle, and observes Melisandre with anger in the aftermath, while still holding the stag.\n\nIn Winterfell, Davos confronts Melisandre in front of Jon. He tosses the burned stag carving at her, accuses her of murder, and demands he be allowed to execute her. Melisandre admits that she burned Shireen, but defends herself by saying it was the only way for them to escape the snowstorms and that Stannis and Selyse agreed to the measure. Though visibly horrified after learning what truly happened to Shireen, Jon does not execute Melisandre, but banishes her from the North, declaring that she will be hanged as a murderer if she ever returns, while Davos, admitting that he loved Shireen like a daughter, warns Melisandre that he will be the one to personally hang her.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Shireen_Baratheon"}}

But as time passes and Mance is killed on the orders of Stannis Baratheon, he believes the prophesied warrior is his enemy-turned-friend Jon Snow.","Tormund is older in the books than in the TV series: he is described as having a white beard so he is not a young man, but he is also described as large, broad, and still very strong.

Tormund likes to brag about his deeds, but he is not arrogant."],"name":"Tormund","description":"Tormund is a trusted leader in his own right of a large warband of wildlings. He has joined his forces to those of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder, and now functions as one of Mance's most trusted lieutenants. Tormund is not just a capable leader, but also a very dangerous fighter. This is proven during the Battle of Castle Black, where he killed multiple Night's Watch brothers and clearly outmatched Ser Alliser Thorne in single combat.\n\nHe boasts of having bedded a she-bear, which he calls Shella. Ygritte insists that everyone knows he just made this story up. Tormund makes much of his capacity for drink and sexual encounters, usually as a means of raising his allies' morale. He is extremely loyal to those who have fought alongside him, even Jon Snow, who once betrayed him and the wildlings.\n\nTormund has two daughters, though he hasn't mentioned if he has any sons.\n\nWhen Jon Snow is taken to Mance Rayder's tent, he initially believes Tormund is Mance and kneels before him. Tormund is amused though Mance's suspicions of Jon makes Tormund wary.\n\nAs Mance's army marches away from the Frostfangs, Tormund, alongside Ygritte, accompanies Orell as Orell performs scouting duties by warging into his eagle.\n\nTormund accompanies Mance, along with Orell, Ygritte and Jon Snow, to the Fist of the First Men, where they see the mutilated horse corpses left behind by the White Walkers after their attack against the Night's Watch. Mance commands Tormund to climb the Wall along with twenty raiders and Jon Snow, and wait for his signal to attack Castle Black from behind.\n\nAs Tormund's party comes closer to the Wall, Tormund questions Jon about the \"crows\" patrolling the top of the Wall spotted by Orell's eagle. Jon explains that the patrols are two Builders and two Rangers. Orell then questions Jon about the castles still manned by the Watch and the number of men in the garrison of Castle Black, disbelieving Jon's claim that a thousand men defend it. When Orell and Ygritte, who defends Jon, are about to start a fight, Tormund puts a stop to it throwing Orell away. Tormund tells Jon he likes him but will kill him nonetheless if he's lying. Jon remains adamant on his lie, but Tormund remains doubtful.\n\nTormund's party camps at a patch of the Haunted Forest that has been left unchecked and grown close to the Wall. Tormund comments to Jon that, once, crows would cut down any the trees within a mile of the Wall. When Jon asks Ygritte if she's ever climbed the Wall she confesses she hasn't, but Tormund has done it many times. After a few minutes, Tormund approaches Jon again and gives him a climbing pick. He advises Jon to sink it deep into the ice of the Wall and make sure it holds before taking the next step. He then jokes that if he falls, he better not scream because he wouldn't want that be the last thing Ygritte remembers about him.\n\nTormund's party breaks into four smaller groups to climb the Wall. Tormund leads one of them, with Orell, Yrgitte, and Jon sharing the same rope. Tormund's pick breaks a piece of ice that causes Jon to briefly lose his footing. The Wildling leader jokes that he wanted to see if he could take a hit. The raiding party climb further, but a portion of the Wall breaks down, taking one of the groups to their deaths. The ice keeps breaking and Tormund nails his pick hard to prevent them from falling, but Ygritte and Jon do drop, and end up dangling in the air. Tormund holds the rope with one hand but Orell begins cutting the rope to prevent Jon and Ygritte from bringing them down. Jon reaches the ice just as Orell cuts Ygritte loose. Later, the group reaches an abandoned watchpost of the Night's Watch. Ygritte and Jon reach the top as Tormund gathers his rope.\n\nTormund and the raiding party climb down from the Wall and begin their march to take Castle Black unaware. Some time later, the party encamps in a forest area of the Gift. Tormund jokingly gives Jon some advice on how to properly have sex with a woman before ordering the group to begin the march again.\n\nSome time afterward, Tormund's party reach the hut of a man who breeds horses for the Night's Watch. Orell advises attacking the man and killing him for his horses and gold. Tormund muses he may have good steel. Jon argues to spare the man and just take the horses, as the Watch will send less men to track down thieves than for a murderer. Tormund hopes for more men as it will be easier to kill them in the open than in Castle Black. Tormund orders his men to spread out to attack the hut. The man escapes after his horses react to a noise made by Jon to warn him.\n\nTormund and his men capture the man at an abandoned mill. Orell manages to hear noise inside the mill - it's Bran and Rickon Stark, along with their companions - but Tormund dismisses it as thunder from the rain that is just beginning. Tormund then questions the man about where he was riding. The man refuses to answer because he'll die anyway, and Tormund admits he's right. Tormund bares his sword to kill the man, who asks to die standing up, but Orell intervenes and demands that Jon kill the man. Tormund orders Jon to do it, but Jon hesitates. Ygritte carries out the execution after Jon is unable to. Orell goads Tormund into killing Jon to prevent him from betraying them and Tormund relents, ordering his men to kill Jon. Tormund restrains Ygritte when she tries to interfere to protect her lover. As Ygritte rages, he tells her not to die for a crow. Several members of Tormund's party, among them Orell, are killed by Jon as well as Summer and Shaggydog.\n\nTormund has his raiding party encamped in a stone ravine south of the Wall. Tormund chides Ygritte for failing to finish off Jon Snow; he has enough faith in her as an archer to believe that that if Jon escaped, it was because she allowed him to. Suddenly, their scouts signal that someone is approaching. Styr and a band of Thenn approach them through the ravine. Out of earshot, Tormund comments about how much he hates Thenns. Styr says his party raided a village south of the ravine and gathered meat. He says the meat tastes so much better south of the Wall, and chides Tormund for losing their warg as well as Jon. He reminds Tormund how the Night's Watch are feasting and getting fat at Castle Black. Styr suggests that Tormund taste crow meat before he dies, as a human arm roasts over a fire.\n\nTormund and Styr lead a raid on a village south of the Wall. When one villager attempts to attack Tormund from behind, Ygritte shoots him before he can strike and Tormund finishes him off. Styr sends Olly to Castle Black as a message to the brothers of the Night's Watch.\n\nTormund and Styr attack the settlement of Mole's Town. They slaughter all of the inhabitants, which include members of the Night's Watch who were visiting the local brothel. News of this attack reaches Castle Black, which is their next target.\n\nTormund takes part in the rear assault on Castle Black, being the first one to infiltrate the fortress. He kills many black brothers and then engages Alliser Thorne in single combat. They are evenly matched, but Tormund manages to seriously wound Ser Alliser, who is then pulled to safety by his fellow black brothers. Tormund continues his rampage along the Castle, despite receiving multiple wounds from arrows and swords. After all of the rear assault forces are slain, only Tormund remains and is incapacitated by a crossbow bolt from Jon Snow. He is then taken prisoner for interrogation.\n\nAfter Mance's forces on the other side of the Wall are defeated by the surprise appearance of Stannis Baratheon, Jon comes to Tormund, who has had his wounds tended to by Maester Aemon. Jon informs Tormund that they will be burning the dead wildlings' bodies and asks if he wishes to say any words in their memory. Tormund scoffs at the idea, telling him that the dead can't hear them. Tormund then asks Jon if he loved Ygritte and explains that Ygritte had truly loved Jon, her constant talk of killing him being proof of that. Tormund solemnly requests that Jon take Ygritte's body north of the Wall to burn it, since that's what she would have wanted. Jon complies with Tormund's wish and soon after has Ygritte's body burned on a funeral pyre beyond the Wall.\n\nTormund, alongside his fellow wildlings, are present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee. He is visibly distressed to see his king and longtime friend executed in such a brutal manner, a burning at the stake. However, before Mance is burnt, Jon mercifully shoots him dead with an arrow, an act that Tormund would remember as honorable. With Mance Rayder dead, Tormund becomes the new leader of the remnants of the wildling army.\n\nOnce Stannis leaves the jurisdiction of the wildling prisoners to Lord Commander Jon Snow, he suggested that Tormund might be more open to forming the same alliance Mance Rayder rejected. Some time later, Jon meets with a chained Tormund to discuss what will happen with the wildlings next. Jon offers Tormund lands south of the Wall for the wildlings to settle after they have rounded up the surviving Free Folk north of the Wall in return for their help in defeating the White Walkers when they march on the Wall. Tormund is reluctant at first, and after Jon unchains him, he discloses that most of the remaining Free Folk who are north of the Wall are at Hardhome. Jon offers him horses and men to bring them back, yet Tormund states that they will also need ships in order to bring all the wildlings to Castle Black, and that Jon must accompany them to assure the Free Folk they will not simply set fire to all the ships and kill them all. Jon agrees and says he will borrow the ships from Stannis, which he later does, just before Stannis abandons Castle Black and marches on Winterfell.\n\nDays later, Tormund alongside Jon Snow, Dolorous Edd and other brothers of the Night's Watch, leaves Castle Black for Eastwatch to board the ships that take them to Hardhome.\n\nTormund and Jon, along with other members of the Night's Watch and the Free Folk, arrive at the Wildling town Hardhome to convince the rest of the Wildlings to join them in the upcoming war against the White Walkers and their armies of Wights.\n\nInsisting on never being an ally with a Crow, The Lord of Bones insults Tormund for being at the side of Jon Snow, causing Tormund to beat his former ally to death with his own staff. The Wildling elders decide to gather in the Townshall to hear Jon, who quickly proposes an alliance between the Free Folk and the Night's Watch in the face of their common enemy, the undead. Having not seen Mance Rayder since he was taken prisoner at The Wall, the Wildlings question his whereabouts. Snow reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally, with an arrow. This angers the group, but as they move in to kill him, Tormund vouches for him, describing how Rayder was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from Stannis Baratheon, and how Snow defied Stannis by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him. Some leaders are convinced, but others begin to leave.\n\nA few hours later Tormund is helping the Night's Watch load the boats and Jon queries how many wildlings have boarded estimating about 5,000 and worried that they are leaving too many behind. Tormund says he's not good at counting but that the wildlings are stubborn however, more will join because \"they're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt\".\n\nA large host of undead wights then storm Hardhome and start breaking through the gate and wall seperating a small segment of Hardhome. Jon and Tormund fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships. Edd Tollet, Wun Wun, and others are trapped inside the townhall, which is set upon by wights and catches fire \u2013 in the confusion, the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost. On top of a hill overlooking Hardhome, multiple White Walkers mounted on undead horses observe the battle, including The Night's King. The White Walkers deploy another large host of wights, hurling them over the cliffs above Hardhome. Jon, Edd, Tormund and the remaining defenders flee for their lives. Flanked by Wun Wun, who wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them, they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance. As Jon and the others look on in horror, the Night's King raises his arms triumphantly; all around him, the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights.\n\nDays later, Jon, Tormund, and the surviving few thousand wildlings from Hardhome, arrive at the Wall, presumably in two groups, before the gates of Castle Black and are allowed through by a very reluctant Ser Alliser Thorne.\n\nIn response to Jon Snow's death at the hands of mutineers led by Alliser Thorne, Eddison Tollett leaves to find Tormund and the wildlings and get their help in the coming struggle for their lives against Thorne and his men.\n\nAfter Edd finds him, Tormund leads the wildlings to attack Castle Black. Once inside, Tormund quickly kills a brother who attacks him, and with help from Wun Wun, the rest surrender without a fight. After the mutineers are detained, Tormund examines Jon's body, then asks Davos to burn it as quickly as possible. Later, Tormund witnesses Melisandre attempt to resurrect Jon, and is the first to leave the room when she seemingly fails, seconds before Jon awakens.\n\nWhen Jon awakens and is clothed by Davos, Tormund sees Jon coming from the room and explains that the wildlings think that he is a god. Tormund then remarks how he knows Jon isn't a god as no god would have a penis as small as his. He proceeds to hug Jon and welcomes him back. Tormund later watches the execution of the mutineers in the crowd.\n\nWhen Sansa Stark arrives at Castle Black with Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne, a surprised Tormund can't stop staring at Brienne, then witnesses Sansa's reunion with Jon, her half-brother. Tormund later shares a meal with Jon, Sansa, Brienne, Podrick and Edd. As he eats, Tormund gives Brienne a flirtatious glance. When Jon reads a letter from Ramsay Bolton, Tormund stops eating and listens intently, visibly angered at Ramsay's threats to him and his fellow wildlings. Tormund asks Sansa how many men Ramsay has. Sansa claims he has around five thousand, and Tormund tells Jon that from the thousands of wildlings they saved from Hardhome, only two thousand are able to fight.\n\nTormund attends a war council with Jon, Sansa, Davos, Brienne, Podrick and Edd, remaining silent while listening to Jon, Sansa and Davos's strategies. While leaving Castle Black, Tormund again gazes at Brienne with lust, leaving Brienne uneasy.\n\nTormund is present as Jon attempts to convince Dim Dalba to join his cause, along with the remaining wildling forces. Dim suggests that Jon is violating the original agreement, as the Free Folk were not required to fight the Boltons. Jon insists that if his army is defeated, the Boltons, Karstarks, and Umbers will inevitably march on the Free Folk settled in The Gift. Tormund reminds Dim that Jon died for them, and exclaims that if they were not willing to do the same for him, they were cowards; and they deserved to be the last Free Folk. Wun Wun stands up and proclaims \"Snow\", confirming his allegiance. Consequently, Dim and the wildings agree to join Jon and Sansa's campaign to recapture Winterfell for House Stark.\n\nAfter the meeting, Tormund assures Jon that the wildings will be present at the battle. He does so by reminding Jon that the Free Folk aren't as manipulative as Southerners, and that they will keep their word.\n\nPrior to the battle, Tormund attends the parley between Jon Snow and Ramsay Bolton. Sansa refuses Ramsay's terms of surrender and the Stark party returns to their camp. That night, Tormund is a part of Jon's war council where he cautions Jon of Ramsay's cavalry that would tear the wilding forces a part. Tormund and Davos leave the tent and discuss their current situation. Tormund believes there is hope for a victory as the Boltons have never fought the Free Folk. They discuss their experiences serving Kings and Tormund reminds Davos that Stannis burnt Mance, a man unworthy of the fate he suffered. Tormund reaffirms to Davos that he believed in Mance, just as Davos believed in Stannis. Davos suggests that perhaps their mistake was placing their faith in Kings. Tormund reminds him that Jon is not a King and offers Davos a jug of sour goat's milk, Davos declines, stating he prefers to walking and thinking in solitude before a battle.  During the Battle of the Bastards, Tormund once again fights alongside Jon. After is Rickon is killed, Tormund is concerned that Jon will charge alone. As Jon charges full tilt, Davos gives the command for the Stark cavalry to charge. Tormund leads the infantry that follows. In the midst of the battle, Tormund saves Jon from a Bolton infantryman who almost overwhelms him. Visibly shaken, Jon is helped off the ground by Tormund who ascertains if he is okay. As the Stark forces are surrounded, Tormund repeatedly attempts to break the Bolton pike phalanx but is ultimately overwhelmed. Pushed beyond his limits, Tormund panics and sends his wildlings towards the hill of corpses. This unintentionally causes Jon to be trampled by the stampede, nearly suffocating him. Tormund is confronted by Lord Smalljon Umber and is soon overpowered by him. As the Stark forces are about to lose, the Knights of the Vale arrive, smashing the Bolton forces apart. While Lord Smalljon is distracted by the charge, Tormund bites his neck, then stabs him, killing him.\n\nHe, Jon and Wun Wun pursue Ramsay back to Winterfell where Wun Wun breaks down the castle gate. As they storm the courtyard, Tormund and Jon watch in horror as Wun Wun succumbs to his injuries sustained during the battle and the siege. Ramsay looses an arrow into the giant's eye, killing him. Tormund uneasily watches as Jon advances on Ramsay and eventually subdues him.\n\nHe is later present Jon with the body of his brother Rickon Stark.\n\nTormund is later present when Jon is crowned the King in the North. He briefly disputes with Lord Yohn Royce, claiming that Jon invited him and the wildlings south of the Wall instead of them invading as Royce believed. Although by now a close friend and ally of Jon, he stays true to his beliefs and doesn't take part in hailing him king.\n\nAs the castles at the wall are severely undermanned, Jon sends Tormund and the Wildlings north to man them. Tormund is sent to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, as this is the castle closest to Hardhome where the Night King was last seen and, thus, a potential target. Before leaving, Tormund jokes that he and his Free Folk are the Night's Watch now.\n\nHe later flirts with Brienne, and remarks Podrick Payne is a \"lucky man\" as Brienne knocks him to the ground.\n\nA while later, Tormund is visited at Eastwatch by Jon, along with Gendry and Jorah Mormont, who have journeyed north to capture a wight to bring before Queens Cersei Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen to convince them both of the common threat of the Night King. Tormund quips that they are not the only ones and takes them to the ice cells, where he his holding Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr and Sandor Clegane. During the ensuing exchange, Tormund learns Jorah's real name and deduces he is the son of Jeor Mormont, who hunted the wildlings \"like animals\", though Jorah retorts that the wildlings did the same to the Night's Watch. Hostilities are quickly put aside when they all accept they are on the same side and Jon frees the Brotherhood. Tormund joins Jon's expedition North to capture a wight. During the expedition, Tormund exchanges banter with Gendry and Jon Snow. When Jon explains that Daenerys will only ally with them if he submits to her rule, Tormund remarks that Jon has grown prideful and independent as a result of his time spent with the Free Folk. However, Tormund remarks that standing on pride can be a dangerous thing, using his late friend and leader Mance Rayder as an example. He later banters with Sandor Clegane, the latter shooting down the idea of Tormund winning Brienne's heart. As they get closer to a pack of wights, they are attacked by an undead polar bear which mortally wounds Thoros but which is killed by Jorah. Later, they ambush a pack of wights led by a White Walker, and as soon as Jon slays the Walker, all but one of the wights fall lifeless. As the wight screams for help and Jon instructs Gendry to return to Eastwatch and send a raven to Daenerys, Tormund implores him to leave his warhammer behind as it will slow him down. The party end up stranded in the middle of a frozen lake where Thoros eventually dies of his wounds. When the lake freezes over again, a fierce melee ensues. Tormund destroys many wights with a dragonglass battleaxe, but he is eventually tackled by two wights, who almost drag him underwater. He is saved at the last minute by Sandor. Daenerys eventually arrives and saves them with her dragons, though Viserion is killed by the Night King in the process, and they make it back to Eastwatch. Tormund helps them load the wight into a boat, and shares a farewell nod with Sandor in gratitude for saving his life.\n\nSome time later, Tormund and Beric are manning Eastwatch's defenses when the army of the dead arrives, led by the Night King astride a newly-reanimated Viserion. When Tormund sees the dragon bearing down on them, he screams for everyone to run. Tormund watches as Viserion burns right through the Wall, causing Eastwatch to collapse. Whether Tormund survives these events is currently unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tormund"}}

George R.R. Martin himself has noted that Mace in the TV series seems to be a condensation of book-Mace with book-Harys Swyft, given that TV-Mace is portrayed as a jovial buffoon - and as he noted, in the book version, Harys Swyft is unintelligent but Mace Tyrell is not. On the other hand, in the Season 5 Blu-ray commentary, writer Bryan Cogman half-jokingly said that TV-Mace is anything but an imbecile, and he only plays the fool - what Cogman called \"an I, Claudius thing\", pretending to be a useless buffoon in order to trick his rivals into thinking he is harmless. Whether Cogman was being serious or not is of course unclear, though it would match Martin's well-known love for I, Claudius and his use of the trope in which a character pretends to be less dangerous than they actually are (a trick used by all three of the mainstays on the Small Council in Season 1: Pycelle, Varys, and Littlefinger)."],"name":"Mace Tyrell","description":"Mace Tyrell is the Lord of Highgarden and head of House Tyrell, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. He is the Lord Paramount of the Reach and Warden of the South. The Tyrells are one of the richest and most powerful families in Westeros, second only to the Lannisters - for while the mountains of the Westerlands possess rich gold mines, the fields of the Reach are the most fertile in Westeros, capable of supporting armies almost twice the size of any other kingdom.\n\nMace is not considered a great strategist or general himself - his own mother Olenna openly describes him as an oaf, though not out of spite. On the other hand, he has shown good judgment in delegating such tasks to trusted, skilled subordinates, such as the famous general Randyll Tarly, who often commands Mace's forces in battle.\n\nMace might not be the most intelligent man, but he is an amiable fellow well-liked by most of his bannermen, as well a loving husband and father. Mace has one son, Loras, and a daughter, Margaery, arguably the most eligible woman in the Seven Kingdoms. Mace hopes to make a good match for her to increase the already considerable power and influence of his family. Mace is particularly eager for Margaery to secure a royal marriage for their family because unlike some of the other Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms such as the Starks or Lannisters, the Tyrells never ruled as kings in their own right, but were granted control of the Reach as a reward for submitting to Aegon the Conqueror during the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago. Thus entering into the royal bloodline would increase House Tyrell's prestige and secure their rule over their fractious vassals in the Reach.\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Mace and House Tyrell stayed loyal to House Targaryen. The Tyrells owed their rule over Highgarden and the Reach to the Targaryen kings, who after the Targaryen Conquest three centuries before had awarded rule of the Reach to the Tyrells ahead of other families from the region which actually had better claims (such as House Florent). The Tyrell armies were able to inflict the only defeat that Robert Baratheon suffered during the entire war at the Battle of Ashford. Afterwards, Mace's massive army moved east to lay siege to the mighty castle-seat of the Baratheons, Storm's End. The Siege of Storm's End lasted the better part of a year, while Mace and his commanders feasted in sight of the starving garrison led by Robert's younger brother Stannis. Ultimately Stannis's determined defense held, and the siege only succeeded in pinning down Mace's army and preventing it from assisting the Targaryens in the climactic battles occurring further north. After the Sack of King's Landing, Eddard Stark rode south with the main rebel army to relieve the siege. With the capital city in rebel hands, and both Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and his father Mad King Aerys dead, Mace saw that the war was clearly lost and gave no battle to Lord Eddard. Instead he peacefully dipped his banners and submitted to Robert's rule, and in return was treated leniently, pardoned, and allowed to continue ruling the Reach as his family had before the war. However, ever since there was never any great love between Mace Tyrell and Stannis Baratheon.\n\nSer Loras tells Renly that his father would support Renly's claim to the Iron Throne. Renly rejects the notion, pointing out he is fourth in line to the throne, but Loras explains that he could fight for Renly and his father would bankroll their armies. Renly seems more intrigued by the notion and later accepts the plan, though he fails to win the support of Lord Eddard Stark. Along with Loras, Renly flees the city of King's Landing and heads south towards the Tyrell homelands. It is later reported that Renly has been crowned king, with the full support of Lord Mace Tyrell and his forces.\n\nDavos Seaworth mentions to Stannis Baratheon that Lord Mace is amongst the many lords that have declared for Renly Baratheon.\n\nAfter Renly's death, the Tyrells enter into a new alliance with King Joffrey and House Lannister, instead of siding with Renly's brother Stannis, who is correctly suspected of having something to do with Renly's death.\n\nLord Mace is mentioned by his mother, Lady Olenna Tyrell, in conversation with Sansa Stark. She describes him as \"a ponderous oaf\" who rushed into a treasonous alliance with Renly and a dangerous one with the Lannisters just to see his daughter become queen.\n\nLady Olenna mentions him again some weeks later when in the Great Sept of Baelor with Cersei. She says that Mace enjoys hunting because it hides the fact that he's never been in a real battle. Cersei expresses surprise, as Lord Mace is well known to have besieged Storm's End for over a year during Robert's Rebellion. Lady Olenna dismisses her son's role, as \"all he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.\"\n\nMace presents Joffrey with a magnificent golden chalice with seven facets, one for each of the major houses in the Seven Kingdoms. He encourages his daughter and soon-to-be son-in-law to both \"drink deep\". Joffrey graciously accepts his gift. Mace gives away Margaery at the wedding before taking his place in the Great Sept of Baelor. Later on, as the party moves from the Sept to the reception feast outside the Red Keep, Mace tries to attract Tywin's attention, but Olenna quickly waves him away in typical fashion, which he cannot help but smile at a little. Some time later, during the wedding feast, Mace is visibly upset by a mock reenactment of the War of the Five Kings in which the dwarf representing Renly Baratheon rides a bare-bottom figure meant to represent Loras.\n\nAfter Tyrion Lannister is arrested for the assassination of King Joffrey, Lord Tyrell accepts Tywin's proposal to be one of the judges for Tyrion's forthcoming trial, the other two being Tywin himself and Prince Oberyn Martell.\n\nMace later attends the coronation of Tommen Baratheon.\n\nAlongside Tywin and Oberyn, Mace sits as a judge during the trial of Tyrion Lannister. He is shocked when he learns that Shae was Tyrion's whore as well as handmaiden to Sansa Stark and about the words that Tyrion said to his sister, about that she will lose everything eventually. The trial is brought to an end when Tyrion demands a trial by combat.\n\nMace is present during Tyrion's trial by combat and witnesses Oberyn's gruesome death at the hands of Gregor Clegane.\n\nMace Tyrell is one of the many lords present at Tywin Lannister's wake.\n\nSome time later, Lord Mace attends a meeting of the Small Council. Like Grand Maester Pycelle and Kevan Lannister, he is somewhat disturbed to see that Cersei has appointed Qyburn to replace Varys. He nonetheless hastily puts himself forward as a candidate for Hand of the King, but Cersei declares that he is instead to be jointly appointed Master of Ships and Master of Coin.\n\nMace Tyrell is present during the wedding ceremony of Tommen Baratheon and his daughter Margaery. Later, Mace and the rest of the Small Council listen to the High Septon demand the arrest of all members of the Sparrows and execution of the High Sparrow. He is shocked to hear a man who is the head of the Faith of the Seven was visiting a brothel.\n\nIn a Small Council meeting Mace reveals that the Iron Bank has called in one tenth of the Crown's debts. When asked by Cersei, Mace admits that the Crown can not pay back more than half of the demanded sum. When Mace offers that House Tyrell could front the money to the Iron Throne and then be paid back afterwards, Cersei politely refuses, stating that the Tyrells have already given too much. In reality however, this is because she doesn't want to give the Tyrells any more power by granting them the ability to hold the debt payment over them. She then tasks Mace with personally travelling to Braavos to negotiate better terms with the Iron Bank. She also tells Mace that the king, concerned for his father-in-law's safety, has assigned Ser Meryn Trant to escort Mace to Braavos. Mace and Meryn leave immediately, prompting Pycelle to state that the Small Council grows smaller and smaller.\n\nAfter arriving in Braavos, he is greeted by Tycho Nestoris who welcomes him in the name of the Iron Bank. On the way to the Iron Bank, he talks with Tycho about the harvest in the Reach and King Maegor III who once outlawed moneylending. Unbeknownst to all of them, they are followed by Arya Stark, who recognised Ser Meryn. Arriving at the Iron Bank, Mace admires the facade of the enormous building, stating that the men of the Iron Bank are the world's best gamblers, much to Tycho's disapproval. After an unspecified time of negotiation, Tycho tries to bid farewell to Mace (whom he clearly dislikes due to his bumbling behaviour), but Mace does not realize this and continues plaguing Tycho on the way to the docks, loudly singing.\n\nAt night, while following Trant, Arya overhears Meryn telling two Lannister soldiers how poorly he thinks of Mace and the Tyrells, going as far as calling them traitors.\n\nMace returns to King's Landing and attends a Small Council meeting to discuss his children's imprisonment, which is soon interrupted by Jamie, Cersei, and Gregor Clegane. When Cersei questions Olenna Tyrell's presence, Mace begins to defend his mother, but she quickly speaks for herself. Mace rises and follows his mother and Kevan Lannister when they leave the chamber.\n\nLater, Mace leads Tyrell troops through King's Landing, meeting Jaime Lannister and pausing to give a rather pompous speech. They proceed to the Sept of Baelor to stop Margaery's walk of atonement and free both his children. Lady Olenna also joins them. After Jaime and the High Sparrow square off and Tommen emerges from the sept, Olenna signals Mace to stand down his men. After the King gives a speech, Mace is baffled and asks his mother what's happening. Visibly annoyed, she tells him the High Sparrow has beaten them.\n\nMace is present when King Tommen makes a royal announcement regarding the date of both Cersei and Loras's trials and that the practice of trial by combat is abolished. Mace is visibly uncomfortable during the king's speech but does not speak.\n\nMace is present at his son Loras' trial in the Great Sept of Baelor. He is visibly distraught when Loras joins the Faith Militant and tries to intervene when his son has the symbol of the Seven carved into his forehead, but Margaery restrains him. He, Margaery, Loras, and everyone present at the trial, are killed from the explosion of wildfire caused by Cersei in her plot to destroy her enemies. Despite having constantly belittled and mocked her son's lack of intelligence, Olenna is clearly grieved by his death, as well as those of Margaery and Loras - which drives her to seek alliance with both Dorne and Daenerys Targaryen, in order to gain vengeance against Cersei.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mace_Tyrell"}}

However, the city was sacked before the weapon could be unleashed and many of the Wisdoms assassinated.\n\nQueen Regent Cersei Lannister commissions the Alchemist's Guild to produce wildfire for the defense of the city.

Tyrion recalls an old sailor\u2019s proverb \u201CPiss on wildfire and your cock burns off.\u201D Bronn grins and Wisdom Hallyne says that he has never conducted that particular experiment.

If the pregnant khaleesi is able to consume the entire stallion's heart, it means the Khal's unborn child will be strong. It is a negative omen if the pregnant khaleesi fails to consume the entire raw heart, or retches any of it up (made all the more difficult because a pregnant woman's stomach is more sensitive than under normal circumstances)."],"name":"Stallion heart","description":"According to actress Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), the prop she used for the stallion's heart was made of gummy bear-like material, which actually tasted awful, so the difficulty with which she seems to be choking it down is actually a genuine physical reaction. It had to be something she could really bite, chew, and swallow, because it would have seemed fake if she was only miming the act of eating a prop without actually consuming pieces of it.\n\nThe gummy-heart was injected with fake-blood which was basically a sugary syrup, so that it could burst out as she bit into the heart, the way real coagulated blood would if she were eating a real stallion's heart. By the end the actress was covered in the stuff, which was like glue, and everything stuck to her. When she used the bathroom she even glued herself to the toilet seat.\n\nIn the \"Inside the Episode\" featurette, D.B. Weiss described the prop as \"basically a giant, three-pound gummy bear, covered in fake sugar-blood...which had the added attraction of drawing real flies.\" Weiss also confirmed that the point when Daenerys almost retches up the heart was a real physical reaction. Moreover, Clarke is a relatively small young woman (as TV-Daenerys is only sixteen years old), and the horse heart prop was literally half the size of her head. The production team also pointed out that Daenerys might only have eaten the heart once within the story, but Clarke had to film multiple and prolonged takes eating the heart, because the entire scene focuses on it, and it has to go on in the background even while Viserys is talking to Jorah. The prop was intentionally made to taste bad to further Clarke's performance - if it tasted pleasant like regular candy, it would have lost some of the effect that Daenerys is choking down awful-tasting, bloodsoaked raw meat. Clarke herself noted in the featurette that the prop was incredibly realistic, and even contained dried pasta (dyed red) to simulate veins running through the heart.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, it is forbidden to bare bladed steel within Vaes Dothrak. The TV series mentions this with regard to people, but the book goes on to establish that it is even forbidden to use steel blades to butcher animals. Thus Drogo and his bloodriders slaughtered the stallion and cut out its heart using stone knives.\n\nThe book also states what the negative consequences are if Daenerys fails to eat all of the stallion's heart: it is an ill omen meaning that the child might be stillborn, come forth weak or deformed, or worse, female.\n\nDaenerys' handmaidens helped her ready herself for the ceremony by having her dine on bowls of half-clotted horse blood, to prepare her for the taste. Daenerys also didn't eat for a full day and night beforehand in the hope that hunger would help her keep the large amount of tough meat down. Even with this preparation the ceremony is grueling: Daenerys nearly gags several times and her stomach churns, but she finds the strength to finish.\n\nAs Daenerys had only recently begun to learn the Dothraki language, the book explains that Daenerys learned her responses to the dosh khaleen by rote. Her handmaiden Jhiqui taught her the phrase \"Khalakka dothrae mr'anha\"! (A prince rides inside me!), and she practiced it with her for three days beforehand.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Stallion_heart"}}

She married into House Arryn through her marriage to Jon Arryn. After Jon's death, whom she had secretly murdered on behalf of Petyr Baelish, her true lover and later second husband, she became the Lady Regent of the Vale, ruling on behalf of her young son, Robin Arryn. She doted on her son and pursued a policy of isolationism during the War of the Five Kings despite her blood ties to House Stark.","Jon died shortly before the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement. Lysa fled King's Landing for the safety of the Eyrie with Robin, then six-years old. Though Robin became the titular Lord Paramount of the Vale after his father's death, his mother in fact assumed rulership as the Lady Regent of the Vale until her son came of age. She is considered mentally unstable by Tyrion Lannister.","Tyrion convinces Lysa to give him a trial, only to protest his innocence. He demands the right of trial by combat, supported by the mercenary Bronn. Bronn wins the battle, killing Lysa's champion, Ser Vardis Egen. Lysa chides Bronn for not fighting with honor, but reluctantly releases Tyrion.","Lysa remains in the Eyrie, and does not attend her father's funeral. Despite the Vale's neutrality, Tywin Lannister arranges a marriage alliance between Lysa and Petyr Baelish to fight the rest of her family.","Lysa witnesses Littlefinger kissing Sansa in the Eyrie's gardens, which causes her to snap and go mad with jealousy, believing Sansa to be the one who instigated the kiss. She summons Sansa to the High Hall of the Arryns, threatening to push her out the Moon Door to her death, but is interrupted by Petyr.\u200B Emotionally distraught and torn over Littlefinger's infatuation with Sansa, Lysa falls into a fit of tears, shoving her to the floor. Littlefinger feigns an apology, embraces her and reassures her that he only ever loved one woman. To Lysa's horror, he utters \"your sister\", and then shoves Lysa through the Moon Door to her death, as a shell-shocked Sansa looks on. Later, with Sansa's help, Littlefinger convinces the lords of the Vale that Lysa committed suicide.","During his surprise trial at Winterfell, Littlefinger admits that he murdered Lysa, albeit to protect Sansa. Sansa, however, reveals to the assembled crowd that he actually murdered her to seize power in the Vale. With information provided by Bran, Sansa also reveals that Littlefinger manipulated Lysa into poisoning Jon Arryn and writing a letter to her sister blaming the Lannisters, thus sparking the War of the Five Kings. Ultimately, Littlefinger is executed by Arya Stark, avenging Lysa.","Lysa's marriage to Jon Arryn was very unhappy. She did not love the much older man she was forced to marry; she had five miscarriages, twice in the Eyrie and three at King's Landing; the only child who was born alive turned to be mentally and physically ill."],"name":"Lysa Arryn","description":"Lysa Arryn was characterized by her capacity for jealousy: she was unendingly jealous of her sister Catelyn for being the first choice in every matter that would have benefited either one of them, and for Lysa herself always landing with the second best option - her marriage to Jon Arryn, for instance, as opposed to Ned Stark. Her jealousy of her sister also led to her referring to Catelyn in diabolical terms. This led to Lysa being withdrawn, lonely, cold, apathetic, malignantly willful and subjective to fits of anger that were often unjustified, to the extent that she saw enemies in anyone who disagreed with her. Lysa's jealousy of Catelyn was completely typical, if not entirely overgrown, of sibling contempt; the younger sibling jealous of the opportunities and fortunes afforded to the older sibling simply on the basis that she is the older sibling rather than acknowledging that her sister's good fortune could be the result of hard work or luck.\n\nShe was, however, extremely unstable and temperamental to a fault. She had psychological issues that were famed but never narrowed down in terms of origins or cause - people often labelled her as simply being mad or temperamental, without seeing much complexity in her behavior. The most likely cause of her instability was her life of solitude and being second-benefited by everyone. She tended to go to incredible extremes in terms of her actions because of her instability - she loved her son Robin to such a dangerous degree that she had delusions about him being strong and diligent and gallant, when Robin was in fact weak, timid, spoiled and lacking in intellect or physical advantage (in stark contrast to the likes of Robb Stark). She wasn't as much protective of him, as she was protective over something that she could be proud of - proud, that is, for no logical reason other than her own delusions about his majesty, showing that she rather saw Robin as an extravagant extension of herself.\n\nThe extremes of Lysa's emotions made her extremely violent and intensely aggressive, generally lightning-fast-to-anger. She was easily infuriated by any suggestion that intimidated her, or more accurately her peace of mind. She was so violent that she, in a fit of rage, tried to throw Sansa out of the Moon Door when Petyr kissed her, regardless of the logical evidence that Petyr kissed Sansa and Sansa was innocent in the matter, but Lysa's ego wouldn't let her accept this - she was completely blind to how dangerous Petyr truly was. She would also turn rather sadistic, to the point that she believed that throwing Tyrion (an innocent man, whom she perceived to be guilty based on her prejudice and the fact that he was a Lannister, one of the most powerful and dangerous Houses in Westeros) out of the Moon Door was elegance.\n\nLysa's arrogance and vicious inferiority complex was probably the most fatal element to her twisted and immoral character. She held such an amount of self-worth that she believed that she and Petyr Baelish would be a perfect couple based on her intense obsession with him. She believed that, though Petyr loved Catelyn, she loved him no more than the whores in his brothels and didn't even perceive him as an option for companionship. The almost poetic irony here is that Petyr held Lysa in precisely that same regard, in that he had no love for her, but was very easily able to convince her to poison her husband and accuse the Lannisters of it to get the Starks and Lannisters fighting and start the War of the Five Kings, something that effectively led to the deaths of her sister, uncle, two of her nephews and her brother's capture by House Frey. Due to her selfish desire to be with Petyr, Lysa effectively betrayed many of her family to their deaths, and when Petyr confronted her at the Moon Door over the subject of who he loved, he was effortlessly able to lull her into a sense of security by claiming he loved only one woman all his life until he revealed it was \"[her] sister.\" Her final expression before being thrown out of the Moon Door was shock and incredulity at it being Catelyn, before and even after Petyr ruthlessly pushed her through her own Moon Door.\n\nAn almost glaring example of hypocrisy in Lysa was the fact that she claimed family meant everything to her, but she nevertheless refused to directly involve herself in the War of the Five Kings (which would include standing by her sister's family, which was also Lysa's own family, in the process), more concerned with one particular member of her family: her weak, spoiled son. Her claim that family meant everything to her was probably a tactless attempt at surpassing her sister in the argument that was taking place at the time. All in all, Lysa's preference of a warped idea of love over her own house's words (Family, Duty, Honor) kick-started the entire Game of Thrones, and the Seven Kingdoms have been suffering the repercussions ever since.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lysa_Arryn"}}

He is Balon and Alannys's fourth child after Rodrik, Maron, and Yara. Eight years before the start of the series Balon rose in rebellion against the Iron Throne. The ironborn were crushed in a war led by King Robert Baratheon and Lord Eddard Stark. Theon's brothers were both killed in the fighting. Balon surrendered and was allowed to remain Lord of the Iron Islands on the condition that Theon remain a hostage and ward of Eddard Stark. Theon's sister Yara remained on the Iron Islands. Despite his status as a hostage at Winterfell, Theon was treated well by the Starks, and he came to see Eddard as a surrogate father, while becoming best friends with Robb Stark and forming a friendly rivalry with Jon Snow. Theon is a skilled archer. His cocky arrogance and cavalier actions contrast with the staid ways of the North.","Theon is present during the execution of Will, a deserter from the Night's Watch. He holds the scabbard of Ice, the greatsword of House Stark, as Lord Eddard Stark draws it to behead the condemned man. On the way back to Winterfell, the party finds a disemboweled stag dead in the road. Looking for the killer, they find a dead female direwolf and five pups huddled by the corpse for warmth. A broken piece of the dead stag's antler is embedded in the direwolf's neck. Eddard initially insists the pups be given a quick death, which Theon cavalierly moves to carry out himself, upsetting Bran and angering Robb. However, Jon Snow tells his father that this is an omen as there are five pups and five Stark children. Eddard consents to allowing his children to adopt the pups. Just as the party leaves, Jon finds a sixth pup, an albino. Theon mockingly declares him the runt of the litter and that he belongs to Jon. Later, Robb, Jon, and Theon get shaves and haircuts, as they ponder the impending arrival of the royal party, notably the reputation of Queen Cersei Lannister as a great beauty and the poor reputation of Prince Joffrey Baratheon.","Theon appeals to Robb to seek an alliance with his father, Balon Greyjoy, reasoning that Robb needs a fleet to attack King's Landing, and confident that Balon will listen to him. Despite Catelyn's reservations that Balon Greyjoy cannot be trusted, Robb sends Theon home to Pyke as his envoy. Theon seduces the daughter of the ship's captain and tells her about how he will be welcomed home. He is deflated at the lack of a reception for his return. His sister Yara poses as a stranger and offers to give him a ride to the castle. She wants to see what Theon has grown up to be. He flirts with her relentlessly and brags about his own importance. Balon greets Theon coolly, believing that he has forgotten his roots and become loyal to the Starks in his time away. He insults Theon's fine clothes given to him by the Starks, and is furious when Theon tells him that Robb thinks of him as a brother. Yara reveals her deception and Balon compares Theon to his sister unfavorably. Balon rejects the alliance Theon suggests and is insulted that Theon thought he would accept being given a crown. He reminds Theon that they pay the iron price and take what they want.","After rescuing him the boy promises Theon to take him to Deepwood Motte to see Yara. When Theon questions his savior, Ramsay lies that he is ironborn as well, growing up on Saltcliffe, and he witnessed Theon being shipped off to Winterfell. Some time later the men reach a holdfast, and Theon questions why they have to sneak inside when surely Yara's men are loyal to her. Ramsay warns Theon that some of the men belong to his father Balon who wants him dead. As Ramsay struggles to open a locked gate Theon confesses his sins. He wanted desperately to impress his father but he knows now that Eddard Stark was his true father. After opening the gate Theon and Ramsay enter a darkened room. The youth lights a torch and much to Theon's horror he's back in the same torture chamber in the Dreadfort. Armed men enter and Ramsay claims that Theon killed their comrades and escaped but he has brought their captive back. Kicking and screaming, a heartbroken Theon is refastened to the rack.","Upon riding into Moat Cailin, Reek finds it in a state of death and decay, littered with corpses and the few remaining men ravaged by disease and exhaustion. He introduces himself as Prince Theon and truthfully informs the ironborn that he has been a prisoner of House Bolton and has been sent to Moat Cailin as their envoy. He reads the terms that House Bolton has laid out for the ironborn, promising them safe passage home if they peacefully surrender Moat Cailin. However, Ralf Kenning, the garrison commander of the ironborn, decries Reek's words as those of a \"whipped dog\" and that he is no true ironborn, nearly causing Reek to become unnerved and drop his facade. However, Reek is saved when one of Kenning's men suddenly buries an axe in his head and accepts Reek's terms of surrender. However, the ironborn are promptly massacred and flayed by Ramsay and his men upon surrendering Moat Cailin. Ramsay reveals to Theon that he never intended to let the ironborn go, and congratulates him by patting him.","When Sansa finally succeeds in breaking out of her room and lighting the candle in the tower, she is confronted by Reek and Myranda on the catwalks, with Myranda pointing a bow at her. Reek begs Sansa not to resist, but Sansa welcomes her fate. However, when Myranda claims that she will spare Sansa and merely maim her, Reek remembers the role Myranda played in his castration. Unwilling to let Sansa suffer the same fate, Reek grabs Myranda and pushes her off the catwalk to her death. Now Theon Greyjoy once again, he takes Sansa and they run when the Bolton cavalry arrives after defeating Stannis Baratheon. With no other choice, and aware of what will come when Ramsay finds Myranda's body, Theon and Sansa jump from the parapet to the snow below.","As Brienne talks with Sansa, Theon overhears that she crossed paths with Arya, while gathering wood to help Podrick start a fire, though he is wary of it, since it may alert Ramsay or his men. Sansa and Brienne decide to head to Castle Black to get to Jon, who will protect them from Ramsay, and though Sansa promises to tell Jon the truth about Bran and Rickon, Theon believes that Jon will still kill him for betraying Robb, executing Rodrik Cassel, and slaughtering Jack and Billy. Theon claims he does not want to be forgiven, even by joining the Night's Watch, and instead decides to return home, knowing that Sansa will be safer with Brienne and Podrick. Before his departure though, Sansa embraces Theon in gratitude for helping her escape Ramsay.","Theon later returns to Dragonstone and is shocked to be met on the beach by none other than Jon Snow; the two have not seen each other since Jon left Winterfell for the Wall, over six years ago. Theon hesitantly greets him and asks if Sansa is all right; Jon angrily grabs him by the collar, saying that Theon saving Sansa from the Boltons is the only reason he won't kill him then and there for betraying House Stark in the first place. Theon informs Jon and Davos that Yara was taken captive by Euron and he needs Daenerys's help to get her back, only for Jon to tell him that she has left Dragonstone to carry out her own attack on the Lannister armies. Theon accompanies Jon's group to the meeting with Queen Cersei, where Euron attempts to force him to swear fealty in order to save Yara. Theon refuses, openly admitting Euron's own dwarf jokes to Tyrion aren't very good. Later, back at Dragonstone, Theon meets with Jon before he prepares to return to the North with Daenerys. As they reflect on their enmities, Theon admits he was conflicted between his birth family and the Starks, though Jon retorts that Ned was more of a father than Balon ever was. Jon assures Theon that he is both a Stark and a Greyjoy, encouraging him to rescue his sister from Euron.","The conquering of Winterfell occurs similarly to the show, except that three of the servants are murdered (in compliance with Jojen's dream): Albelly the guard, Mikken and Septon Chayle. Theon murders Chayle himself, not for resisting, but because \"you and your gods have no place here now\".","Theon lives in constant fear of his cruel master. He knows that no matter how he acts - defiantly or obediently - Ramsay will torture him, simply because he can. He keeps reminding himself that his name is Reek, and suppresses any memories of his former life. After his unsuccessful attempt to escape with Kyra, whenever there seems to be a chance of getting away - Theon quickly dismisses it, certain that it is one of Ramsay's cruel games. "],"name":"Theon Greyjoy","description":"Before his capture by Ramsay Snow, Theon is shown to be rather arrogant, narcissistic and vain, but fundamentally not malicious. He expected acclaim in a multitude of situations even if he were the only one expecting acclaim for it - when he shot a wildling to save Bran, his perspective believed that he had simply saved Bran's life and not risked hitting Bran with the arrow, and also when he returned to the Iron Islands he expected to be coated in glory for being allegedly the only living heir of Balon Greyjoy. He was both baffled and offended that he did not receive a hero's welcome back to Pyke. Also, in order to appear like a strong, accomplished young man, he would gloat over things in an almost ridiculous way - he gloated to Osha that he was the man who captured her, even though Robb Stark fought and captured her. Beneath his confident exterior, however, he is insecure, weak, and unsure of himself. This stems particularly from the fact that he was raised by the Stark family since he was nine years old as their ward\/hostage after his father's failed rebellion against Robert Baratheon, and while he grew up with the Stark children and at at their table, he was always reminded in some way that he was not truly part of the family.\n\nThis subject is shown to irritate Theon greatly, demonstrated when Ros and Tyrion Lannister mention it. His insecurity also leads him to question which is his true family: the Starks or the Greyjoys. Though his father Balon and sister Yara are initially successful at using it to sway Theon to their side when Balon decides to fight the Starks instead of aid them against the Lannisters, this still causes a great deal of conflict in Theon. The ironborn take pride in attacking and stealing from others, \"paying the iron price\" as they call it, but Ned Stark set the example for Theon that other people should be dealt with according to a basic code of honor and justice. Theon tries to become a ruthless ironborn raider to appease his biological father and find a true home again, but the conscience that he developed living with the Starks makes it difficult for him to live up to these expectations. In his efforts to show great strength, Theon proves himself to be something of a hypocrite: when he seizes Winterfell, he promises to Bran that no one would be harmed if Bran surrendered, but minutes later he completely shattered his promise by beheading Ser Rodrik Cassel, consequently ripping apart his suggestion that he would be a merciful lord and ignoring the wise advice of Maester Luwin. Since he was the self-proclaimed Prince of Winterfell, he was completely in his right to decide to spare Ser Rodrik, but he chose the wrong option and humiliated himself even further in the process.\n\nIt is only after Theon becomes a prisoner of the Boltons and realizes that his father has no intention of rescuing him that he admits, to himself and to Ramsay Snow, that Ned Stark was his \"real father\", and laments Ned's execution in King's Landing. Even throughout Theon's capture of Winterfell, he is shown to be in a constant battle with himself, implying that he knows deep down that invading his childhood home for his father was far from right. Maester Luwin even points out to Theon that all of this is just an act to live up to his father's expectations, and that Theon himself must know that his betrayal at Winterfell is wrong. Theon resignedly admits to Luwin that he is correct, but that he can't stop because he has already come too far to be forgiven, and refuses to join the Night's Watch, where all of his crimes would be forgiven, out of shame (and partially out of fear that Jon Snow might kill him in retribution for allegedly murdering Bran and Rickon).\n\nAfter being tortured by Ramsay Snow in the dungeons of the Dreadfort for over a year, Theon's original personality has been seemingly obliterated, and he is little more than a broken and half-insane prisoner. Among various tortures, Ramsay cut off several of his fingers and toes, flayed off sections of his skin, and even cut off his genitals. Ramsay even mockingly renamed him \"Reek\", physically and psychologically torturing him to accept it as his name, and deny that he ever was \"Theon Greyjoy\". Ramsay also psychologically tortured him with fake escape attempts or promises of rescue, before recapturing him, so now Reek thinks any possibility of escape or fighting back against Ramsay is simply another ruse. He lives in great fear of Ramsay, desperate to avoid angering him, and is in such a state of traumatic shock that he is very withdrawn and submissive.\n\nHowever, despite his previous actions, Reek appears to have retained a strong love and loyalty to the remaining Starks, demonstrated on several occasions: he is visibly shocked when Ramsay gloats about Robb's death, briefly holding a razor to Ramsay's neck and appearing on the verge of slitting his throat (though he doesn't because Roose and Locke are present); he appears hesitant about telling them that Bran and Rickon may be sheltering at Castle Black with Jon Snow, knowing that it may lead to their deaths, but does so anyway to avoid angering Ramsay; he silently cries and briefly looks angry when Ramsay rapes Sansa, and does his best (or what he thinks is the best) to keep Sansa from angering Ramsay and suffering more at his hands, and even goes as far as to confess to Sansa that he deserved what he suffered under Ramsay and that he deserved to be Reek for what he did to the Stark family. However, when pushed too far, Theon ultimately abandons his Reek persona and chooses his loyalty to the Starks over Ramsay, by killing Myranda and helping Sansa escape from Winterfell, though still believing himself unworthy of anyone's forgiveness for betraying the Starks, who were the only ones who ever treated him like family.\n\nDespite this admission, Theon still expresses shock after learning of his father's death when he returns to the Iron Islands. Though his sister Yara is still angry with him for refusing to be rescued, they reconcile when Theon offers to support Yara's claim to the Salt Throne. While initially despondent, Theon regains some of his bravado during the Kingsmoot to select the next ruler of the Iron Islands. Giving a brief rousing speech, he manages to convince many of the gathered Ironborn to join him in supporting his sister's claim to the Salt Throne, his speaking skills demonstrating that \"Reek\" has all but been obliterated for good and Theon Greyjoy restored, though he and Yara are outmanuevered by Euron, who wins many over by offering to seal an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nAfter escaping Euron with his sister Yara, Theon slides back into his despondent state and is troubled by his role in the death of the orphan boys; believing that he should hang for his crimes. Yara counsels him to rediscover himself so that they can secure an alliance with Daenerys and retake the Iron Islands from their uncle Euron. While negotiating with Daenerys, Theon does not display reluctance for the Ironborn to cease raping, pillaging and reaving, and nods at Yara to tell her to agree with Daenerys, demonstrating that despite his recovery, he is still greatly traumatized by his torture by Ramsay, and apparently wishes to lead a more peaceful life in order to prevent it from happening again, though it is currently unknown whether or not Theon knows of Ramsay's death, or how he will react when he hears of it.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Theon_Greyjoy"}}

Aemma died during the birth, and her son died a day later). Due to the lack of a male heir, Viserys designated Rhaenyra as his successor. Therefore, Rhaenyra was the only female Targaryen to lay claim to the Iron Throne in her own right. Since she was raised as the designated heir, Rhaenyra became quite pampered and arrogant, but also gained practical governmental experience.","Rhaenyra was married twice, and had five sons. Her first husband was her second cousin, Ser Laenor Velaryon, the son of Lord Corlys Velaryon who served as Rhaenyra's Hand of the King during the Dance, and her first cousin once removed, Princess Rhaenys. She had three sons by him; Jacaerys Velaryon, Lucerys Velaryon, and Joffrey Velaryon. It was widely rumored by her opponents, however, that all three were actually bastards fathered by her lover, Harwin of House Strong. While this accusation was used as a political weapon, it is strongly suggested that there was some truth to it - though the matter is academic given that all three were definitely descended from the royal line through their mother, and it is irrelevant for later history because all three died without issue. Rhaenyra's second husband was actually her own uncle, Prince Daemon Targaryen, her father's younger brother. Daemon was a fierce and powerful warrior, and one of the most skilled and dangerous dragon-riders during the Dance. The two sons she bore to Daemon were Aegon and Viserys (who later became the Kings Aegon III and Viserys II). Rhaenyra's only daughter - carried during her final pregnancy - was stillborn; she named the dead girl, Visenya. The entire reason that Rhaenyra wasn't in King's Landing when her father died is because she was resting at Dragonstone eight months pregnant. However, when news reached the island that her half-brother had declared himself king in opposition to her, she became so distressed that she went into premature labor and her daughter was stillborn, as well as badly deformed (similar to Daenerys Targaryen's stillborn son Rhaego generations later). Rhaenyra blamed her brother and his supporters for causing the death of her daughter, adding further fuel to her hatred of them. Rhaenyra was also supported by Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, popularly known as \"the Queen Who Never Was\" due to that fact that she held a claim to the throne after her grandfather Jaehaerys I died, but her claim was ignored and the throne passed to her cousin Viserys I.","Later histories remember Rhaenyra as pampered and arrogant. She could be charming to those she liked, but was also quick to anger and never forgot a slight. However, this does not match contemporary accounts of her character \u2013 she was referred to as \"the Realm's Delight\" without irony in her youth \u2013 and her actions in the Dance of Dragons itself. By all accounts, she was the patient one, while Aegon II - a full decade younger than her - was still very much an impulsive young man. Rhaenyra actually benefited from years of training and experience at council, skills which Aegon II sorely lacked. When Rhaenyra first learned of the coup against her at King's Landing, she actually decided against making an immediate full scale assault against the capital, realizing she would have to be patient if she was to have any hope of winning back her throne. It is strongly implied that the reason Rhaenyra is remembered as arrogant is specifically because she was a woman who intended to rule in her own right, and she actually behaved no better or worse than a man would have in her position. The problem was that in the patriarchal society of Westeros, it was seen as improper for a woman to issue firm commands to men instead of behaving submissively; i.e. instead of behaving like Catelyn Stark, politely cajoling and urging male lords to do what she wanted, Rhaenyra assertively gave out orders in the manner Tywin Lannister or Brienne of Tarth would - good, sensible orders, but men were frequently offended that she did not behave submissively as a \"proper\" lady should.","During her life, Rhaenyra styled herself \"Rhaenyra of House Targaryen, First of Her Name\", but subsequent histories do not refer to her as \"Rhaenyra I\". Many felt that because Rhaenyra's own son Aegon III ended up succeeding to the throne, the dynastic claim of her faction was vindicated. However, at this point House Targaryen wanted to enforce the new strict male-preference primogeniture laws, under which the deceased Rhaenyra would never have inherited in the first place. Thus, even her own son could not retroactively consider his mother to have been the rightful ruler during the civil war. If her half-brother was not retroactively established as the lawful heir, Rhaenyra's son would have been crowned under the royal name \"Aegon II\" not \"Aegon III\", to reinforce that his uncle had not been the lawful heir. Because he couldn't do this and enforce the new strict male-preference primogeniture laws, her son had to take the name \"Aegon III\" and officially declare that his mother had only been a rival claimant, not the lawful heir.","The succession dispute and civil war between Rhaenyra and Aegon II is analogous to the Anarchy, a period in England during the early twelfth century. During this time, King Henry I's only surviving heir was his daughter Matilda. Like Rhaenyra, Matilda was quite pampered and arrogant; although she hadn't been raised as the heir apparent her whole life, after Henry I's son died in the White Ship disaster, Matilda was her father's only legitimate child. She was also the widow of the Holy Roman Emperor, one of the most powerful monarchs in Europe, and thus familiar with politics and rulership. Similar to Viserys I, Henry commanded the nobles of the realm to take oaths swearing they would support Matilda as his successor, but after Henry's death this began to crumble: Matilda's claim was challenged by her cousin Stephen of Blois, who was from a junior branch of the royal family but nonetheless usurped the throne by rushing to the capital to be crowned king. In the cases of both Rhaenyra\/Aegon II and Matilda\/Stephen, the resulting civil war wasn't really concerned with who the lawful heir was under different succession rights, but was truly a struggle between two major factions of nobles which had developed: those who currently enjoyed royal favor (under Rhaenyra and Matilda) and those who had not previously enjoyed royal favor (the supporters of Aegon II and Stephen). In both cases, the rival male claimant is historically considered the lawful ruler (Aegon II and Stephen), but the son of the female claimant (Rhaenyra and Matilda) ended up ruling after the male claimant's son had died (the succession of Aegon III and Henry II Plantagenet)."],"name":"Rhaenyra Targaryen","description":"Rhaenyra was a Queen of the Targaryen dynasty. She was the daughter of King Viserys I, and elder half-sister of King Aegon II, Queen Helaena, and Prince Aemond Targaryen. She was the mother of five sons, three by her first husband, Laenor Velaryon, who was also her cousin - Jacaerys Velaryon, Lucerys Velaryon, and Joffrey Velaryon. She later married her uncle, Daemon Targaryen, and two more sons, the future Kings Aegon III and Viserys II. Aegon III was himself the father of Kings Daeron I and Baelor, and Viserys II was the father of Aegon IV. Viserys I, having no sons by his first wife, Aemma Arryn, named Rhaenyra his heir, trained her how to rule and made the Lords of Westeros swear oaths to recognize her as his successor. However, he later remarried and had a son, Aegon. His death sparked a civil war between the half-siblings known as the Dance of Dragons.\n\nBased on the island of Dragonstone, Rhaenyra challenged Aegon's coronation, supported by her sons, husband, and the few Lords who had taken her side. Although greatly outnumbered, Rhaenyra had a powerful fleet and a large number of dragons at her disposal. Briefly ousting Aegon from King's Landing and crowning herself Rhaenyra I, she managed to take control of the North, the Riverlands and the Vale, but her support gradually eroded and her husband, as well as most of her children and dragons, were killed in battle. She eventually was defeated and Aegon II had his dragon devour her. However, her surviving son wedded Aegon's daughter and succeeded him as Aegon III.\n\nTouring the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing, King Joffrey Baratheon explains to Margaery Tyrell the fate of Rhaenyra Targaryen. Joffrey points out the crypts where what little is left of her is kept.\n\nAt her father's army camp in the North, Princess Shireen Baratheon reads a history book about the civil war between Aegon II and Rhaenyra: The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling by Grand Maester Munkun. When her father Stannis and Davos Seaworth ask about it, she explains that the conflict between Rhaenyra and Aegon II split the Seven Kingdoms in half. Shireen also specifies that Aegon was Rhaenyra's half-brother.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rhaenyra_Targaryen"}}

She was only 19 when she married Robert and became Queen. At first, Cersei was infatuated with the handsome Robert, but their love began to wane when he called her \"Lyanna\" on their wedding night. She nevertheless bore Robert a son who died shortly after his birth. Cersei was devastated by the loss of her son and refused to have the body taken from her, forcing Robert to hold her while they took her son from her. In time, Cersei's feelings for Robert turned to hatred and she returned to her brother as a result. Her three children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, are officially Robert's, but in reality are the products of her incestuous relationship with Jaime.","Cersei persuades Sansa to write a letter asking her brother Robb to bend the knee to Joffrey in return for her father's life. Sansa agrees, but the plan backfires, as the letter merely encourages Robb to raise an army and march into the Riverlands to confront the Lannister armies directly. In open court, Cersei encourages Sansa to make a new plea to Joffrey for her father's life. Joffrey agrees to spare him and let him join the Night's Watch, if Eddard recants the claims he has made about Joffrey not being the true king.","Cersei continues to govern from King's Landing as the Queen Regent to Joffrey. She is driven to defend Joffrey's claim in the face of several challengers in the War of the Five Kings. Facing imminent winter, she orders the city gates barred to prevent further refugees from entering the city. She is perturbed by the arrival of her brother Tyrion, who has been named acting Hand of the King by their father Tywin Lannister. She fears that Tyrion schemes to usurp her power and is frustrated when he tells her that since she failed to prevent the death of Eddard Stark, she has been viewed as the disappointing child by Tywin. Tyrion wins her temporary acceptance when he pledges to free Jaime from captivity, but insists that they need to find the fugitive Arya Stark in order to facilitate a prisoner exchange.","Later, Cersei visits Tyrion and rudely dismisses Podrick. She tells Tyrion that he should give Sansa a son if he truly wants to make her happy, though Tyrion responds by asking her if she is happy as she has children. Cersei admits that she is not happy, but would've thrown herself \"from the highest window in the Red Keep\" without them, even Joffrey. She recounts of how he was all she had before Myrcella was born and how she would spend hours looking at him, and acknowledges that he is one of the \"terrible ones\". Tyrion asks her when this will end, and Cersei replies when they have dealt with all their enemies. Tyrion mentions how dealing with one enemy creates two more, and she just says that they will be in this position for a long time.","Cersei is mourning Joffrey while Tywin arrives and immediately begins instructing Tommen on the qualities of a good king, much to her annoyance. After the two leave, Jaime arrives to comfort Cersei. She breaks down into tears and asks Jaime to avenge their son by killing Tyrion. Jaime is not convinced that Tyrion was behind the murder and tells Cersei that there will be a trial, but she does not care. He tries to comfort her through his affections. Cersei refuses initially, but Jaime is aggressive. Cersei insists that the sept during a private viewing of their son's corpse is a highly inappropriate place for sex, and asks Jaime to stop, saying \"It isn't right, it isn't right...\" and Jaime refuses to stop, saying, \"I don't care, I don't care...\". They proceed to embrace and have rough, angry sex on the floor next to Joffrey's corpse. ","She's finally back at Winterfell 'allying' herself with House Bolton. Cersei is naturally livid that the Boltons have betrayed her and vows that they'll end up being flayed for their crimes. Petyr then suggests that Cersei could just wait a while until Stannis has dealt with the Boltons or vice versa. The Vale army (under his command) could later easily mop up the remains. The only boon Littlefinger wants for his service is to be named Warden of the North. Cersei readily agrees on the condition that Baelish brings her Sansa's head.","She then orders Qyburn to place his spies all over Westeros to prevent any other Great Houses from benefiting from the Lannisters' disgrace. Cersei, Jaime and Gregor attend a Small Council meeting, but Kevan, Pycelle, Olenna and Mace Tyrell refuse to accept them, with Olenna coldly reminding Cersei that she is no longer Queen. When they defy the council and sit down, Kevan leads the council out, leaving Cersei alone with Jaime and Gregor.","Following her coronation, Cersei shows Jaime a giant map of Westeros and discusses the multiple foes they now face. While Cersei has dreams of ushering in a long dynasty, Jaime reminds her that they are losing the war, and with all their children dead, there is no Lannister line to inherit the Iron Throne. When Jaime asks Cersei about Tommen, she responds angrily that he betrayed them by committing suicide. Cersei adds that they are the only living Lannisters who count. Jaime tells her that they need allies and reports that House Frey has been exterminated. Cersei angrily reminds him that she has been listening to their father's counsel for the past forty years and has learnt some things.","Headey later revealed that the real reason she didn't do the nude scene herself is simply because she felt she wouldn't be able to stay in-character: Cersei is supposed to make the entire penance walk with an utterly stoic face, but Headey felt she could not restrain herself from emoting (as extras also fling filth and insults at her) - not that she felt she would start crying, but rather, that she felt she couldn't restrain herself from reacting angrily, glaring at the crowd, when it is explicitly important that the character doesn't react. Her second pregnancy actually had nothing to do with the decision because that happened later.","Tywin does plan to find a new husband for Cersei, though not Loras Tyrell, who has been made a Kingsguard after the Battle of the Blackwater. Willas Tyrell, Mace's eldest son and heir who is not in the TV series, is Tywin's first choice. However, Olenna Tyrell vetoes the match in revenge for the Lannisters foiling her plot to marry Sansa Stark to Willas. Prince Oberyn Martell is also suggested as a match. Cersei never threatens her father with revealing Tommen's true parentage if she is forced to re-marry."],"name":"Cersei Lannister","description":"Cersei is ruthless, willful, cold, ambitious, and cunning in the sense that she is utterly willing to betray anyone who trusts her, or do anything to protect her own. However, she is also arrogant and self-centered to a fault. While she certainly believes herself to be a master strategist, she is extremely impatient, short-sighted, and prone to displays of poor judgment and poor leadership, resulting in her being both unskilled at manipulating enemies who openly distrust her and incapable of thinking about the long-term consequences of her actions. Cersei's own father Tywin stated to her that he distrusts her because she isn't nearly as intelligent as she believes herself to be. This makes for a dangerous combination, as not only is Cersei not as intelligent as she thinks, but she does not even realize her own limitations.\n\nShe is not completely devoid of tact. Despite their blatant attempt to deceive her and collect the reward on her brother, Cersei opts not to punish a pair of bounty hunters to avoid discouraging the other hunters from finding Tyrion and acknowledges that mistakes will be made.\n\nCersei's schemes may work initially, but they have a tendency to backfire on her. She was partially successful in her scheme to have Ned Stark falsely confess to treason before exiling him to the Wall in order to keep the North and the Riverlands in line. However, she failed to predict that Joffrey would be so foolish as to start a war by having Ned executed instead. Her scheme to undermine the Tyrells' plot to marry Loras to Sansa backfires on her when Tywin insists that Cersei will marry Loras instead, and coerces the Tyrells into consenting by threatening to have Loras appointed to the Kingsguard if they don't. After Tywin's death, she thinks she can co-opt the Sparrows into undermining the Tyrells, which briefly succeeds by having Loras and then Margaery imprisoned by the Faith Militant, but this plan ultimately backfired on her as well when she too was imprisoned and force to perform a walk of atonement. In this particular case, the combination of Cersei's own ego, as well as her belief that the Sparrows were loyal to her alone, did not allow her to comprehend that the same tactics she used against the Tyrells could also be used against her. Finally, Cersei's plan to destroy the Faith Militant and the Tyrells backfires on her as well with the suicide of Tommen, her last living child.\n\nA mistake outsiders often make when dealing with Cersei is assuming that she has the emotional maturity and wisdom of a queen, or at least an adult, when her real personality is closer to a petulant child inhabiting an adult's body (indeed, Lena Headey has stated that she plays Cersei as having the mind of a wayward 15 year old who never had any real parenting). With her mother dead at a young age and her father away at court (and a cold disciplinarian anyway), Cersei was functionally raised by servants. In public, Cersei often tries to exude a sense of calm and regal control over her surroundings. When things do not go her own way, however, Cersei's usual response is to become childishly flippant, even when the assembled Small Council is trying to give her advice which would genuinely serve her own interests. She also has a tendency to irrationally blame other people for problems she actually started herself though her ego won't let her admit otherwise.\n\nCersei's behavior is very mercurial, capable of switching between seemingly true affection for someone to extreme loathing over trifles. She is very petty about even small slights, both real and imagined, which ended up being her undoing, for she tried to use the Faith Militant to undermine House Tyrell due to her dislike of Margaery and the fact she replaced her as Queen, only to lose House Tyrell as an ally and find a powerful enemy in the Faith Militant. As Tyrion noted, Cersei often uses her honest feelings to dishonestly manipulate other people. For example, her fear for the safety of her children is actually genuine, but she will shamelessly use this to play on the sympathy of other people, to sway them into supporting her.\n\nCersei despises the restraints placed on her because she is a woman and is jealous of the freedoms that men have in her society. Several of the noble Houses in the Seven Kingdoms have more liberal attitudes when it comes to involving female members of their family in politics. The women of House Tyrell, for example, are expected to be involved in politics and have thus been trained from a young age in the skills of ruling. Unfortunately, Cersei's father Tywin is a staunch conservative, and never envisioned Cersei playing an active role in politics. Instead, her duty was to cement a marriage alliance and raise royal children, nothing more. It is also possible that instead of her gender being the object, Tywin believes she is simply too impatient and rash. Either way, the practical result is that, right or wrong, Tywin didn't raise Cersei to be skilled in ruling or in political intrigue. While confronted with these shortfalls, Cersei often blames her father or society in general for not giving her the years of training needed to rule, but complaining about it doesn't change the fact that she simply doesn't possess these skills. Cersei hates being a woman in Westerosi society, and scorns other women in general for what she perceives as their weakness: Cersei isn't so much angry at men for mistreating women, as angry that she isn't a man. When she was drunk during the Battle of the Blackwater she even openly said she wished she was born a man.\n\nCersei's lack of a parental relationship growing up is reflected in how poorly she has served as a mother to her own children, for whom she is unable to act as a stable moral instructor. While she certainly dotes on them, she doesn't genuinely \"love\" them so much as she treats them as extensions of herself. She is convinced that she is obsessed with their welfare, but when events threaten to take any of them away from her she is not so much worried about their happiness and well-being as angered that something she feels belongs to her is being taken away.\n\nTyrion once observed that Cersei's love for her children is her one obvious redeeming quality - but she even managed to twist this into a negative. Cersei doesn't really \"love\" her children so much as she is obsessed with her mental constructs of them. She spent Joffrey's entire childhood convinced that he was going to grow up to be the best king ever, wise and brave - to the point that she blinded herself to his obviously psychopathic behaviour. However, in spite of her obvious favoritism and far from realistic conception of her son, she at least acknowledged that Joffrey was indeed a monster after his death, implying she wasn't as deluded as she appeared. Her overindulgence of Joffrey also spoiled him rotten, filling him with an insatiable sense of entitlement - nor did he particularly give her much respect in return. Meanwhile, Cersei seems oblivious to the fact that she ignored her two younger children, Myrcella and Tommen. While Cersei is constantly upset that her own father Tywin played favorites with his children and focused all of his attention on her brother Jaime, she hypocritically visited the same treatment on her own children. She fixated on Joffrey so much that she barely knew Myrcella and Tommen, rarely engaging them in conversation except when she needed to manipulate them. After Myrcella was sent away to Dorne in a marriage-alliance, Cersei assumed she was suffering away from her family, not suspecting that Myrcella would actually find happiness once she was free from Cersei's control and not even want to come back to her. After spending some years in Dorne away from her, Myrcella outright said that Cersei doesn't even know her. Finally, after the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei tells a captured Unella, she was motivated by protecting her last living child, Tommen. However, Cersei once again proves what a poor parent she is by not going immediately to Tommen after his wife is killed in the explosion and preventing his suicide as she was too preoccupied with paying back Unella for imprisoning and humiliating her.\n\nAfter she was humiliated by the Faith Militant, the megalomania and vengefulness Cersei possessed all her life reached its peak. Combined with the rage she felt for her Uncle Kevan and the fact that Olenna Tyrell and Grand Maester Pycelle deprived her of power, Cersei began plotting with Qyburn to avoid her trial, simultaneously destroy her enemies, including the High Sparrow and Queen Margaery. This ended up destroying the alliance with the Tyrells, the only effective ally to King's Landing and a bloody revolt is to be expected by a vindictive Olenna. Cersei, however, does not seem concerned regarding this, displaying much more recklessness and slight mental imbalance on her part. Despite declaring herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, the title is effectively meaningless as currently the only major houses supporting her are her own and the Freys, although with the death of Walder Frey as well as the Freys' apparent military incompetence, they are unlikely to be useful allies. Along with the Lannisters now pitted against the rest of the great houses of Westeros, there is also the matter of the Crown's debt to the Iron Bank which has still not been resolved. So while Cersei might have achieved her ultimate ambition of being crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, she is still in an incredibly precarious situation. However, this appears lost on her, further demonstrating her inability to see the far-reaching consequences of her actions.\n\nBeforehand, Cersei was known to have an extremely thinly-veiled sense of morality, which can be attributed to her love for her own children, no matter how twisted it was. Now that Tommen, Joffrey and Myrcella are all dead, however, Cersei has begun displaying more ruthlessness and depravity in her convictions. Her use of wildfire to destroy the Great Sept of Baelor can be considered somewhat of a symbolic envoi to her own descent into the same level of tyranny as the the Mad King. This act also destroyed the area surrounding the Great Sept for half a mile, effectively murdering hundreds of innocent people. Ironically, this may serve to drive a wedge between her and Jaime; Jaime outright said that the only thing he cares about is Cersei and that he was willing to kill even children if it reunited them, but Cersei has committed an act similar to the one he had to kill the Mad King for. Jaime's grim look upon returning to King's Landing and witnessing her coronation means that he understands that she is becoming exactly like him.\n\nRegarding her own crimes, Cersei appears to have become shamelessly sadistic. She outwardly admits that all her actions from having Robert killed to having an incestuous relationship with Jaime was solely because she enjoyed doing so. This, she \"confesses\" to a helpless Unella while vengefully playing with her, even quietly chanting \"shame\" (in a similar sense that Unella did during her walk of atonement) before leaving her to be tortured by Gregor Clegane.\n\nAll of this points to another mistake outsiders often make, Ned Stark for example, when dealing with Cersei as Olenna Tyrell noted before her death: failure to imagine just how far Cersei is willing to go to keep her power.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cersei_Lannister"}}

Sansa coolly declares that she is a Stark and Winterfell is her home: she refuses to be scared and nothing Myranda says will intimidate her. Silently fuming but unable to retaliate, Myranda asks if she is still needed. Sansa dismisses her. She is later present at Ramsay and Sansa's wedding, again looking on with jealousy as they are married.","Myranda's body is found and Ramsay pays his respects to her corpse. He remembers how they met when she was only eleven and that from the very start she never showed fear towards him. He appears somewhat saddened over her death and ends his eulogy with a promise of revenge to the people who killed her but then proceeds to casually tell Maester Wolkan to feed her body to the dogs, so as not to waste her flesh. Despite his promise to avenge her, Ramsay is ultimately defeated in combat by Jon Snow and also fed to the dogs.","* Only appears as a corpse.","Sour Alyn and Grunt are on guard at the door of Ramsay's bedchamber when Theon and the spearwives come there to rescue Jeyne. The two thugs suspect nothing. While walking away, Theon muses that Ramsay will punish Alyn and Grunt very severely for allowing his wife to escape, probably by flaying. It is unknown what Ramsay actually did to them."],"name":"Myranda","description":"Myranda was a cruel, wily girl with an uncontrollable sadistic streak and sexual urges, which induces a combination thereof, especially throughout the way she assists in the torture of Bolton prisoners, making her equally as wild and sociopathic as her lover, Ramsay. Myranda was deceitful, able to use her sexuality and soft-spoken demeanor to lull victims into a false sense of security before revealing her true nature. Seemingly shy, she does not rage or openly express, but has a perverse pleasure from mutilating or murdering helpless victims.\n\nA noticeable personality trait of Myranda, aside from this, is her jealous nature, especially when it comes to Ramsay, whom she has become extremely possessive over. Such behavior was also displayed when she forced herself upon the imprisoned Theon Greyjoy but grows rather frustrated when he pays more attention to Violet than with her and how she ran down another of Ramsay's lovers, Tansy through the woods with a pack of dogs but states she was jealous of her presence, bitterly preparing to shoot an arrow through her face because \"she thinks she's pretty\". This was seen specifically with Sansa Stark, who became wed to Ramsay, like many others such as Shae and Lysa Arryn, Myranda grew envious over her highborn status and great beauty, repeatedly making threats against her life and threatening to mutilate her before her death.\n\nDespite her sociopathic ways, Myranda does seem to genuinely care about Ramsay, even if he only saw her as a thing to entertain him and was willing to abandon her if she grew boring. She was naive enough, however, to believe him when he said the two would marry one day. This may suggest her feelings for him may be love, or simply misinterpreted as lust. Nevertheless, the relationship is not entirely black-and-white as Ramsay kept her around longer than most of his bedwarmers and even gave a eulogy, vowing revenge on those who killed her before telling Maester Wolkan to feed her corpse to the dogs.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Myranda"}}

He was the father of Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and the older brother of Euron, and Aeron \"Damphair\" Greyjoy.","Balon was married to Alannys of House Harlaw. They had four children Rodrik, Maron, Yara and Theon. Yara is their only daughter.  Eight years before the start of the series Balon declared himself King of the Iron Islands and rose in the rebellion against the Iron Throne to revive the \"Old Way\", which had once led the ironborn to rule much of the western coast of Westeros. However, he was shown to only listen to the stories of the Old Way and did not live by them. He was, however, defeated in a bloody war. His elder two sons were killed and his third son, Theon, was taken by Lord Eddard Stark as a hostage for Balon's good behavior and obedience. Yara has remained on the Iron Islands and has become a warrior and captain in her own right, which is unusual for women on the isles.","While visiting Winterfell, Tyrion Lannister asks Theon what his father would think if he could see his only surviving son 'playing lackey' to Robb Stark. Theon angrily defends himself, but Tyrion seems to gain the upper hand of the exchange. Later, Theon tells Ros about his father's power and that no family in Westeros, not even the Lannisters, can look down at them. However, Maester Luwin mocks Theon's father's failed rebellion when Theon's boasting gets a little out of hand. When Theon tries to get Osha to call him 'Lord', she points out his father is still alive, so he isn't a lord yet, to Theon's annoyance.","After the Starks, under Robb Stark's leadership, win several victories against the Lannister army, Theon reminds Robb that they will need to take King's Landing in order to defeat the Lannisters for good, and proposes an alliance between the Starks and his father, who can provide them with ships, though he seems rather uncertain while promising that Balon will listen to him.","Balon receives a letter and a box from Ramsay in the name of his father, Roose Bolton, the acting Warden of the North. The letter explains that Ramsay is holding Balon's son and heir, Theon Greyjoy, and that unless Balon withdraws his troops from the North and returns all occupied territories Ramsay will continue sending pieces of Theon. The box is found to contain Theon's severed penis. Though visibly saddened at what has become of his last surviving son, Balon dismisses the terms, telling Yara that Theon disobeyed his orders and that he can no longer further the Greyjoy line, making him useless and as good as dead. Yara openly defies her father, however, and tells him that she will take a longship and the strongest warriors on Pyke to go and rescue her brother from the Boltons.","On Ramsay's orders, Theon later treats with the Ironborn at Moat Cailin and persuades them to surrender peacefully as Balon once did to Robert Baratheon after his failed rebellion.","In an attempt to reach out to Theon, Sansa Stark reminds him of his real name and position as Balon's only surviving son and heir.","Balon and Yara learn that Deepwood Motte, the only remaining Ironborn-occupied castle in the North, has been retaken by House Glover, essentially marking the end of their occupation in the North. Balon, however, refuses to relent, and vows to send more troops to take back the Northern lands and castles they have lost, and chides Yara for wasting some of their best men in her failed attempt to rescue Theon from the Boltons, despite Yara reminding Balon that his arrogance cost them the lives of her two older brothers and countless men when he rebelled against Robert Baratheon. Balon then storms out in blinding rain and crosses a bridge separating two towers of Pyke, where he is confronted by his younger brother, Euron, whom he exiled years ago and believed to have died.

It is heavily implied that Euron was responsible, given his return to the Iron Islands very shortly after Balon's death. In a released sample chapter from The Winds of Winter, Euron admits to a drugged Aeron that he did murder Balon (though not by his own hands - implying that he has hired an assassin), as well as two more of their brothers. Unlike in the show, Euron does not admit that in public."],"name":"Balon Greyjoy","description":"Balon Greyjoy was shown to be a stubborn, unyielding man who often had difficulty seeing past his own desires. Despite his spectacular defeat in his failed uprising, he still leapt at the first opportunity to invade Westeros again, all out of sheer ambition to revive the Old Way. This stubbornness greatly affected Balon\u2019s relationship with his son, and to some degree his daughter; he treated Theon rather coldly when the latter returned to Pyke, and when Theon pointed out that it was his father\u2019s failed rebellion that caused his son to be taken as a hostage in the first place, Balon refused to admit any personal fault. His hatred for the Starks was so great that he planned to attack the North while Robb was away, despite Theon's warning that if they did so, they would eventually be thrown out, either by Robb winning and retaking the North, or the Lannisters winning and throwing the Greyjoys out. After Deepwood Motte was retaken by the Glovers, and Yara pointed out that future invasion attempts would produce no lasting results, Balon essentially said that he didn't care about results, only that the ironborn followed his orders. This pushed Yara to angrily remind her father that his unflagging adherence to the Old Way had led to the deaths of his two elder sons (and again to Theon becoming a hostage of the Starks), which Balon did not appreciate.\n\nHowever, deep down, Balon was shown to love his family to a certain degree; he showed true affection for Yara and allowed her to become a warrior and ship\u2019s captain in her own right, something highly unusual for a man so defined by tradition. He also seemed genuinely embittered by the loss of Rodrik and Maron, as well as by Theon being taken away from him, and outwardly admitted that Theon becoming like the Starks was something he feared. He appeared genuinely saddened at Theon's capture and emasculation by the Boltons and opted to allow Theon to be tortured further and possibly killed instead of letting him live a life of shame.\n\nThrough dialogue, however, it is clear that Balon did not have an amicable relationship with his brother, Euron Greyjoy. His first reaction to Euron's return was to brandish a knife and attempt to kill him, which would constitute kinslaying, though their dialogue implies that Euron has gone insane and Balon's actions were in self-defense.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Balon_Greyjoy"}}

They played hide-and-seek in the grove, where Elaena would always hide behind the same tree so Rodrik would find her.\n\nElaena Glenmore arrives at Ironrath after hearing Rodrik survived the Red Wedding to discuss their betrothal. While happy to see him, she soon reveals that her family is having second thoughts about the betrothal. Based on the player's choice of discourse, she either decides to go ahead with the betrothal, or call it off as it's too dangerous.\n\nIf Mira had forged a note to Elaena from Margaery Tyrell, Elaena will feel like she's being coerced into marrying Rodrik, but can be convinced by allowing her to make her own choice. Alternatively, if Mira did not forge the letter, Rodrik can offer half of the Forresters' ironwood to satisfy the Glenmores.  After their discussion, Lord Ludd Whitehill rudely enters. He asks if Elaena is still marrying Rodrik, arguing that his son, Gryff, still needs a wife. Depending on whether or not the betrothal was won, Elaena will either proudly affirm that she is marrying Rodrik, or say that she has not yet reached a decision. After Ludd demands Rodrik kiss his ring, Elaena will either (depending on player choice) express relief that Rodrik didn't show weakness, or disappointment for him showing weakness.\n\nElaena appears in the Ironwood Grove while Royland and Rodrik are training to fight despite his injured leg. She appears with her brother Arthur and the Glenmore Elite Guard. She tells Rodrik that the betrothal between them (if it was secured) will not carry on due to Ludd Whitehill paying Elaena's father a visit and convincing him to have Elaena Glenmore marry Gryff Whitehill. Her brother Arthur is also shocked by Lord Glenmore accepting the offer and says that the Glenmore Elite Guard is Rodrik's if Gryff is taken down. Rodrik can promise Elaena to kill Gryff or not, either way -- you aren't able to.  Elaena asks everyone else to give them some privacy. Rodrik can choose to kiss her or say farewell. Later on, Elaena, Rodrik, Arthur and the Elite Guard go inside the Great Hall, and Rodrik tells them to come out when he strikes his cane. Gryff questions why Elaena is here and she claims she'd rather marry a dead horse. She stands there and watches as Rodrik beats Gryff or does nothing, saying Gryff looks like he 'wants more' if Rodrik hesitates. When Lady Forrester stops Rodrik, she accepts and says it's okay not to kill Gryff right now. It is assumed she stayed at Ironrath when Rodrik, Royland\/Duncan, Elissa and possibly the Glenmore Elite Guard head to Highpoint.\n\nElaena appears after her brother Arthur is killed by Ramsay Snow. She comes to the ironwood grove looking for Arthur, and becomes distraught upon seeing his body. Blaming herself for getting him involved, Elaena explains to Rodrik how, when he was first learning to use a bow, he shook so much that his father gave him the nickname \"Quiver.\" She accuses Rodrik of causing his death, but quickly apologizes and continues to sob. Rodrik can either offer to keep her company or give her some time alone, saying that she can stay at Ironrath for as long as she wants. \n\nIf Rodrik offered to keep Elaena company, she is later seen in his bed. They imply that they've been sleeping together for several weeks, and talk about what the future holds for them. If Rodrik tells her to return to her family, Elaena says that she can never go back, as she worries that her father will blame her for Arthur's death. Talia then interrupts their conversation with important information for Rodrik. Embarassed, Elaena covers herself with a sheet and exits the room.\n\nIf Rodrik is killed in the Ambush at the Harbor, Elaena is present when Asher arrives at Ironrath. Upon learning of Rodrik's death, she and Talia hold each other and cry for him. When Asher later begins discussing what to do about the Whitehills, Elaena angrily states that they've lost the war with Rodrik's death. Asher's sentinel backs up her claim, saying that under Ramsay's terms, his death means that the Whitehills have won.\n\nElaena later joins the rest of the Forrester household in meeting Ludd Whitehill and his army at the gates of Ironrath. After demanding Asher's surrender, Ludd returns Rodrik's body as a token of his goodwill. Elaena gives the corpse of her lover a brief, mournful look before walking away. She is not seen for the rest of the episode, leaving it unknown as to whether she escaped the Battle of Ironrath or was captured by the Whitehills.\n\nIf Rodrik survived the ambush, Elaena happily greets him when he returns to Ironrath. She stands by as he convinces the pit fighters to stay loyal to him and rallies the smallfolk to prepare for battle.  As the Whitehill army lays siege to Ironrath, Elaena initially stays hidden in the cellars with Talia. At some point, Maester Ortengryn advises her to flee the castle to House Glenmore's cousins in the Riverlands. Elaena confronts Rodrik and asks him to allow her to stay at his side. Rodrik can demand that she leave for her own safety, or allow her to stay. She then wishes Rodrik good luck as he goes to infiltrate the Whitehill camp.\n\nDespite the Forresters' best efforts, Ironrath eventually falls to the Whitehills. If Elaena was allowed to stay, she is captured by Whitehill soldiers and dragged out of the castle. A heavily wounded Rodrik sees this and attempts to help her, but is unable to muster the strength to move, leaving her fate unknown.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Elaena_Glenmore"}}

Often referred to as \"Tywin Lannister's mad dog\", Gregor has an insatiable bloodlust that he releases through acts of extreme violence. He is quick to anger and never shows any fear of acting on it, since no one dares stop him. One of the only people he has ever shown any loyalty or respect toward is Tywin; when not actively obeying Tywin's orders he mostly acts of his own accord, showing even little respect toward King Robert Baratheon after he was told to stop his fit of rage at the Tourney of The Hand. Gregor is also loyal to Qyburn and Cersei, following the experiments performed on him to prevent his death. His violent personality had even manifested as a child, quickly becoming known for his strength, size, and brutality. Gregor even burned his own brother's face when they were children simply for playing with one of Gregor's toys. Tywin suggests that Gregor is also an alcoholic, when instructing Arya Stark to keep Gregor from getting drunk.","When Sandor is told by Joffrey to escort Sansa back to the Red Keep after the tournament feast he tells her the story of how his face was burned (not Littlefinger as happens in the TV series). A wood carver gave toys to both of the Clegane children in order to gain their father's patronage. Sandor wanted the articulated jointed knight that Gregor got so he took it. Gregor was ten and already big enough to be training so he didn't even care about the toy, but when he found six year old Sandor playing with it without warning he pushed Sandor's head into a brazier and held him there. It took three men to get Sandor away from him and their father told people that Sandor's bed linens had caught fire. It was later when Gregor was anointed a knight that Sandor Clegane lost all respect for the institution of knighthood and has steadfastly refused to be knighted himself.","After Loras is sent to resolve the siege of Dragonstone, Qyburn tells Cersei that in case Loras dies, she will need to find another worthy for the Kingsguard. He claims \"I had another sort of champion in mind. What he lacks in gallantry he will give you tenfold in devotion. He will protect your son, kill your enemies, and keep your secrets, and no living man will be able to withstand him\".

Gregor is a landed knight rather than a full-fledged lord. Gregor is monstrously huge, said to be the largest man in Westeros. He is feared throughout Westeros with a reputation for ferocity and anger. He is a loyal retainer and servant of House Lannister, particularly to Lord Tywin.\n\nNumerous servants have gone missing at the Clegane keep over the years, apparently killed by Gregor for minor slights in one of his infamous fits of rage, and their deaths then covered up. Gregor's own father and sister died under dubious circumstances as well, and Sandor thinks that Gregor may have killed them as well. Their sister died when Sandor was too young to remember her well, and their father died years later in what was said to be a \"hunting accident\". At the request of Tywin Lannister, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen himself anointed Gregor as a knight, a great honor, even though Gregor was an infamously dishonorable man.\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, one year after Prince Rhaegar knighted him, Gregor participated in the Sack of King's Landing. After entering the Red Keep he viciously killed Rhaegar's two children by Elia Martell: their daughter Rhaenys and baby Aegon. He killed baby Aegon by bashing his head against the wall, and then while still covered in the gore from her children proceeded to rape Elia, after which he killed her. It is rumored that he killed her by cutting her in half with a single swing of his massive sword, although he later claimed to have \"smashed her head in\".\n\nDespite pleas by Ned Stark, neither Gregor nor Tywin were punished by King Robert for the murders of the royal family, leading to a rift in Ned and Robert's friendship.\n\nSer Gregor takes part in the tournament to celebrate Eddard Stark's appointment as Hand of the King. He kills Ser Hugh of the Vale in a joust, horrifying the crowd. Littlefinger tells Sansa Stark that Gregor burned his brother Sandor's face over a naked flame when they were boys because Sandor borrowed one of his toys without asking. He tells her that few people know the story and not to let Sandor Clegane know that she does. When Gregor faces Ser Loras Tyrell, he loses the joust because Loras chose to ride a mare that was in heat to distract Gregor's stallion. Flying into a rage, Gregor demands his sword, then ruthlessly decapitates his erstwhile mount before the entire horrified crowd. Ignoring his surroundings, he continues to knock the surprised Loras off his horse, and is on the verge of dishonorably killing him, when his brother Sandor intervenes, fighting him off to protect Loras. The two brothers violently trade swings with their swords, and Gregor only stops when King Robert himself shouts to stop the fight, at which the incredibly enraged Ser Gregor stops and leaves.\n\nCatelyn Stark takes Tyrion Lannister into custody on suspicion of the attempted assassination of her son Bran. In response Gregor is dispatched to raid the Riverlands, her homeland. Refugees from the Riverlands attend court in King's Landing and report that a huge knight who could take the head of a horse in one blow led the attack and had sacked their villages. Littlefinger asks \"Remind you of someone?\" Eddard Stark sends Ser Beric Dondarrion with a hundred men to bring Gregor to justice. Eddard declares him a false knight and strips him of all ranks and titles, lands and holdings, and sentences him to death. The ruling is made null by Eddard's arrest for treason and subsequent beheading.\n\nThe host led by Lord Beric clashes against Ser Gregor at the Mummer's Ford. Ser Gregor is victorious, and Lord Beric is reported dead.\n\nHowever, when Robb Stark's victory against Jaime Lannister forces Lord Tywin to withdraw his forces to Harrenhal, he orders Ser Gregor to take five hundred men and \"set the Riverlands on fire\" from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.\n\nGregor continues to raid the villages of the Riverlands from the Lannister army's base at Harrenhal. His men torture the prisoners they take for information about the Brotherhood and hidden valuables. He selects the prisoners for torture personally. Ser Amory Lorch adds a group of captured Night's Watch recruits to the captives. Lord Tywin Lannister arrives during the torture and asks Gregor what is going on. Gregor says that they were not expecting Tywin for another day. Tywin asks why the prisoners are not in their cells. Gregor says that their cells are overflowing. One of Lorch's men interjects that the prisoners will not be there long. Tywin asks if they are so well manned that they can afford to discard able and skilled prisoners. He asks a prisoner if he has a trade and learns that he is a smith. Tywin orders the prisoners put to work, sparing the young man. When the Ironborn under the command of Theon Greyjoy attack Torrhen\u2019s Square, to lure the remaining Stark forces away from Winterfell, Ser Rodrik Cassel assumes that it could be a raiding party led by Ser Gregor.Following the assassination of Ser Amory just outside Lord Tywin's chamber, Ser Gregor is tasked with finding the culprit. Tywin fears that he was the intended target and has Ser Gregor hang over 20 of their own men. Ser Gregor suggests that an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners was responsible and Lord Tywin dispatches him to pressure the smallfolk of the Riverlands into giving up the members of the Brotherhood. Tywin marches back to the Westerlands and leaves Gregor to serve as castellan at Harrenhal.\n\nRobb Stark and his army get to Harrenhal, finding that Gregor Clegane has left the castle with his men. To their horror, they discover that Ser Gregor has executed the remaining 200 Northmen and Rivermen prisoners at Harrenhal, leaving their bodies to rot.\n\nSer Gregor is later expelled from Stone Mill by a force led by Robb's uncle, Lord Edmure Tully, forcing him to flee south to Casterly Rock. However, Robb chides his uncle for his actions, explaining that he wanted to draw the Mountain into the west where they could kill him.\n\nOberyn Martell discusses with Tyrion Lannister how the last time he was in King's Landing, it was for the wedding of his sister Elia to Rhaegar Targaryen. He also states that during the Sack of King's Landing, his sister was raped and murdered by Gregor. Oberyn believes that Tyrion's father, Tywin, was the one to give the order to the Mountain. He tells Tyrion that he intends to avenge her.\n\n\u200BPolliver tells Gregor's brother when meeting in a tavern further north, that while loyal to the Mountain and the Lannisters, Polliver wasn't in agreement with Gregor's torturous methods because they were repetitive and boring. When Tyrion Lannister demands a trial by combat, Gregor is quickly appointed the Crown's champion by Queen Cersei Lannister in order to deter anyone from fighting for Tyrion. Tyrion first asks his brother Jaime to fight for him, but he declines, saying that he simply cannot fight like he used to with the loss of his sword hand. Tyrion then asks his friend Bronn to be his champion, but he too refuses, arguing that the Mountain is an incredibly dangerous fighter, one that would cost him his life if he makes a single mistake. Finally, Prince Oberyn Martell approaches Tyrion and volunteers to be his champion, as he wants to avenge his sister. \n\nGregor fights Oberyn at Tyrion's trial by combat, wielding heavy plated armor and a large broad sword with one arm. Despite his immense size and strength, he is no match for Oberyn's swift and agile fighting style. Oberyn manages to knock Gregor's helmet off early into the duel and proceeds \u200Bto slowly cut The Mountain down, all the while taunting him and demanding him to admit to the rape and murder of Elia Martell and her children, chanting \"you raped her; you murdered her; you killed her children\". Oberyn eventually severs \u200BClegane's hamstring, causing him to fall to his knees. Oberyn proceeds by jumping and thrusting his spear into Gregor's chest, severely injuring the gigantic man and seemingly sealing his defeat. Thinking his opponent is fully incapacitated, Oberyn removes his spear from Gregor's chest and circles him, refusing to initiate the killing blow until Gregor has admitted to Elia's death and revealed who orchestrated it, directing his gaze accusingly at Tywin.\n\nHowever, in his hubris, Oberyn is unexpectedly caught off guard when Gregor trips and pulls him to the ground, grasping him around the neck and slamming his fist squarely into his face, instantly knocking out many of Oberyn's teeth. Berserk with fury at nearly being killed by his opponent, Gregor pins Oberyn to the ground and proceeds to gouge out his eyeballs, making him scream in agony, as he roars for all to hear, \"Elia Martell! I killed her children! Then I raped her! Then I smashed her head...in like this!\"\n\nHe then crushes Oberyn's skull, making his paramour Ellaria Sand scream in horror. Gregor collapses beside his fallen opponent from the wounds he sustained as Tywin announces that, according to the rules of trial by combat, Oberyn's death has officially sealed the fate of Tyrion Lannister and sentences him to death.\n\nDespite his exceedingly gruesome death, Oberyn nonetheless manages to get some posthumous revenge. Before the duel, Oberyn had his spears coated with manticore venom, one of the deadliest poisons in the known world. The venom causes his wounds to start putrefying, emitting an overpowering stench, and with dead flesh sloughing off and as a final torture, the venom forces him to remain conscious during the whole ordeal. Even Grand Maester Pycelle regretfully tells Queen Cersei that Ser Gregor is beyond any hope of healing. Qyburn, however, an expelled former maester with extensive medical knowledge gained from \"repugnant\" and \"unnatural\" experimentation on living people, suggests that he may be able to save him. Cersei dismisses Pycelle and gives Qyburn permission to do anything he can to save Ser Gregor (likely out of gratitude for sealing Tyrion's fate and her revenge on him for the death of Joffrey), though he says that his unorthodox methods may \"change\" him. She nervously asks if he means the process will weaken Gregor, but Qyburn knowingly assures her it will not.\n\nA moribund Gregor Clegane is being experimented on by Qyburn at his laboratory in the dungeons below the Red Keep. Queen Cersei visits Qyburn and asks him about the state of his work, while glancing at Gregor's covered body, and Qyburn assures her it is going very well, though there is still a way to go. Then, Gregor suddenly spasms, and Qyburn gently shushes him and tells him to go easy. During Cersei's imprisonment by the Faith, Qyburn reminds her that \"the work continues.\"\n\nAfter Cersei's walk of atonement, she returns to the Keep where Qyburn covers her up and is pleased to introduce the \"newest member\" of the Kingsguard. The Mountain stands as tall as ever, fully covered in Kingsguard plate armor. Only his reddened eyes, surrounded by pale blueish flesh, are visible through his helmet. With Cersei's feet injured and bleeding, he is instructed to carry her. As he does so, Qyburn informs Cersei that he has taken a holy vow of silence to last until all of Tommen's enemies are dead and the evil has been driven from the world.\n\nGregor is present standing guard over Cersei when Jaime returns with their daughter's body.\n\nLater, Gregor continues to serve Cersei without question. He finds a man who boasts of having flashed his penis at Cersei during her walk and bashes his head against a wall, killing him.\n\nBack at the Red Keep, he accompanies Cersei when she attempts to attend Myrcella's funeral, only to be stopped by a group of Lannister soldiers, who have arrived to prevent her from leaving on King Tommen's orders. Although Gregor intimidates the captain with his size, Cersei acquiesces, and he escorts her back to her room.\n\nGregor follows Cersei and Jaime into Qyburn's laboratory, where the former Maester is trying to win the service of the Little Birds by offering them candied plums from Dorne; the children are extremely frightened by the towering knight and quickly flee the room. Jaime asks what Qyburn has done to Gregor, to which the latter replies with \"a number of things\". Jaime wonders whether Gregor is able to understand complete sentences, to which the huge knight menacingly turns his head towards Jaime. Qyburn assures that Gregor understands well enough. Jaime suggests sending Ser Gregor to the High Septon to crush him and his Faith Militants. Cersei disagrees, saying they can't let Ser Gregor face them all and that he only needs to face one, implying the coming Trial by Combat.\n\nAt the Small Council, Pycelle expresses his disgusts about Qyburn's treatment of Ser Gregor, calling him an abomination. He attempts to suggest that it would be in everyone's best interest to have the \"beast\" destroyed, but he is cut short when he becomes aware of the presence of Cersei, Jaime and Gregor himself. Frightened by the huge man in shining armor, Pycelle cannot keep himself from passing gas. Kevan argues that Cersei and Jaime have no position on the Small Council, but Jaime replies by saying the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard has. Cersei suggests the Small Council gets on with urgent matters, as they cannot make them leave. Kevan replies that Cersei and Jaime cannot make them stay either, unless they set Gregor to kill them. As everyone except Cersei and Jaime leave, Pycelle cowers past Ser Gregor, who coldly looks back.\n\nAfter Cersei got word of Olenna Tyrell's intention to return to Highgarden, she confronts her. Ser Gregor Clegane follows in the Queen Mother's wake and silently stands guard behind her.\n\nWhen Lancel and several other members of the Faith Militant enter the Red Keep, Cersei, Qyburn and Ser Gregor arrive to confront them. Lancel tells Cersei that the High Septon wishes to speak with her, but Cersei refuses, and when Lancel does not leave at her command, Gregor stands in his way as the Faith attempt to forceably take Cersei.\n\nHe remains unmoved when Lancel orders him to stand down. One of the Sparrows attacks Gregor, and although his weapon's spikes pierce Gregor's plate, Gregor does not say a word or appear to even acknowledge any injury. When the Sparrow tries to attack again, Gregor grabs him by the throat, lifting him into the air and throwing him to the ground. While Lancel and the other Sparrows look on in horror, the towering knight kneels beside him and tears his head off. Lancel and the others thereby stand down. Ser Gregor accompanies Cersei and Qyburn to the Great Hall were Tommen is about to make a royal announcement. As Cersei attempts to stand besides her son, she is barred by Kevan Lannister who tells her place is on the gallery with the other ladies of the court. Cersei reluctantly takes her place there with Gregor following her, causing the women to hastily make place. Tommen announces that Cersei and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven Septons and that trial by combat is forbidden in the Seven Kingdoms, thereby nullifying Cersei's plans on having The Mountain fight as her champion again.On the day of her and Loras Tyrell's trial, Cersei sends Ser Gregor to Tommen's chambers, to prevent him from going to the Great Sept of Baelor to protect him from its destruction. Tommen tries to get past but Gregor easily holds him back. Tommen later commits suicide after hearing of Margaery Tyrell's death in the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. Ser Gregor is summoned by Queen Cersei to the Red Keep dungeons after the explosion, being introduced to Cersei's newest prisoner, Septa Unella. After removing his helmet, revealing his withered and mangled face, Gregor is left alone with Unella, who screams in terror as The Mountain looms over her, ready to carry out his orders to torture the Septa for imprisoning and humiliating Cersei.\n\nLater when Cersei is crowned as Queen, he is seen looming beside the Iron Throne, gazing into the crowd.\n\nSer Gregor is present when Queen Cersei holds court, and moves to protect his queen when Euron Greyjoy steps too close to the throne.\n\nHe is also present when Cersei holds court to the nobility of The Reach.\n\nSer Gregor is also present when Queen Cersei hosts a grand reception with Lord Euron and his prisoners Yara Greyjoy, Ellaria Sand, and Tyene Sand. He is later present in the dungeons with Qyburn when Cersei confronts her prisoners Ellaria and Tyene over the murder of her daughter Myrcella Baratheon. While Cersei had toyed with ordering Ser Gregor to smash their heads like he did with Oberyn Martell, she instead settles for poisoning Tyene with the Long farewell and forcing her to watch her daughter's final death throes.\n\nWhen Daenerys Targaryen and her retainers are set to arrive in King's Landing to negotiate an armistice with Cersei and her royal army, Cersei has Clegane stand in as her personal bodyguard. Even before they set out to the Dragonpit, where the meeting is stated to be held, she makes preparations with Qyburn, Jaime and Clegane. She orders Ser Gregor to first kill Daenerys, then Tyrion, then Jon, and the rest of them in any order if the meeting goes wrong. Together with Clegane, Cersei then sets out to meet their guests. When their procession arrives in the Dragonpit, Sandor Clegane - who is with the group of Daenerys - is shocked to see the state of his hated brother.\n\nOnce Gregor has taken his place behind Cersei, Sandor approaches him. Sandor hatefully states that Gregor is now uglier than Sandor and that this is not how it will end for Gregor. Sandor continues, claiming that Gregor knows that Sandor will be coming for him, before returning to his group. Accordingly, Gregor steps back behind Cersei, only to emerge once more when Daenerys arrives on the dragon Drogon.\n\nWhen Euron Greyjoy takes too many liberties during the parley, threatening the fragile peace, Cersei orders him to sit down or leave. Clegane threatingly makes a step forward to further stress her point. During the parley, Daenerys' group releases a wight to prove the threat the undead pose. Clegane is ready to shield Cersei from the wight but Sandor yanks it back with a chain.\n\nWhen Jon Snow later reveals to Cersei that he already swore allegiance to Daenerys, Cersei calls off the parley and returns to the Red Keep with her retainers, Clegane included. To convince her to accept the armistice, Tyrion follows her and is escorted to her chambers by Clegane, which visibly makes Tyrion uneasy. Clegane escorts Tyrion into the room and remains in the back while Cersei and Tyrion argue and discuss.\n\nHe is ready to execute Tyrion but Cersei never gives the order. Instead, Tyrion actually manages to convince Cersei to come to the Dragonpit again and, accompanied by Clegane and the others, Cersei turns up once more to announce that she will send her armies north to assist in fighting the dead. This, however, is a lie and Cersei has no intention of doing so.\n\nThe group returns to the Red Keep. When Jaime makes it clear to Cersei that he will join the fight against the Army of the Dead with or without her, Clegane suddenly prevents him from leaving the room. Cersei calls Jaime a traitor for disobeying her commands and stating that no one walks away from her. When Cersei nods, Clegane draws his sword, waiting for Cersei to give the order to execute Jaime. However, Jaime calls Cersei out on her bluff and walks right past Clegane, who does not intervene, and out of the room.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gregor_Clegane"}}

He was granted the title of Lord Paramount of the Stormlands by his brother Robert, whose small council he also served on as Master of Laws, but abandoned the latter position when laying claim to the Iron Throne, styling himself as Renly of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. Margaery Tyrell became Renly's queen when she married him in an alliance; however, it was her brother Loras whom he truly loved. During talks of an alliance with the Starks, his reign abruptly ended when a Shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon killed Renly inside his tent. This led most of his bannermen from the Stormlands and some of the Reach to submit to his older brother Stannis as their new king.","Renly has been involved in a homosexual romance with Ser Loras Tyrell for many years. They must keep their love a secret because the dominant religion of the realm, the Faith of the Seven, considers homosexuality to be a sin, although many people are nonetheless aware of their relationship as something of an open secret.","Renly goes hunting with Robert and his retinue. He quarrels with Robert over his glorification of warfare and Robert's needling him about how many girls he has slept with; in Robert's words \"simpler times\" which were in fact more bloody than he is willing to admit. Robert is later fatally gored by a boar off screen.","While Renly intended to eventually march on King's Landing, he was in no great hurry, content to let Robb Stark continue bleeding the Lannisters in the Riverlands. Time was largely on Renly's side, and he could afford to wait longer to assemble as large an army as possible before engaging in the war. Indirectly, however, Renly's faction was adversely affecting the Lannister position simply by closing off the shipment of foodstuffs from the fertile Tyrell-held lands of the Reach to King's Landing. Already overburdened with war refugees, this eventually produced starvation-level conditions among the poor of the capital city, leading to the Riot of King's Landing. Further, the simple existence of Renly's army in the south damaged the Lannister strategic position in the war: Tywin Lannister could not commit all of his forces to marching against Robb Stark at Riverrun or in the Westerlands, without leaving King's Landing undefended from attack by Renly. Instead, Tywin was forced to leave the bulk of his forces at Harrenhal, mid-way between Robb in the north and Renly in the south, to react against whichever of them moved on King's Landing first.","Later, when the two of them are sharing a communal bath (against Brienne's wishes), Jaime, who has since lost his sword hand, reminds her of the vow she made to deliver him to King's Landing in one piece. He agitates her for failing to protect Renly but quickly apologizes upon gauging her reaction. Jaime then regales Brienne with what really happened when he slew the Mad King, and asks her if she would have kept her oath if Renly had commanded her to do the same things as Aerys did, but Brienne is too stunned by Jaime's story to answer.","Several weeks after their arrival in King's Landing, Brienne visits Margaery Tyrell. Brienne explains what she saw and how the shadow had Stannis' face, and assures Margaery that she will find a way to avenge their king. Later, at the wedding feast of Margaery and Joffrey, the latter mistakes Brienne for the one who assassinated Renly Baratheon, which Margaery quickly corrects.","Renly is finally avenged by Brienne following the Battle of Winterfell where Stannis's army is smashed by the forces of Roose Bolton. Brienne finds a wounded Stannis, sentences him to die and personally executes him after he acknowledges his role in Renly's murder.","After Brienne and Sansa Stark reach Winterfell, Brienne later confronts Davos Seaworth and Melisandre, and tells them that she was the one who executed Stannis after his confession about Renly's death, leaving the two of Stannis's former allies stunned.","Scottish actor Sam Heughan auditioned for the role of Renly and was nearly cast. Heughan went on to star as Jamie Fraser in the live-action adaptation of Outlander, opposite Tobias Menzies, who played Edmure Tully.","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Renly is twenty-one when the events of the books begin. He is fifteen years younger than King Robert, whom he strongly resembles in appearance, charisma, and skill at arms. He is the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and the Lord of Storm's End, a source of friction between him and his brother Stannis, who holds the far colder, poorer and more isolated castle of Dragonstone in the King's name. Renly is tremendously friendly, open and honorable, but also has a tendency towards flippancy and not taking events seriously. His closest friend - and lover - at court is his former squire, Ser Loras Tyrell, now a formidable knight in his own right."],"name":"Renly Baratheon","description":"Renly was established to have an extremely strained relationship with his two brothers, Robert and Stannis. The long-ridiculed youngest brother, originally Renly saw no hope of ever becoming king as there were too many heirs with claims better than his for the Iron Throne. With inspiration from his lover Loras Tyrell, however, Renly arrogantly flouted the line of succession and declared himself king ahead of Stannis after Robert died. However, his strained relationship with his brothers didn't prevent him from complimenting Robert behind his back that he used to be good at killing and showing concern when he was mortally wounded by the boar. Renly also claimed to have once loved Stannis after their final encounter, making him the only brother to say as much about one of the others whereas Robert openly stated he never loved either of them. Stannis pretty much says the same about Robert but claims to grieve for Renly in a way after he murders him. However, Stannis does not show genuine remorse for the act until after he is defeated at the Battle of the Blackwater.\n\nUnlike his other brothers, who undoubtedly would make bad kings but were skilled in battle; Robert, a fierce warrior but incompetent king, and Stannis a proven battle commander but unmerciful lord, Renly never raised a sword in combat. Adding to this, he used to become uneasy around violence and blood, throwing up when a knight was maimed after jousting and even after Loras cut him to prove a point, Renly was still squeamish and treated it as if it was a mortal wound. According to him, all he heard about from Robert was how he was never \"tough\" enough, and came to resent the idea that good soldiers automatically make good kings, which was seen when Ned Stark attempted to reinforce Stannis as the rightful heir. He disregarded the fact that a king, while having to be charismatic and peaceful, also had to be legitimately strong, which his brothers were on account of being respectively skilled warriors and commanders.\n\nDespite his lacklustre on the battlefield, Renly was skilled in politics. He became a member of Robert's small council while he was alive and forged a marriage alliance with House Tyrell to support his claim for the Throne, gaining more bannermen and strengthening his army by marrying Margaery Tyrell. At the same time however, the prospect of a marriage alliance was to create a line of children, which he was was unable to do on account of his homosexuality until Margaery reformed that their marriage was only on paper. Renly was patient; for all of his zeal to obtain the title of king he was capable of waiting until Robb Stark had weakened the forces in King's Landing and take control later on. He also had some understanding of warfare tactics and planned to take Joffrey hostage after learning of his true parentage to weaken House Lannister so there would be no opposition for his titles. He was also very receptive to an alliance with the Starks and the Tullys (as he sympathized with them over the execution of Ned Stark) although he made such an alliance conditional to them swearing fealty to him as King; unlike Stannis, however, he wisely did not threaten them with retribution for not submitting, recognizing that it was Joffrey's threats and killing of Ned that had made them rebel in the first place.\n\nFor all of his ambitions, Renly only attempted to assist his own claim and never neutralized those against him. He relied on Joffrey's illegitimacy, made aware by Stannis who also fought for the Iron Throne to support his right and never attempted to demoralize Stannis to his army even though, in the eyes of the Seven Kingdoms, Stannis possessed the most solid claim in comparison to Renly. He relied on his charisma and popularity for the support of his troops rather than propaganda, and disregarded the royal line of succession in favor of the rightful ruler being the best suited, which was automatically him in his opinion. Renly was also a tolerant man, as he allowed Brienne of Tarth to join his Kingsguard, whereas many scorned her for her gender and lack of virtue. In addition, Renly was legitimately kind to Brienne, saving her from scorn when they first met and comforting her, and voicing to Loras that he appreciated her devotion to him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Renly_Baratheon"}}

She was intended to marry King Robb Stark as part of an alliance between her father and him (Walder had given Robb a choice of any one of his many daughters or granddaughters, but Roslin would have been the obvious choice), but Robb fell in love with and married Talisa Maegyr instead.\n\nLothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers arrive at Riverrun after Robb Stark offers to renew their alliance, but Black Walder relays that Lord Walder insists that Edmure Tully must immediately marry Roslin, having \"gone off\" long engagements after Robb reneged on his engagement. Edmure initially refuses, but eventually consents after bowing to family pressure as well as his desire to make amends for his blunder at the Battle of Stone Mill.\n\nEdmure does not meet Roslin until she is unveiled at the wedding. Having seen Walder's other daughters, Edmure was shocked and relieved to see Roslin at last. The newlyweds got along quite well until Robb and Walder called for the bedding ceremony, when Roslin was carried off by Frey and Tully attendants to the bridal chamber. It is not known what, if any, involvement Roslin had in the planning or execution of the grislier parts of her wedding. During their wedding night, Edmure impregnates Roslin, and she later gives birth to a son - although Edmure remains a captive at the Twins.\n\nDuring a conversation between Jaime Lannister and Roslin's captive husband, Edmure, Jaime points out that Roslin has already given Edmure a son that was sired on their wedding night. Edmure then reveals that he hasn't seen Roslin since their wedding night and has never met his son.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Roslin_Tully"}}

After Jon Snow was resurrected by Melisandre, Jon sees to the execution of the men responsible for his own murder at the Mutiny at Castle Black.

Thus Edd is not present at Castle Black during Jon's assassination."],"name":"Eddison Tollett","description":"Edd, also called Dolorous Edd, is a member of the Night's Watch. Edd swore his oath when he was fifteen. His nickname is due to his sarcastic and pessimistic sense of humor.\n\nEdd joins the Great Ranging beyond the Wall led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. As the Night's Watch arrives to Craster's Keep in the Haunted Forest, Edd watches Samwell Tarly and Grenn bickering. Edd approaches Jon Snow, who observes the fortified homestead, and deadpans that he was born in a similar place but that he has now fallen on hard times. Sam, and later Grenn, join the pair and note the women working around the hall. Edd warns not to speak to them. Grenn wonders if Craster, the master of the hall, doesn't like people speaking to his daughters. Edd answers that they are also his wives because Craster marries his daughters and breeds more daughters with them. Sam and Grenn state their disgust and Edd counters that while all the other wildlings in the area have disappeared, Craster is still present, so he must be doing something right.\n\nSam, Edd, and Grenn are peeling potatoes outside Craster's Keep. Edd says that if the gods wanted people to have dignity they would not have made them fart when they died. Grenn is incredulous, and Edd tells him the story of his mother's death. He claims that he held her hand as she passed and that she farted long and hard, then making a farting noise to underscore his assertion. Sam notices Gilly, and observes that it is greedy for Craster to have so many wives. Edd deadpans that they were having a serious discussion. Grenn and Sam and continue their conversation, with Grenn telling Sam of his relationship with a girl named Violet. Edd interrupts again and sends Sam for more vegetables.\n\nHaving left Craster's Keep and the Haunted Forest, the Ranging approaches the Fist of the First Men to meet with Qhorin Halfhand. Edd hears Sam commenting on the beauty of the place and that Gilly would love it there. Edd comments to Grenn that there is nothing more sickening than a man in love.\n\nThe Watch reach the summit of the Fist and set up camp. Edd begs Sam to shut up as he comments on the history of the ancient place. After Sam wonders what the First Men were like, Edd answers they must have been stupid, as smart people wouldn't find themselves in places like the Fist. Jon suggests that their distant ancestors were afraid and came to the Fist to escape something but doesn't believe that it worked.\n\nA horn sounds, causing all men to stop their activities. Jon watches a column of men approaching before saying that a single blast is for rangers returning while two blasts are for wildlings. Edd notes the moment after one blast, standing and waiting, wondering if a second blast will come and repeats that one blast is for friends and two for foes. Sam adds that three blasts are used to signal White Walkers. Jon, Grenn, and Edd turns to look at him and he explains that it has been a thousand years since it was done. Grenn asks how Sam knows if so much time has passed. Edd and Grenn interrupt and, sarcastically, finish Sam's answer before he can say he read it in a book. Grenn walks away while Edd stops when Jon announces it's the Halfhand approaching. Edd says that they will live another day, punctuating his monotone with a sarcastic \"hurrah\".\n\nEdd is close to Jon as Qhorin confirms to Lord Commander Mormont that Mance Rayder has gathered a massive host and reports lookouts in the Skirling Pass. He takes a small party of scouts ahead to surprise the lookouts; Jon is among them.\n\nSome time later, Edd, Grenn, and Sam talk while digging latrines and discuss the possibility that Jon, the Halfhand, and the others rangers might be dead. Grenn discovers a stone tablet marked with runes of the First Men. Edd keeps digging and tells him to leave it alone but he lifts it anyway. Beneath it is a cache of weapons, mostly spearheads, as well a horn, all wrapped in a Night's Watch cloak. Sam identifies them as being made of dragonglass.\n\nNearby the base of the Fist, Edd gathers frozen feces to burn for fire alongside Grenn and Sam. He's annoyed when Sam begins to talk about Gilly and snarks that Sam finds her interesting just because she spoke to him. Sam counters that what he finds interesting about Edd is absolutely nothing. Their banter is interrupted by a horn blast. Sam wonders if the Halfhand has returned and a second horn blast is heard. Grenn draws his sword and Edd tells them to return to the Fist so as not to fight the wildlings alone. A third blast sounds, prompting Edd to scream at his sworn brothers to run. Grenn and Edd quickly make it back to the Fist, seemingly not noticing they have left Sam behind. A massive horde of wights, led by White Walkers, approach the Fist.\n\nEdd survives the White Walkers' attack on the Fist of the First Men, and regroups with the remaining survivors as the ranging attempts to pull back to the Wall. Later, Samwell collapses from exhaustion and is still upset that Grenn and Edd left him alone when the White Walkers came. Edd bluntly tells Samwell that they left him because he is fat and slow, and they did not want to die. Regardless, Grenn and Edd help Samwell back to his feet. Edd arrives with the rest of the survivors at Craster's Keep, where Craster reluctantly allows them to stay. He eats inside with the rest of the survivors.\n\n\u200BEdd and Grenn shovel pig feces for Craster. They both agree that no one ever speaks of all the shoveling, getting attacked, or getting killed, when you join the Night's Watch. Both of them also listen to Rast voice his distrust of Craster and suggest mutiny, but they ignore him. After that, Edd is present during the vigil of a deceased ranger named Bannen, whose body is burned to prevent him from becoming a Wight. Edd pessimistically states that he never knew Bannen could smell so good, since most of the survivors are starving. Later, Edd is present when the Mutiny at Craster's Keep occurs. He is attacked from behind by a mutinous black brother and ultimately subdued and chained up.\n\nWhile the brothers of the Night's Watch at Castle Black discuss the wildling threat, a single horn blast is heard. It is revealed to be Grenn and Edd, who have survived the Mutiny at Craster's Keep. Alliser Thorne questions why it took them so long to return. Edd and Grenn reveal they were held captive by the black brothers who betrayed Commander Mormont. They also state that Karl is the one who is leading them and they are content with staying at the keep, eating Craster's food, and raping his daughter-wives.\n\nWhen Jon Snow's expedition to capture or kill all the mutineers at Craster's Keep is sanctioned by Alliser Thorne, Edd is one of the first to volunteer to go with Jon.\n\nEdd fights alongside his fellow black brothers during the raid on Craster's Keep. After all the deserters are slain, the casualties are taken into account. They initially find that four loyal brothers died fighting the mutineers. However, Edd finds Locke's corpse and brings it back to the Keep, pointing out that they lost five, unaware that Locke was actually a spy for Roose Bolton.\n\nHe returns to the Wall with Jon and Grenn and is greeted by the other brothers of the Night's Watch. He sits in as Jon argues that they should close up the tunnel.\n\nThe news of the wildling attack on Mole's Town has reached Castle Black. Grenn is furious that black brothers were killed, but Edd argues that everyone was ordered to remain at Castle Black. Sam is devastated by the news because he believes that Gilly and her son are most likely dead. Edd reminds Sam that Gilly and her son survived Craster, the long march back to the Wall, and even a White Walker. This gives Sam hope that Gilly may have survived. Jon concludes that if Mole's Town has been attacked, then Mance Rayder's assault on Castle Black is imminent. Edd notes that if the wildlings don't kill them all, there is even worse behind them that will finish the job. He asks whichever of the group is still alive at the end to burn the others, as he doesn't want to come back after he is dead.\n\nEdd is stationed atop the Wall during the Battle of Castle Black. While Janos Slynt panics after given command of the Wall by Alliser Thorne, Edd and Grenn looks at each other in disbelief when Janos rambles that they are 'gangs of thieves' compared to the City Watch of King's Landing. When Jon decides to bring more men down to repel the wildlings in the castle, he leaves Edd in command of the Wall's defenses. With a sizable amount of wildlings still trying to climb the Wall, Edd orders the men to drop the 'scythe'.\n\nA huge section of ice suddenly falls away from the Wall, revealing a massive scythe-like blade attached to a chain that swings along the Wall, cleaving through the wildlings attempting to climb its face. Edd notices the wildling forces are beginning to withdraw into the Haunted Forest, proclaiming to the rest of the defenders that they have stopped them for now, but that the wildlings still outnumber the black brothers 1,000 to 1 and that Mance was simply testing their defenses.\n\nAs Jon Snow leaves Castle Black, Edd is atop the Wall watching as he walks away. After the arrival of Stannis Baratheon and his forces, Edd is present when the fallen brothers are burned in Castle Black's courtyard.\n\nEdd is present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee.\n\nWhen Janos Slynt refuses to man and repair Greyguard, Jon Snow orders him to be brought outside. Edd is initially blocked by Thorne, but he steps aside while giving Edd a look of approval. Edd and two black brothers seize Janos and bring him out to the courtyard. Although Janos boasts of his \"powerful friends\" in the capital, Edd forces Janos down onto the chopping block and watches as he is executed by Jon Snow for refusing to obey orders.\n\nFollowing Jon's decision to allow the wildlings to pass the Wall in order to escape the White Walkers and possibly aid them in the upcoming battle, Edd voices that though he will follow Jon no matter what, he will not forget nor forgive the wildlings for the deaths of Grenn, Pyp, and the others lost in Mance Rayder's attack. Nonetheless, he accompanies Jon Snow and Tormund, along with some other black brothers, when they leave for Hardhome.\n\nEdd accompanies Jon and Tormund as they approach the wildling leaders at Hardhome. After negotiations, Jon asks Edd to start gathering any dragonglass daggers in the tent. Edd does so, and approaches the giant Wun Wun to ask that he give up the dragonglass arrowhead he is curiously observing. However, Wun Wun doesn't give it up and asks Edd \"The fuck you looking at?\" in the giants' rudimentary form of the Old Tongue, so Edd goes away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead. When the White Walkers begin their attack, Edd fights off several wights and, in the confusion, manages to find and retrieve Jon, and they head for the boats. Edd, Jon, Tormund, Wun Wun, and several wildlings narrowly escape the wights chasing after them and barely make it onto a longboat.\n\nEdd is later present alongside Jon and the Night's Watch\/wildling survivors return to Castle Black.\n\nAlerted by Ghost's whimpers, Edd finds Jon's body in Castle Black's courtyard along with Davos Seaworth and several of Jon's friends. They take Jon's body into his quarters for safekeeping. Edd quickly realizes from Jon's stab wounds that Thorne was likely behind the murder. On Davos's advice, Edd frees and brings in Ghost. Davos later starts to create a plan to take on Thorne. Knowing that they are outnumbered and need help from the people in debt to Jon, Edd leaves Castle Black, most likely to track down Tormund and bring him and the wildlings back to aid them. Edd instructs his fellow brothers to lock the door and not let anyone inside until he returns.\n\nEdd manages to locate Tormund and they lead the wildlings back to Castle Black just when the mutineers are on the verge of slaughtering Jon's loyalists. Wun Wun smashes the door down and Edd confronts Thorne, naming him and the mutineers as the true traitors for betraying their Lord Commander. After Thorne and Olly are restrained by wildlings, Edd orders the mutineers locked in the cells for their treachery. Edd leads Tormund to Jon's body, and is later present with Davos, Tormund and Jon's friends when Melisandre attempts to revive Jon the same way Thoros revived Beric Dondarrion six times. When the ritual appears to fail, Edd leaves the room with the rest in disappointment, seconds before Jon awakens.\n\nWhen Davos leads the resurrected Jon into the courtyard, Edd embraces his friend, again quipping that his eyes are not blue. Edd is later present at the hanging of the traitors led by Alliser Thorne. After the execution, Edd suggests that they burn the bodies. Jon hands his Night's Watch cloak over to Edd as Jon verbally gives him control of the Wall. Thereafter, Edd becomes the acting Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.\n\nWhile Jon packs his things, Edd chastises him for abandoning the Watch, since those who betrayed and murdered him have been dealt with, but Jon, still traumatized, refuses to listen. Edd reminds Jon that the Watch's vows are meant for life, to which Jon counters that he has already given his life. A horn sounds and Edd and Jon run outside to see Jon's sister, Sansa Stark, arrive with Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne. He witnesses Jon and Sansa embrace.\n\nLater, Edd eats with Jon, Sansa, Brienne, Podrick and Tormund, apologizing to Sansa for the food's poor quality in comparison to that of Winterfell, and appearing slightly amused at Tormund's admiration for Brienne. Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton, and Edd listens as Jon and Sansa read it aloud, where Ramsay demands Sansa's return on threat of harming Jon and his friends. Edd shows visible signs of anger at Ramsay's threats.\n\nEdd later attends a war council with Jon, Sansa, Davos, Brienne, Podrick and Tormund, remaining silent while listening to Jon, Sansa and Davos's plans for their upcoming battle with Ramsay. As they prepare to leave, Edd hugs Jon one last time, wishing him good luck. Jon jokingly asks Edd not to knock the Wall down while he's gone. Once they have left, a brother asks Edd's permission to close the gate by calling him Lord Commander. It takes Edd a few moments to remember that Jon named him acting Lord Commander, and he gives the order to \"close the bloody gate\".\n\nThinking they are wildlings, Edd confronts Meera Reed and Bran Stark on the northern side of the Wall. Even after revealing their identities, Edd is still suspicious, until Bran reveals his knowledge of Edd's time at the Fist of the First Men and Hardhome. Allowing them to enter Castle Black, Edd looks ominously at the lands which will soon be filled with wights.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Eddison_Tollett"}}

It is home to the Citadel, where men and boys from throughout the kingdoms come to receive their training as maesters.\n\nMaesters play an integral role in Westerosi society, serving as scholars, healers, and advisers to the nobility of the Seven Kingdoms. This venerable order of learned men dedicate their lives to serving the realm, and are sworn to occupy a neutral position when it comes to power and politics.\n\nUpon completing his training at the Citadel and taking his vows, a maester renounces his family name and takes a vow of celibacy. He is assigned to a castle or keep, and duty-bound to serve as its counselor and healer, even if control of the castle changes hands. A maester\u2019s allegiance is to the realm, not to any one family.\n\nHis badge of office is a great chain, forged from links of different metals, which he wears around his neck. It is a reminder of his role as a servant of the realm and is never to be removed. A maester forges his chain with study, and each link represents the mastery of a different kind of learning. For instance, a silver link signifies mastery of the medicinal arts. A golden link represents the study of money and accounting. An iron link indicates knowledge of warcraft. Ravenry is an especially important skill for a maester, as it is he who breeds, trains, and maintains carrier ravens for the delivering of messages throughout the land.\n\nThere are some maesters who have earned a link forged of Valyrian steel. This signifies knowledge of the \"higher mysteries\", commonly known as \"magic\". Only one maester in a hundred possesses such a link, as this field of study is frowned upon by many in the order. It is possible magic may have existed for a time, long ago, but most consider the higher mysteries to be long gone from this world.\n\nService as a maester is a noble calling, one of vital importance to a prosperous realm. It is little wonder there are some who refer to the order as the \"Knights of the Mind\".\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Order_of_the_Maesters_(Complete_Guide_to_Westeros)"}}

Reluctantly, Jorah tells the truth, at Daenerys's request. He confesses to providing the spider the information on Daenerys's activities in Essos.","Even though the fear is clearly shown on her face, Daenerys refuses. Jorah manages to win the fight despite being outmatched during most of it. Just as the fight ends, Jorah throws a spear towards Daenerys, who, believing the spear was meant for her, ducks out of the way. The spear is revealed to be meant for a Son of the Harpy who was sneaking up behind her. Much of the audience reveals themselves to be Sons of the Harpy, proceeding to kill everyone they can. Jorah joins the ensuing battle for Daenerys and tries to help escort her out of the fighting pit, but they eventually end up surrounded and vastly outnumbered.

Lynesse was used to the riches and luxury of the second-largest city in Westeros and found Bear Island primitive and crude. Jorah's attempts to please his wife led to him spending all of his money. He disgraced himself through behavior unbefitting a lord by arresting poachers and selling them to slavers. Slavery is illegal in the Seven Kingdoms and has been for millennia.

Jorah has a deep respect, loyalty and love for Daenerys, and has always tried to give her reasonable, practical, and effective advice. While Jorah is a moral person and always tries to be honorable, he has done several dishonorable acts out of love or for his own survival. He sold poachers into slavery to pay for his wife's spending habits, fled Westeros to escape execution, and briefly spied on Daenerys in the hope of receiving a royal pardon, though he stopped spying on her after becoming her advisor. Jorah is Daenerys's most level-headed advisor, at least until the arrival of Barristan Selmy.\n\nJorah is intelligent, literate and well travelled, knowing the histories of Essos and speaking several tongues, including Dothraki.\n\nHis relationship with his father, and likely the rest of his family, wasn't approached until the fifth season. Although he never showed any feelings towards Jeor, once he was given the news about his death, Jorah was visibly shaken and deeply upset, even angrily demanding to know the details of his father's death. This is most likely because he was still feeling guilty about bringing his family shame and never fully reconciling with Jeor.\n\nAlthough stoic, short-spoken and sometimes cold, Jorah does have the ability to warm up to people once they earn his respect. At first, he treated Tyrion like a hostage, but later, after the two barely survived the sinking of their boat, he started to trust Tyrion enough to leave him untied and later the two men shared their life stories and freely discussed Daenerys and her claim to the throne, although their newfound trust was shattered when Tyrion convinced Daenerys to exile Jorah from Meereen again (which he did to spare him Daenerys's wrath).\n\nHe is also a skilled warrior, though he does have a honor code, and tries not to kill his opponent if such option is possible. This is shown in the fighting pit, where every other warrior was brutally slaughtering one another, but Jorah came victorious without any loss of life in his hands. This worked in his favor since he was aware that Daenerys was becoming increasingly appalled by the needless violence happening in the pit right before Jorah got into the skirmish. And even after using brute force to harm another person, he does seem to try compensate for his actions, as he did give some money to a knocked out fisherman for his stolen boat. Also, Jorah has an immense tolerance for pain as he managed to stay silent during Sam's procedure to cure him of the greyscale even though the Citadel apprentice was effectively cutting bits of Jorah's own skin.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jorah_Mormont"}}

To Mira\u2019s great surprise, she enjoyed attending on Margaery at Highgarden, and followed her to King\u2019s Landing with enthusiasm. Life in the capital has not been easy for Mira, as her straightforward Northern ways are often at odds with the subtleties of court life \u2013 but she also has more guile than she realizes.\n\nMira is at King's Landing as handmaiden to Margaery, as she was sent south by her mother, who wanted her to learn the ways of the south. Mira receives a letter from her mother asking her to appeal to Lady Margaery to try and ask her to intervene on the house's behalf. Later she talks with Margaery, and Margaery tells her Queen Cersei demands an apology from Mira, and wishes to have an audience with her.\n\nFellow handmaiden Sera Durwell goes to the throne room while Margaery and Mira wait outside, talking about the upcoming talk. Sera comes and gets them and they are allowed in. In the court she must prove to Queen Cersei that the allegiance of House Forrester lies with the Crown. Cersei also questions whether she is loyal to King Joffrey or Margaery. Cersei also asks if House Forrester is willing to supply ironwood to the Crown. She also has a little conversation with Tyrion Lannister. She is also offered help by a coal boy. Mira receives news that Ramsay Snow is riding for Ironrath and fears for the safety of her family. She may ask Margaery to request Joffrey to give House Forrester the protection of the crown so no harm can come to her family. However Joffrey refuses to do so and the safety of her House is in jeopardy. \n\nIn Mira's first appearance in the episode, she is writing invitations for Lady Margaery's wedding to King Joffrey. A letter is delivered to her from her mother by Tom the coal boy, asking for help in ensuring Lady Elaena Glenmore's betrothal to Rodrik remain intact. Her mother wishes for Lady Margaery to help by sending a letter to the Glenmores encouraging the marriage. However, Margaery refuses, stating she doesn't want to force Elaena's hand, and says she is sure her brother can secure the marriage on his own. Mira is given the choice whether to finish an invitation to Ser Maynard or forge a letter to Elaena Glenmore. Handmaiden Sera enters the room, and asks to talk to Mira.\n\nMira and Sera walk in the gardens around King's Landing, and Sera leads Mira to a seating area, where she reveals she has a cask of wine from Cersei's favorite stock. Mira has the choice whether to drink some of the wine or not. Sera reveals she is in fact a bastard, and her full name is Sera Flowers. During their talk they get interrupted by Tyrion Lannister, who questions them about the source of the wine. He reveals his father has become interested in ironwood, and that he is meeting representatives, two merchant lords, Andros and Morgryn of Lord Whitehill, and invites Mira along. After the shock of learning Tyrion invited Mira, Tyrion dismisses the representatives and discusses the ironwood business with Mira. Mira returns to her room later to find someone has been in and looked through her stuff, and left a note, asking to meet in the gardens at midnight.\n\nMira goes to the gardens at midnight to see who left the note. She gets stopped by a Lannister guardsman, the same one that stood at the door for the discussion of the ironwood earlier in the episode, but then Ser Damien steps in for Mira. He talks to her, but then he tries to assassinate her. She manages to struggle for a while, but Tom knocks him off her. However, Damien begins to drown him in the fountain, and Mira has the choice to attack and kill Damien, or run away. Tom offers to get rid of the body for Mira if she killed him, and she also has a choice to keep or toss the knife.\n\nMargaery's wedding to Joffrey is only days away, and in arriving to help prepare, Mira listens distractedly as Sera voices her excitement at the prospect of potentially finding a husband. As Sera asks Mira to cover for her as she leaves to introduce herself to Lord Tarwick, Mira notices the coal boy hiding in the bushes. If Mira hadn't helped the coal boy from the drowning, Mira will be surprised to see him alive. The coal boy will be angry with her for not helping him. If Mira had killed Damien in order to save the coal boy, their conversation will go more smoothly. Regardless, the coal boy (whose name will be mentioned as Tom, dependent on dialogue choices) will update Mira on news regarding the murder, that the body has been hid, but Damien's blood has been discovered at the scene, although they couldn't know for sure it is Damien's. Fearful, Mira will remind him of the guard that had seen her that night or of the knife. Tom will promise Mira that he'll watch her back. Sera will then announce her presence, catching them together. Sera will assume they have a romantic relationship, and the player can choose to play along to ward off suspicion.\n\nMira and Sera will meet Margaery in the Throne room only to find out that Cersei has demanded that they not attend. It is then that Cersei will reveal to Margaery that Tyrion and Mira have been having private conversations. Margaery, now suspicious, will ask Mira about this. Mira can argue on the defense of helping her family, or can blatantly deny working with Tyrion, but Margaery will disapprove either way. Margaery then threatens to send Mira back to Westeros if Margaery hears of or sees Mira speaking even a word to Tyrion again. However, this proves to be difficult as Tyrion will later approach the handmaiden to update her on the Ironwood Decree. Mira can either defy Margaery and follow Tyrion, or act loyal and stay behind with her. If Mira accepts Tyrion's offer to talk, Mira will be pleasantly surprised to hear that Tyrion has accepted her plea of having the Crown buy exclusively from the Forrester's. However, this defiance puts her in hot-water with Margaery when she returns, and Margaery demands that Sera be the one who will help her prepare for the wedding. If Mira denies Tyrion, he will instead tell her about the decree in front of Margaery and Sera. The outcome will still result in Margaery being disappointed in Mira for talking to him, and requesting that Sera replace her in her duties.\n\nAt the wedding, Sera will tell Mira that Margaery is thinking of who could replace Mira, implying the damage that has been done to their relationship. Mira will be confronted by a guard who noticed her in the gardens with Damien on the night of his murder. Lord Morgryn will purposely bump into the guard, spilling wine all over his shirt and demanding that Mira help clean it up. Mira can express gratitude over this escape, and Morgryn will express respect for the handmaiden that managed to steal an ironwood contract right out from under his nose. Morgryn will propose an alliance between the two before the wedding erupts into chaos. Mira watches in confusion and fear as Tyrion is arrested for the poisoning of King Joffrey. Morgryn then says that an alliance is now impossible as now is a bad time to be linked to Tyrion. As he departs, Morgryn implies that getting rid of the decree may be the only one in keeping herself safe and setting up an alliance between them again.\n\nWith the help of Tom, Mira breaks into Tyrion's office and steals the decree from his strongbox. At the end of the episode, Mira has the choice of burning the decree or keeping it. As well, depending on how the player has treated Tom until this point, Tom may abandon Mira out of frustration for her horrible treatment of him.\n\nMira has only two scenes, but still plays a key role in this episode.\n\nMira, who is officially on the outs with Margaery and is looking to be replaced, is tasked with sneaking into Tommen's Coronation Feast. Mira learns that Ludd Whitehill has been sending a great amount of gold to someone in King's Landing for unknown reasons, and her two main suspects are his merchants, Morgryn and Andros. Depending on the players relationship with Sera thus far, Mira can influence Sera's decision into helping her in multiple ways. If they have a good friendship, Sera will initially still be skeptical but will ultimately want to help her friend. If their relationship has been soured, Mira will either have to plead, blackmail her, or force her. As Mira is let in by the guard, Mira is formally introduced to Sera's potential husband, Lord Garibald Tarwick. Spotting Morgryn and Andros arguing nearby, Mira dismisses herself and eavesdrop on the two of them. Mira learns that Andros is now the exclusive business contact for the Whitehills and that Morgryn has been pushed out of the business.\n\nMorgryn is both pleased and surprised to see Mira again, but will also confirm that the alliance is impossible now that he is out of the ironwood business. Mira will learn from Morgryn that Andros has a new business partner: Lyman Lannister. Mira talks to Lyman and nearly gets him to spill his business secrets when Andros catches them talking and chastises the both of them. Andros yells at Mira to stay out of his business. However, when Mira learns from Tarwick that Andros has been telling people that Lyman's addicted to drinking the milk of the poppy, Mira may use this information to manipulate Lyman into revealing what the Whitehills have been planning. Shockingly, Mira will learn that Andros has been building a secret army for the Whitehills so that they can march across Ironrath, effectively destroying the Forresters in the process.\n\nWhen Lyman confronts Andros about his betrayal, Andros and Mira will get into another argument. However, Mira will remain calm and confident during this altercation, often giving an air of superiority. Andros turns red and storms off, while Mira makes a graceful exit.\n\nMira looks out to sea before being approached by Sera. Sera states she hadn't seen Mira since the coronation feast. Mira questions Sera if she knew how many ships would be needed to move an army. The two start walking. Sera reminisces on how the risk she took letting Mira into the coronation feast, and how the scene Mira made with Andros did not go unnoticed by Margaery, who is angry at it happening. Sera breaks to Mira that she can no longer be associated with her. They walk to a corner where Margaery is talking with several women. Before Sera can finish her statement that she must leave, two Lannister guards pull her aside and take her away, but not before she gets noticed by Margaery.\n\nThe guards take her to Tyrion's chambers, where Queen Cersei waits. The queen notes that Mira has been in his chambers before, questions if she's an honest person, and asks how she entered Tommen's coronation feast. In exchange for Mira learning the people who will testify for Tyrion Lannister at his trial, Cersei will deal with Andros.\n\nRegardless of Mira's choices, she will be sent to the accused dwarf's cell. During her visit, the player can either try to hide her true intention, or tell Tyrion that Cersei sent her, confirming his suspicion. In both cases Mira failed to learn any actual information and was dragged away by Lucan.\n\nMira is summoned by Lady Margaery, who asks if Mira knows anything about Sera stealing wine from Queen Cersei. Margaery later condemns her handmaidens for making a scene in King Tommen's coronation feast. If Mira admits that she was using Sera to gain access, Margaery will dismiss Mira from her service. Sera warns Mira that someone is spreading vile rumors and plotting against her. The two friends then bid farewell.\n\nAs Mira is returning to her room, she is stopped by Tom, who noticed Lannister guards breaking into her room. Tom confirms the scandalous rumors, which say that Mira takes Lannister soldiers to her bed and murders them in their sleep. He also mentions that someone left a note to the captain of Lannister guards, Lucan. Before he is arrested by Lannister guards, Tom directs Mira to head to a collier's store by the River Gate and leave the city.\n\nIn an alleyway of King's Landing, Mira is intercepted by Lannister guards, so she seeks refuge from the nearby Lord Morgryn. The merchant lord bribes the guards to leave and offers to take Mira to the River Gate by his litter. During the short journey, Morgryn compliments Mira's boldness and cleverness to eliminate his business rival, Andros, who has now been imprisoned in the Black Cells. However, he then reveals that he was plotting against Mira all along, and had hired Ser Damien to kill her. When Mira tries to reason with him, he gets furious and attacks her. He then tosses her out of his litter to the waiting Lucan.\n\nMira is locked up in a cell, awaiting immediate execution. Lord Morgryn comes to her cell later and offered a way out for her: becoming Morgryn's wife. Morgryn plans to use Mira's Forrester name to claim Ironrath, as Ludd will soon kill the rest of her family. He will then make a move against the Whitehills as well. In this way he could dominate the entire Ironwood trade and improve his social status from merchant lord to a true nobility.

She realizes Jaime must have known this, but embellished her father's wealth in order to convince Locke to leave her unharmed.\n\nLord Selwyn responds to Locke's ransom demand via raven, offering a ransom of three hundred Gold Dragons in exchange for Brienne's release. Unfortunately, Locke became so convinced by Jaime's previous spur of the moment lie to save Brienne that he refuses Selwyn's offer, and will settle for nothing less than literally Brienne's weight in sapphire gemstones.

He was stripped of his chain by the Archmaesters for engaging in forbidden human experimentation: it was discovered that he had been vivisecting men in his pursuit of medical knowledge. Qyburn held to the belief that the death of a few men was justifiable if it would lead to medical breakthroughs that would save the lives of many more.","Qyburn volunteers to join the party escorting Jaime back to King's Landing. Lord Bolton theorizes that the former Maester is doing so in the hopes that Tywin Lannister will force the Citadel to restore his chain, though Jaime shoots it down by sarcastically quipping that Tywin will make Qyburn Grand Maester if he grows Jaime a new hand. After leaving Harrenhal, when Qyburn checks on Jaime's healing stump, Jaime notes that Qyburn's work is far superior to that of Grand Maester Pycelle and asks why the Citadel removed his chain.

Cersei then gives Qyburn permission to do anything he can to save Clegane and to come to her should he need anything. Qyburn warns the Queen that the process he intends to put Ser Gregor through may \"change him\", but when she is satisfied that it will not affect his strength, she instructs Qyburn to carry on.","Qyburn is at the meeting of the Small Council when Mace Tyrell departs to negotiate the crown's debt with the Iron Bank of Braavos.","In his laboratory, Qyburn continues to serve as Master of Whispers by bribing a group of Varys's little birds into his service with boxes of sweets.

Qyburn has his spies create leaks in the barrels containing the wildfire, then has them place candles in the middle of the resulting puddles, which slowly burn towards the wildfire. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Sept of Baelor, killing the High Sparrow, Mace Tyrell, Queen Margaery, Loras Tyrell, Kevan Lannister, and many others. Qyburn also has Pycelle assassinated by his spies so as to consolidate Cersei's power. For his service and loyalty, Qyburn is made Cersei's Hand of the Queen, and later crowns her as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.","When Tycho Nestoris meets again with Cersei Lannister, the Queen assures the representative of the Iron Bank of Braavos that the bank will soon have its gold. Tycho suggests that the Iron Bank may invest in Cersei in her venture to establish her control over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and Cersei informs Tycho that her her Hand has already reached out to the Golden Company, a powerful sellsword company in Essos.","However, Cersei forgets an important fact: she is not the only one who can extract confessions by torturing. One of her henchmen, Osney Kettleblack, is tortured at the High Sparrow's command, and the truth comes out including about the murder of the previous High Septon. After Cersei herself is imprisoned and the High Sparrow learns of her plot against Margaery, the suspects continue to admit their guilt, but the High Sparrow is not impressed, as he can see they are clearly half mad. However, the High Sparrow still means to try Margaery, though the case against her is weak, primarily because of the unreliability of the suspects."],"name":"Qyburn","description":"Externally, Qyburn appears to be an extremely harmless, polite and serene old man - he behaves calmly and patiently around everyone he meets, even if they do not have a good impression of him. Jaime viewed him as an \"odd little man\" and didn't entirely trust him, even when Qyburn operated on the wound left by his severed hand. Qyburn has proven himself to be, in his own right, highly intelligent to a fault, so much that he was the only one who knew a way to save Ser Gregor Clegane after he was savagely wounded by Oberyn Martell during their fateful duel in the trial by combat. When Qyburn expressed that he knew a way of saving Gregor, he did so without bragging, instead that it was a matter of fact, which Pycelle interpreted as arrogance and pride. Qyburn is, at the same time, extremely secretive, not truly revealing the methods he used to save the Mountain, instead expressing that the process would change Gregor, but not weaken him, and make him supremely obedient to Cersei. Qyburn doesn't seem to express any outward disdain towards Ser Gregor for almost killing him at Harrenhall, but then again Qyburn rarely expresses disdain for much of anything. It is therefore unknown whether Qyburn suggested he experiment on Ser Gregor out of revenge or if he simply did so in the interest of his constant pursuit of knowledge.\n\nIn spite of Qyburn's soft and calm exterior, he is potentially a very dangerous man because of his secretive, ruthless and unethical methods. The Citadel once expelled Qyburn on the basis that the experiments that he enacted were unnatural and unacceptable, which Qyburn deemed foolish. Pycelle scorns Qyburn for this, naming him an embarrassment to the Citadel. Qyburn maintained his loyalty to Cersei and carried out any task she set for him, but it is unspecified if he had personal reasons or if he was simply loyal to Cersei. Qyburn was quick to end the interference of Pycelle in Cersei's plots by having him assassinated by his little birds. In spite of this, Qyburn expressed that he himself didn't have any personal grievances towards Pycelle and even told the old man that the necessity of murdering him pained Qyburn - this shows that Qyburn does not have sadistic or murderous intentions, but simply saw the act of killing the old Grand Maester as utterly necessary to consolidate Cersei's power. However, none of these factors prevented Qyburn from having a look of cold satisfaction on his face as he watched his little birds overwhelm Pycelle.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Qyburn"}}

Along with her father's paramour, Ellaria Sand, and her half-sisters Obara Sand and Tyene Sand, she takes part in the Coup in Dorne, during which they seize power in Dorne from the legitimate House Martell. She is ultimately killed by Euron Greyjoy in his ambush of the Iron Fleet.","After Henwick was cast to co-star in Netflix's Iron Fist Marvel TV series, she ran into a scheduling conflict for filming on Game of Thrones Season 7. She very nearly didn't return, and as she put it, the producers said that if she couldn't make her schedule work they wouldn't bother to recast the role, but instead Nymeria would simply disappear - never appearing again, without explanation. At the last minute, however, she was able to squeeze it into her schedule by making repeated international plane flights to juggle working on both shows.","In the beginning of A Feast for Crows, Nymeria is the second of the Sand Snakes who confronts Prince Doran about his failure to avenge their father. She joins his retinue on the way to Sunspear. She is aware of Obara's plan to declare a war against the Lannisters, but has a different plan: she and Tyene will assassinate Tywin, Cersei, Jaime and Tommen. She says that if Doran had been the one to be killed, Oberyn would have led the Dornish troops north before his corpse was cold. She warns Doran that she and her sisters will not wait seventeen years for their vengeance, and leaves. After Doran arrives at Sunspear, he takes steps to make certain Nymeria and the other Sand Snakes will not ignite a war."],"name":"Nymeria Sand","description":"Nymeria Sand is the second of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the \"Sand Snakes\". Nymeria's mother was an Eastern noblewoman, who taught her how to use a whip in combat, but who later died in battle. Nymeria became very skilled with using her 8 foot long bullwhip in combat.\n\nNymeria inherited her father's cunning, and is the most observant and calculating of the Sand Snakes. Instead of charging head-on into a situation relying on brute strength (like her older sister Obara), she will stand back and observe her enemy's weak points, then move in precisely for an accurate strike. In this, she is actually more like her uncle, Doran Martell, than like her father. Her choice of a bullwhip as her primary weapon exemplifies this mentality. She hones her reflexes by playing a sparring game with her younger sister Tyene, in which one slaps the other's hands before they can move them; Nymeria claims she has never lost this game.\n\nNymeria dresses more femininely than her martial sister Obara, though she is no less deadly. Nymeria has long flowing hair, and alluring Dornish-style dresses.\n\nShe is named after Nymeria, the warrior-queen of the Rhoynar who led her people's migration to Dorne one thousand years ago. The original Nymeria unified Dorne for the first time, and is considered the founder of House Martell in its modern form. \"Nymeria\" is a popular name in Dorne, much as \"Brandon\" is in the North, after their founder Brandon the Builder. Through her father Oberyn, Nymeria Sand is actually a direct descendant of the original Nymeria.\n\nOberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister.\n\nWhen Ellaria Sand goes to the Water Gardens to scold Doran for his inaction to Oberyn's murder, she tells the Prince that Dorne must go to war against the Lannisters, and points out that the Sand Snakes, who have the love of their people, agree with her, and that they will avenge their father if Doran does not.\n\nNymeria, Tyene, and Obara meet with Ellaria to discuss rallying Dorne to go to war against House Lannister. When the conversation shifts to Myrcella Baratheon, Obara reveals information she received from a merchant captain that Jaime Lannister has been smuggled into Dorne. Ellaria insists that they must stop Jaime from reaching Myrcella. They are presented with a choice: side with Doran and have peace, or side with Ellaria and have war. Nymeria, Tyene, and Obara agree to side with Ellaria.\n\nDuring the attempted kidnapping of Myrcella, Nymeria initially attacks Jaime with her whip but quickly switches to Bronn, aided by Tyene, while Obara drives Jaime away from the others. Obara barks at Nym to \"take her\" and Nym breaks off from the fight and grabs Myrcella by the arm. Myrcella resists, but Nym silences her by brandishing a knife in her face. However, as she tries to drag her away they are cut off and surrounded by Areo Hotah and the rest of Prince Doran's personal guard. Areo forces Nym and her sisters to drop their weapons, and they, along with Jaime, Bronn and Ellaria, are arrested.\n\nThe Sand Snakes share a prison cell next to Bronn, which proves irritating to Nym and Obara as Bronn continues singing \"The Dornishman's Wife\". When Tyene begins flirting with Bronn, Nym looks bored until he begins succumbing to his poisoned wound; she and Obara watch with amusement as Tyene toys with Bronn's life before finally giving him the antidote.\n\nNym spends her time in the cell playing a game of reflexes with Tyene, while Obara ignores them and tries to sleep. Nym mocks Tyene as she repeatedly slaps her hands, claiming she has never lost the game and that her little sister must enjoy either humiliation or pain. Tyene claims she overthinks things, causing Nym to hesitate; when she swings again, Tyene moves her hands away in time. Nym mocks her again as she offers her own hands, but Tyene instead slaps her across the face, angering her. Their argument is interrupted by the arrival of Areo Hotah.\n\nLater, Nym, Obara and Tyene- bound at the wrists- witness Ellaria swear allegiance to Doran Martell, ending her rebellion.\n\nNym is present with her sisters and Ellaria on the docks to see Jaime, Myrcella, and Trystane off; however, Ellaria had poisoned Myrcella with a kiss before she left on the boat. As the poison begins to work on Ellaria as well she drinks the antidotes, and the three sisters leave the docks with Ellaria, satisfied that they were able to avenge Oberyn, if only slightly.\n\nEllaria stages a coup in Dorne that claims the life of Doran and Hotah, and sends Nym with Obara to ambush Trystane. Though Trystane chooses to fight Nym, Obara impales him in the head from behind, to Nym's chagrin, who calls Obara a \"greedy bitch\", as she had been looking forward to murdering her own cousin.\n\nMany months later, Nym is present when Ellaria meets with Olenna Tyrell in the Water Gardens. The Queen of Thorns shuts down Nym and her sisters when they attempt to speak, demanding that the \"grown women\" converse without their interruption. Ellaria claims that Dorne and The Reach must work together for justice and vengeance, as Queen Cersei has declared war on both of their factions. Varys appears, claiming that they will defeat Cersei with \"Fire and Blood\", making it clear that Ellaria, the Sand Snakes, and House Tyrell will support Daenerys Targaryen's claim to the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nAfter Daenerys and her fleet arrive at Dragonstone, The Dragon Queen and her hand, Tyrion Lannister, decide to send the Martell and Greyjoy fleets to Sunspear in order to stage a joint attack on King's Landing together along with House Tyrell. Nymeria accompanies Ellaria, Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and her sisters on the journey. Below the deck of their ship, Nymeria and Obara playfully tease Tyene. After they are ambushed by Euron Greyjoy and his fleet, both Nymeria and Obara confront Euron while Tyene protects Ellaria. After the Lord Reaper of the Iron Islands kills Obara, an enraged Nymeria attacks him with her whip, only to be choked to death and then hung from the prow of the ship with her weapon, next to her sister.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Nymeria_Sand"}}

When help did arrive it was not an army, however, but Rhaenys riding her large red dragon Meleys, which proceeded to burn many of the soldiers besieging Rook's Rest.\n\nIt was all a trap, however, as two enemy dragons suddenly confronted Meleys: Aegon II riding Sunfyre, and Vhagar - the largest and greatest living dragon - ridden by Aegon II's younger brother Aemond Targaryen.\n\nMeleys had no hope of winning against both of them, but to her credit Rhaenys did not flee, instead turning Meleys to meet them head-on. In the massive mid-air battle that followed dragon fought dragon, and their flames burned so brightly it was as if a second sun blossomed in the sky.\n\nWhen the smoke of their confrontation finally cleared, only Vhagar and Aemond were not seriously wounded. Meleys was dead, torn to shreds, and her rider Rhaenys burned to ash. Yet Meleys did not die without exacting a price: she had maimed Sunfyre, almost completely tearing one of his wings from his body. Aegon II himself was gravely wounded, crushed under his dragon and severely burned over half his body. He survived, but had to be sedated with Milk of the poppy, and remained hovering out of consciousness for months. This left Aemond to command Aegon II's faction while his brother convalesced - another serious blow, as it turned out, for Aemond was hot-head and poor strategist, easily fooled into leaving King's Landing poorly defended.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Meleys"}}

One night Ser Lorimer got drunk and stole a ham, which he shared with Podrick. Lorimer was caught and the two were sentenced to be hanged. Podrick was spared because of his family name.\n\nAs punishment, Tywin Lannister sent him to King's Landing to serve as squire to his son Tyrion.\n\nTyrion has Janos Slynt as a dinner guest in the dining room of the Tower of the Hand. Podrick pours wine for them, but spills the beverage on Janos's hand. Janos begins to chastise the boy, but Tyrion dismisses him and says they know how to pour their own wine.\n\nPodrick attends Tyrion during a dinner he holds with Queen Cersei. He cannot repress a smile when Tyrion jokes about Joffrey's inability to rule.\n\nPodrick squires for Tyrion during the Battle of the Blackwater. He dresses Tyrion in his armor prior to the battle during a meeting with Lord Varys. Varys asks Tyrion if he trusts Podrick and Tyrion says that he does. Varys then shows them a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. When King Stannis Baratheon lands near the Mud Gate Tyrion dispatches Podrick to fetch reinforcements from the King's Gate. Podrick does as ordered, returning with a host of men just as King Joffrey flees back to the Red Keep. Tyrion urges his surviving men and Podrick's reinforcements to help him fight the invaders. He orders Ser Mandon Moore and Ser Boros Blount to join him in leading a sortie through the tunnels. Podrick accompanies Tyrion outside the walls. In the midst of battle, Ser Mandon attempts to murder Tyrion.\n\nHe strikes after Tyrion has removed his helmet but only succeeds in cutting his face. Podrick kills Ser Mandon by shoving a spear through the back of his head, saving Tyrion's life. He cradles Tyrion in his arms as he collapses into unconsciousness.\n\nWhen Tyrion wakes up, Podrick is in the room as Varys tells Tyrion about what has been happening while he is unconscious. Tyrion thanks Podrick for saving his life. When Tyrion tells Podrick to go summon Bronn to post Gold Cloaks at his door and to find the hill tribes, Varys stops him and tells Tyrion that Bronn is no longer leading the Gold Cloaks and the hill tribes have gone home. Podrick opens the door to let in Shae, then he leaves the room with Varys.\n\nTyrion sends Podrick to urgently get Bronn. Podrick finds Bronn at Littlefinger's brothel with Mirelle and insists he come with him to Bronn's frustration. When they arrive back at the Red Keep, Bronn has Podrick back him up that Bronn has just recently been knighted when two Kingsguards insult him.\n\nBronn reminds Tyrion that he still owes Podrick for having saved Tyrion's life. Tyrion then brings Podrick to Littlefinger's brothel and pays for three prostitutes (Marei, Genna, and the contortionist Kayla) to take Podrick's virginity. Podrick later returns with all of Tyrion's coins as the prostitutes enjoyed the experience so much that they did not want any payment. Tyrion and Bronn are amazed and insist that Podrick tell them everything that happened, in \"copious detail\".\n\nRos later mentions to a confused Varys that the girls all said Podrick was the best they'd ever had, and that as three professional prostitutes, they'd been with a lot of men. Varys asks if it's that he's very large, but Ros says that according to the girls he wasn't particularly large, so much as what he did. Varys asks what it was, but Ros says that while the three prostitutes are often very descriptive, the most they could say about the wonderful experience was that it was \"hard to describe\".\n\nSometime later, Pod is present when Lady Olenna Tyrell meets with Tyrion to discuss the costs of the upcoming royal wedding. Olenna admonishes Pod for giving her too much wine and sends him off for figs. Upon returning with the fruit, she sarcastically asks if he retrieved them from Volantis before departing.\n\nPodrick shares wine with Tyrion, but has trouble keeping up with him. Tyrion, already drunk and unhappy about his forced marriage, tells him if being drunk all the time was easy then everybody would do it. Soon after, Cersei arrives and orders Podrick to leave so she may speak to her brother alone.\n\nBearing the king's banner, Podrick awaits the arrival of Prince Doran Martell of Dorne along with Tyrion and Bronn. As the Dornishmen approach, he correctly identifies the heraldry of several Dornish houses, to the approval of Tyrion. Bronn replies that he needs a sigil. When they learn from the envoys that Doran's brother Oberyn Martell has come to the city instead, and that he arrived before dawn, Podrick accompanies Tyrion and Bronn to Littlefinger's brothel to greet Prince Oberyn and his paramour, Ellaria Sand.\n\nIn the aftermath of Joffrey's assassination, an unnamed Gold Cloak approaches Pod, offering him knighthood if he agrees to testify against Tyrion, who is suspected of committing the crime. Pod adamantly refuses. Later, Pod speaks to Tyrion in his cell, who reveals that Bronn is currently being investigated for information on the poison used to kill Joffrey, and that by refusing the Gold Cloak's offer, Pod has implicated himself as a suspect as well. Tyrion insists that Pod flee King's Landing before he too is arrested, and Pod tearfully agrees only after Tyrion outright orders him to do so. Before he leaves, Tyrion comforts Pod by saying he is the most loyal squire anyone could hope for.\n\nWhen Brienne of Tarth is tasked by Jaime Lannister to locate and protect the missing Sansa Stark, he assigns Podrick to act as her squire. Brienne initially rejects the offer, believing that Podrick will simply slow her down. However, Jaime insists that Podrick is not safe in King's Landing and this is a favor for Tyrion. Before Podrick departs with Brienne, Bronn gives him a gift from Tyrion. It is the axe Tyrion used during the Battle of the Blackwater.\n\nWhile on the road, Podrick is having difficulties with his horse, much to the annoyance of Brienne. The two are on their way to the Castle Black, where Brienne believes Sansa has been taken in by her half-brother, Jon Snow.\n\nBrienne tries to get rid of Podrick by releasing him from the vow he swore as her squire, but to no avail. At their campsite, Podrick sets fire to a rabbit he was trying to cook, even though he did not even skin it properly. Brienne questions Podrick about his duties as squire to Tyrion. He tells her his job was mostly pouring wine, alongside other menial tasks. Brienne then asks if Podrick did anything related to combat. Podrick reveals how he killed Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard by shoving a spear through his head when he tried to kill Tyrion. Brienne then allows Podrick to help her remove her armor.\n\nLater on, Podrick and Brienne stop at an inn where they are served kidney pie made by none other than Hot Pie, who proceeds to tell them at length the process in finding the right ingredients. He then asks of Brienne's business, to which she replies that she is in Catelyn Stark's service to find and protect Sansa Stark.\n\nHot Pie leaves after addressing the Starks as traitors. As Brienne and Podrick prepare to leave the inn, Podrick reminds Brienne that telling people of their quest could be dangerous, but Brienne's honesty is swiftly rewarded when Hot Pie approaches and gives them a baked good shaped like a direwolf. He tells them that he knows nothing of Sansa but last saw Arya alive and hints that she was being sought by the Hound. Podrick, having memorized the complex family trees of the Great Houses, suggests that they head to the Eyrie, realizing that Lysa Arryn is the Hound's only remaining chance of a ransom.\n\nAfter a night's rest, Brienne and Podrick discover their horses have disappeared. Brienne blames her companion for not hobbling them correctly and forces him to carry the saddle bags. Later, Brienne encounters a young girl practicing with a thin sword and the two briefly bond over their shared interests.\n\nHowever, the situation turns hostile when Podrick correctly identifies the girl's companion as Sandor Clegane. Brienne realizes the girl is none other than Arya Stark and tells her that she swore her mother to keep her safe. Sandor, seeing Brienne with a sword forged in a style typical of swords made for the Lannisters, refuses to hand over Arya to Brienne and believes that she is merely here for the bounty on his head. Even after Brienne convinces him this is not the case, Sandor still refuses, impugning Brienne's ability to protect Arya. Brienne and Sandor engage in a vicious duel, while Podrick watches instead of keeping an eye on Arya. Brienne emerges victorious, but the two have lost sight of Arya.\n\nAfter failing to relocate Arya, Podrick questions Brienne if they intend to journey to Castle Black to see if Sansa Stark has been taken in by her half-brother Jon Snow. Brienne dismisses the idea of the two of them continuing to travel together, as Podrick is now hundreds of miles from the dangers of King's Landing. Podrick wishes to remain with Brienne as her squire in order to locate Sansa, but she sharply reminds him that she is not a knight, nor his mother. Brienne laments that the only thing she ever wanted was to fight for a lord she believed in, but now all the good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.\n\nWhile resting at an inn, Podrick spots Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark on the other side of the inn, surrounded by knights. Although she has dyed her hair, Podrick tells Brienne that he is confident that the girl sitting with Petyr is Sansa. Unfortunately, the situation turns ugly after Sansa rejects Brienne's offer of protection. Brienne and Podrick are forced to flee on horseback from their pursuers. Podrick is separated from Brienne and is reared off his horse before being attacked by one of the guards. Fortunately, Brienne saves him by killing the two guards sent after them and orders Podrick get back on his horse. Even though Podrick reminds her that both Stark girls have rejected her offer of protection, Brienne is adamant about following Sansa.\n\nBrienne and Podrick witness Petyr and Sansa approach Moat Cailin. Realizing that following them through the castle would be futile, she decides to bypass the Moat Cailin by going around. Although Podrick is worried about losing sight of them, Brienne tells him that they don't need to follow them so closely because she knows where they are going.\n\nMaking camp, Brienne learns how Podrick became Tyrion Lannister's squire. During the War of the Five Kings he squired for a knight named Lorimer who stole a ham while drunk, which he shared with Podrick. Just before he was to be hanged, Podrick was spared when Lord Tywin heard his family name, pardoned him, and sent him to squire for Tyrion as punishment for both of them, although Podrick was quite happy in Tyrion's service. While Brienne assumes that Podrick must hate being in her service, he is actually proud to be her squire and admires her martial prowess. Brienne apologizes for her rude behavior towards Podrick and offers to teach him how to wield a sword and ride a horse properly: though she can't knight him, she will teach him how to defend himself.\n\nBrienne then reveals her past with Renly Baratheon to Podrick. He tells her that Tyrion acknowledged Renly as a good man, but wonders if the rumors about Renly were true. Brienne admits she knew that Renly was only interested in men. She says that there is nothing more hateful than failing to protect the ones you love and intends to avenge Renly by killing Stannis Baratheon, whom she believes played a role in Renly's murder.\n\nBrienne and Podrick finally reach Winterfell and get a room in a nearby inn at Winter town. Podrick suggests that Sansa may be safe from the Lannisters in her childhood home, but Brienne, knowing of the atrocities that Roose and Ramsay Bolton have committed towards other Houses, corrects him by claiming that Sansa is in danger, even if she doesn't know it. They meet an old servant whom Brienne deduces is still loyal to the Starks, and has him send a message to Sansa for them.\n\nBrienne and Podrick continue to wait for Sansa's signal, watching the window of the tower at every opportunity. While returning from a supply run, he sights Stannis Baratheon and his army marching to Winterfell. Recognizing them from the banners he had seen during the Battle of Blackwater, he returns to their camp and informes Brienne about Stannis, causing them to abandon their lookout and go after Stannis.\n\nAfter Brienne kills Stannis, she and Podrick find Sansa and Theon Greyjoy just as they are surrounded by Bolton soldiers and Ramsay's hounds in the woods. Podrick, his fighting skills having improved under Brienne's tutelage, fights and kills a Bolton soldier, but falls off his horse in the process. He then challenges another Bolton soldier and is knocked to the ground, but is saved by Theon, who stabs the soldier from behind. He and Theon witness Brienne pledge her service to Sansa, with Podrick guiding Sansa through her part of the pledge. After resting, Podrick and Brienne decide to escort Sansa to meet her half-brother Jon Snow at Castle Black. Theon however decides to part company and return to his family in the Iron Islands.\n\nPodrick, Brienne and Sansa eventually reach Castle Black, where he witnesses Sansa's reunion with Jon. Podrick later shares a meal with Jon, Brienne, Sansa, Eddison Tollett, and Tormund, during which Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton, demanding Sansa back on threat of harming him and his friends.\n\nWhen Jon and Sansa decide to fight Ramsay instead of accepting his terms, Podrick accompanies Brienne to the Riverlands to recruit Sansa's great-uncle Brynden Tully and the rebuilt Tully army to aid them. While Brienne is talking to Jaime in his tent, Podrick waits outside, where he is restrained from behind by Bronn and put in a headlock. He is soon released by the sellsword, who tells him he is surprised Podrick is still alive, and notes that he is still a squire. Bronn asks him if he thinks Brienne and Jaime are having sex inside the tent. After Podrick denies it, Bronn asks Podrick if he has had sex with Brienne, which he also denies. He asks Podrick if he knows how to fight. Podrick says he does, stating that Brienne has been teaching him, so Bronn tests him. When he gets Podrick into a stance, he slaps him, and corrects him. After the siege ends, Brienne and Podrick are last seen escaping Riverrun in a boat.\n\nPodrick and Brienne return to Winterfell in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bastards, with House Stark once again ruling Winterfell with Jon Snow as the King in the North. They witness Jon's declaration of their coming war against the Night King, and Jon pardoning Houses Umber and Karstark in return for their fealty to House Stark over Sansa's objections. Podrick later trains with Brienne in the Winterfell courtyard but is unable to best her. Tormund appears and momentarily distracts her, allowing Podrick to strike Brienne, who punches him to the ground in retaliation without hurting him seriously. Tormund quips to Podrick that he is a \"lucky man\".\n\nSansa, Bran and Arya - three of the remaining Stark children - proceed back to Winterfell's castle courtyard together, with Arya pushing Bran in his wheelchair. Brienne and Podrick see them from afar, all three of Catelyn Stark's surviving children reunited. Pod says Catelyn would be proud of Brienne, but she chides that she did next to nothing. Pod says he disagrees with \"my lady\", and Brienne starts to correct him that she doesn't consider herself a \"lady\", but then stops halfway and just thanks him for the compliment.\n\nSome time later, Brienne is going through a vigorous sword practice session with Podrick, knocking him down when he overextends himself. Impressed, Arya interrupts and says she'd like to spar with Brienne - the woman who beat the Hound in combat. When Sansa sends Brienne to King's Landing to represent her before Cersei, Brienne admits to Sansa that Podrick has become a capable fighter and suggests leaving him in Winterfell to protect her, but Sansa refuses. Upon arriving to King's Landing, Podrick is reunited with Bronn and later with Tyrion Lannister, stating that he is glad to see his former lord again. He accompanies them to the Dragonpit but does not attend the discussions, leaving with Bronn with Brienne's approval. After the negotiation is ended, he presumably accompanies Brienne back to Winterfell.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Podrick_Payne"}}

It is believed that only those of Targaryen blood can successfully bond with and ride a dragon, so Rhaenyra proclaimed rewards for any commoners on Dragonstone who could successfully bond with one of the unclaimed dragons - specifically Targaryen bastards and descendants of Targaryen bastards who had been fathered over the years on commoners of the island by young Targaryen princes.\n\nNettles was one of only four of the so-called dragonseeds to successfully bond with a dragon, Sheepstealer. She cleverly managed to gain his trust by bringing him gifts of freshly killed sheep until he gradually became accustomed to her presence.\n\nNettles rode her dragon throughout the rest of the war. After the capture of King's Landing, she accompanied Rhaenyra's husband (and uncle) Daemon Targaryen with his dragon Caraxes, as they hunted through the Riverlands for Prince Aemond Targaryen on the great dragon Vhagar.\n\nEventually, however, after two of the other dragonseeds betrayed Rhaenyra at Tumbleton, she grew paranoid and began to distrust all of the bastard dragonriders, and sent a letter calling for the young girl's head. Particularly, it was said that Daemon himself had taken Nettles as a lover. Daemon was disgusted when he heard of the order: Nettles managed to depart in safety on her dragon, while Daemon issued a challenge to Aemond to come and face him alone.

Both eventually head outside where some of the Whitehall men make fun of Rodrik. During the funeral for Gregor and Ethan, Talia sings a passionate ballad concerning their deaths and how House Forrester will continue to fight on.\n\nAs Rodrik wakes up, following a dream of battle, Talia rushes into his room saying the Whitehills are assembling in the courtyard and that he has to do something. As Rodrik prepares, Talia says she will check on their mother.\n\nTalia is waiting for Rodrik alongside Elissa, Royland, Duncan and Ortengryn. As Rodrik tries to get to the bottom of the situation Harys, a Whitehill soldier, burns a cart to catch their attention as Gryff Whitehill makes himself known. Talia watches on in concern as her brother and Gryff butt heads and Gryff's men head into the Great Hall, claiming it for their own.\n\nA few days later, Talia catches a Whitehill soldier stealing from the Forresters' kitchen. She tells him to stop, but he lays his hands on her and she defends herself by biting him. The soldier reports her to Gryff, who drags her out into the courtyard to punish her in front of Rodrik. Rodrik can either say she defended herself or made a mistake, but Talia stands up for herself either way.\n\nTalia stands up to Gryff, enraging him, but Duncan stops Talia from being hurt by intervening and pleading that Gryff forgives her. He claims that no one questions Gryff and that Talia's outburst was merely due to the passions of youth. Gryff is pleased with this and says he likes Duncan, claiming that the castellan is his man and loyal dog. He shoves Duncan to one side and Rodrik can either punch Gryff or defend Duncan's honor.\n\nRoyland commends Talia's bravery when she stands up to Gryff, saying she is smart, wise, and knows how to tell it like it is. Gryff becomes enraged and says that she should know her station, grabbing Talia's arm and throwing her into the mud. Rodrik then has the option to punch Gryff or help Talia. If Talia is helped, she thanks Rodrik and watches from the sidelines.\n\nGryff knocks Rodrik to the ground in an attempt to teach him when to know he is beaten. While Rodrik is down on the ground, Talia begs Rodrik to get up and not give Gryff the satisfaction of beating him. Gryff gloats, knowing Rodrik is at his mercy, and speaks of Ethan. He says how Ramsay Snow taught Ethan a lesson, and that he may have to teach Talia unless Rodrik stays down.\n\nRegardless of whether Rodrik keeps getting up or stays down, he takes the punishment in Talia's place, sparing her from Gryff's wrath. If Rodrik stays down Talia believes that he let Gryff win.\n\nRodrik and Talia meet later, overlooking the courtyard. Talia remarks that Gryff is strolling around like he owns the place, but he's let his guard down. She asks whether Gryff got what he wanted, or Rodrik did.\n\nShe admits that she told Ethan not to change, but is now aware that it was foolish of her. She tells Rodrik that she is ready to change, and is prepared to do anything for House Forrester. Gregor Forrester used to say that the Forresters are as tough as the Ironwood - all of them.\n\nRodrik can say a time might come where Talia's help is needed, but it is not right now. He says he is unsure of what the future may bring, but the Forresters will stand tall.\n\nTalia is first seen watching Royland and Rodrik practicing their sword technique. She observes Royland teaching Rodrik a move which should bring Gryff down to his level during their next encounter. Duncan arrives with Elaena and Arthur Glenmore, prompting Talia to greet them both and then depart.\n\nAfter Gryff's capture thanks to the aid of the Glenmores, Talia and Rodrik speak about how the latter dealt with the Whitehills and Gryff in particular. She is worried that word will get out about the treatment of their prisoners but Elissa assures her that the Whitehills will not find out. Duncan and Royland arrive, giving Rodrik a message from Lord Whitehill discussing the possibility of a truce and inviting him to Highpoint. After Royland and Duncan depart, Talia vouches for Royland saying that if Rodrik is going behind enemy lines, he needs his master-at-arms with him. While she knows she can't come to Highpoint, she tells Rodrik that she still wants to help and he can tell her she is acting lord of Ironrath in his absence, should look out for the traitor, or should hide in the grove. Now with a purpose, Talia departs.\n\nWhen Rodrik returns to Highpoint, he and his group find the place deserted. Rodrik immediately yells for Talia and whoever else was left at Ironrath, and the group hear laughter coming from the great hall. Rodrik tells the others to wait, then heads inside. As he gets to the hall, he hears someone saying that he told a joke, and Talia apologises, saying she should have laughed. Rodrik enters and sees Ramsay Snow in the Lord's chair, taunting Talia and telling her to sing Ethan and Gregors' funeral song. She refuses but this tests Ramsay's patience. Looking round, Talia sees Rodrik and calls out to him, prompting Ramsay to start goading him on. Ramsay tells Rodrik he and Talia were having a lovely time, then forces Talia to say the same. He tells Rodrik he's heard he can't be broken and has decided to see for himself.\n\nTalia is first seen still sitting at the table with Ramsay. The bastard taunts Rodrik, saying that his father is looking to make a match for him and that he could marry Talia or Elissa Forrester. Bored of that, he then tells Rodrik to walk with him, relieving him of his sword, and orders Talia to come too.\n\nLed by Ramsay, the three of them make their way to the Grove. Ramsay grabs Talia's hand, making her uncomfortable and leaving her to look to Rodrik for support as the two lords talk about the matter of Gryff Whitehill and the Glenmores. When their conversation is over, Ramsay leads them into a clearing where Arthur Glenmore is being flayed. Talia cries out and begs for mercy as Ramsay chuckles and asks Rodrik if he really thought he  would be paying the price for his disobedience. He tells Talia to watch and learn, but Rodrik can shield her if he chooses. Once Ramsay leaves, Talia is left crying and holding onto her brother.\n\nThe following day, Talia walks in on Rodrik and Elaena if they spent the night together. She looks away, embarrassed, and informs Rodrik that she needs to tell him something in private. Once Elaena has left Talia tells her brother that she had a nightmare, woke up and went back to the grove - only to find that someone was there. She shows Rodrik a report and they quickly deduce there is a traitor. They didn't see her, but she saw him. She asks Rodrik to promise that he will slay the council member for betraying the house, then takes him to the great hall where the traitor is waiting.\n\nRodrik tells Talia to get the guards and she leaves the hall, returning with Elissa and two guards. Rodrik's sentinel comes in and tells him that Gryff and the Whitehill Garrison has been released, and the traitor says it was for the good of the House. Talia protests, mentioning Ryon, and Rodrik makes his decision on what to do with the traitor. If he kills the man, Talia will say it was the right thing, but if he spares him, she will walk away, frustrated. After Rodrik makes plans to go to the coast and reunite with Asher, Talia is not seen for the remainder of the episode.\n\nIf Rodrik survived the ambush, Talia is glad to see him return to Ironrath but saddened by Asher's death. She appears again later when Rodrik returns from Ludd's camp, asking where her mother is, and is told to flee to safety.\n\nIf Asher survived the ambush, Talia is pleased to see him but distraught over Rodrik's death, particularly so if she criticised him over his decision on how to deal with the traitor. She is present when Asher becomes the Lord of House Forrester and earns the Forrester Sword. When Ludd arrives outside Ironrath and proposes that Asher marry Gwyn to end the bloodshed, Talia is adamant that they reject the offer and kill Ludd. When the House members decide to trick the Whitehills and are debating how to kill Ludd, Talia expresses support for Beskha's suggestion that they poison his wine, and even offers to pour it herself. It is ultimately up to the player to decide which method to use. If the player chooses to ambush the Whitehills, Talia is not present during the scene in the Great Hall and her absence is one of the details that makes Ludd suspicious. If the player chooses to poison Ludd, she pours the wine as promised and, should the player choose not to intervene, witnesses her mother drink some of the poisoned wine to quell Ludd's suspicions, to which she is distraught. As the Battle of Ironrath begins, Talia is told to flee to safety. If Asher was true to his word about going through with the marriage, Gwyn goes with her.\n\nIn the epilogue, Talia is seen in the clearing with Duncan\/Royland\/Gwyn when a severely wounded Rodrik\/Asher arrives on horseback.\n\n\u200B\n\nSpoken by Talia\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Talia_Forrester"}}

They are a fiercely independent seafaring people who chafe at the rule of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms.","Like the Northmen, the ironborn are descendants of the First Men, but while their mainland cousins adopted the Old Gods of the Children of the Forest, the ironborn worship a deity known as the Drowned God. The Drowned God is said to have created the ironborn to reave and raid and carve out their names in blood and song. When the Andals invaded Westeros, they conquered the Iron Islands as well, but instead of converting the ironborn, the Andals that settled on the Islands were absorbed into the local culture, adopting their religion and way of life as their own.","The Iron Islands are ruled by House Greyjoy from the castle and island of Pyke. Lord Balon Greyjoy rules the Islands. His only surviving son and heir is Theon Greyjoy who was formerly a ward and hostage of Lord Eddard Stark at Winterfell.","George R.R. Martin has frequently compared the ironborn to Vikings from the real-life Middle Ages. Given the analogy that the entire continent of Westeros is supposed to be an oversized version of the British Isles, the ironborn also loosely correspond to celtic raiders from medieval Ireland, as well as raiders from other outer islands in the group (the Isle of Man, the Orkneys, the Shetlands, etc.). Of course, at various points in history, the Vikings established permanent raiding bases in Ireland and the outer isles, so often these raids were from Vikings who lived in Ireland."],"name":"Ironborn","description":"The modern ironborn are an intermingling of the blood of the original First Men settlers of the islands and the Andals who followed six thousand years later. While the Andals and the Faith of the Seven came to dominate everywhere else below the Neck, they found less purchase on the Islands. While a few converts to the Faith of the Seven may be found there even in the present day, most of the Andal invaders converted to the native deity, the Drowned God, instead. The Andal invaders completely acculturated to the distinct \"ironborn\" culture, and their invasion had relatively little impact upon the Iron Islands. Thus the ironborn are ethnically composed of the same First Men\/Andal mix as most of the rest of Westeros: they are culturally, not ethnically distinct.\n\nOne of the few notable changes was that the ironborn switched to speaking the Common Tongue of the Andals. On the other hand, the independent First Men of the North also eventually took up using the language of their Andal neighbors through cultural proximity, not because it was imposed upon them, and therefore it might be wrong to say that the Andals even \"forced\" the ironborn to speak their language.\n\nIn the present day, the ironborn generally think of their distinct culture as stretching back without interruption to the Dawn Age, long before the Andals arrived. Even back then, however, their culture had developed so differently from their First Men cousins who were on the mainland that the ironborn only consider themselves to have truly \"originated\", culturally, on the Iron Islands themselves.\n\nFor centuries, the ironborn pillaged the western coasts of Westeros, which they refer to as the \"Green lands\", and conquered various coastal territories, building a far-flung maritime empire, whose size fluctuated depending on the constantly shifting political climate on the continent. About three generations before the War of Conquest, the ruling House Hoare led the ironborn to conquer the Riverlands, which had previously been conquered by the Stormlands three centuries before. After driving out the Storm Kings, they spent decades forcing their new thralls in the Riverlands to build the largest castle on the entire continent: Harrenhal. Almost the size of a small city, Harrenhal was meant to ensure lasting ironborn domination of the Riverlands.\n\nThe last stone of Harrenhal was laid during the rule of King Harren Hoare - unfortunately, the very same day that Aegon the Conqueror landed on the eastern coast of Westeros with a Targaryen army and his dragons. Tywin Lannister told Arya Stark that a million men could have marched against Harren at Harrenhal, and they would have failed to take the castle. Against Aegon's dragons, however, Harrenhal's high walls were useless, and Harren and all of his sons were roasted alive in their tower by the fire of Aegon's dragon Balerion the Black Dread. Meanwhile the local Riverlands Houses rose up in a revolt led by House Tully to support the Targaryens in overthrowing their hated ironborn overlords. Their armies defeated and House Hoare destroyed, the surviving ironborn Houses bent the knee to Aegon. Now-King Aegon asked the remaining ironborn noble Houses to choose one of their number to rule over the Iron Islands under the overall authority of the Iron Throne, and they chose House Greyjoy of Pyke.\n\nThe ironborn consider reaving and piracy to be their birthright, and fear that three centuries of peace under the Iron Throne has destroyed their heritage and removed their edge, especially as the Seven have found more purchase on the Islands since the Targaryen invasion. Nine years before the War of the Five Kings, to reverse this trend, Lord Balon Greyjoy declared independence in the Greyjoy Rebellion but was soundly defeated. Since then the Ironborn remained quiet vassals of the Iron Throne.\n\nSince the defeat of the Greyjoy Rebellion, Theon Greyjoy, Balon's third son and heir, has lived as a ward of Lord Eddard Stark at Winterfell, the seat of House Stark. Despite his cordial relationship with the Starks, Theon resents his status as a hostage. Later, Theon accompanies the Stark forces to the Riverlands in the War of the Five Kings and gains the trust of Robb Stark, Ned's eldest son and the King in the North.\n\nKing Robb sends Theon Greyjoy back to the Pyke to secure an alliance with his father Balon in order to attack King's Landing. However, Lord Balon has different ideas and plans to use the War of the Five Kings to invade the North. Under pressure from his father and sister Yara Greyjoy, Theon renounces his allegiance to Robb and is baptized by a Drowned Men priest. During the invasion, Yara leads a fleet that attacks Deepwood Motte, the seat of House Glover. Meanwhile, Theon struggles to gain the respect of the Ironborn crew of the Sea Bitch, who resent him for spending his adolescence away from the Iron Islands. Theon finds help in the form of his first mate Dagmer Cleftjaw. Together, the two Ironborn devise a plan to lure the main Stark forces away from Winterfell by launching a feint attack on Torrhen's Square. Against the wishes of Balon and Yara, Theon seizes Winterfell and captures Robb's younger brothers Bran and Rickon Stark. However, the boys escape with the help of the Wildling servant Osha and stable boy Hodor.\n\nIn retaliation, Theon kills two orphan boys and poses their corpses as those of Bran and Rickon. Theon's actions has the effect of inflaming northern resistance to the Ironborn and embarrassing Balon and Yara. Yara travels from Deepwood Mote to Winterfell and attempts to reason with Theon. However, Theon insists on keeping his prize and remaining the Prince of Winterfell.\n\nTheon and the twenty\u2013men Ironborn garrison at Winterfell are besieged by a Bolton army led by Ramsay Snow, the illegitimate son of Roose Bolton, a vassal of the Starks. Theon attempts to rally his men for a final stand but is knocked out by Dagmer, who intends to hand over his liege to the Boltons in return for the garrison being offered safe conduct. However, Ramsay reneges on the offer and has Dagmer and his men flayed alive. By capturing Theon, Ramsay has gained an important hostage since the former is the last surviving son and Balon's heir.\n\nAfter capturing Theon Greyjoy, Roose Bolton falsely claims that the Ironborn had sacked Winterfell and then fled before Ramsay's army arrived. Meanwhile, Theon is tortured over a prolonged period and emasculated by Ramsay, who also forces him to adopt the persona \"Reek.\" Acting in his father's absence, Ramsay issues an ultimatum to Lord Balon demanding that he withdraw from the North. Ramsay also threatens to mutilate Theon and to flay every Ironborn in the North if Balon rejects his terms. In response, Balon disowns Theon and refuses to abandon the strongholds he has conquered. However, Yara disagrees and assembles a band of Ironborn warriors to rescue her brother.\n\nRamsay's emasculation of Theon complicates Roose Bolton's plans to secure an Ironborn withdrawal from the Northern fortress of Moat Cailin, a strategic bottleneck which blocks the return of Bolton forces to the North. Since Theon cannot further the Greyjoy line, he is of no use to Balon. Later, Yara launches a raid on the Dreadfort to rescue Theon. Totally subservient to his master, Theon resists Yara's rescue attempt and chooses to remain with his master. Yara and her surviving forces are forced to retreat when Ramsay unleashes his dogs on them.\n\nBy assuming the persona of Theon, \"Reek\" convinces the Ironborn garrison at Moat Cailin to lay down their arms in return for safe passage. However, Ramsay reneges again on his offer and has the Ironborn there flayed alive. While Roose is uneasy with his son's brutal tactics, he still legitimizes Ramsay. Both surmise that the Ironborn forces in the North are on the retreat.\n\nHaving escaped the Boltons with Sansa Stark, Theon elects to return to the Iron Islands rather than accompany Sansa, Brienne of Tarth, and Podrick Payne to Castle Black. Theon fears that Jon Snow will seek retribution against him for the purported deaths of Bran and Rickon as well as the true deaths of the two orphans. Meanwhile, the end of the War of the Five Kings allows the Glovers to retake Deepwood Motte and slaughter the Ironborn garrison there. As a result, the Ironborn lose their last major stronghold in the North. In Pyke, Yara urges her father Balon to end the war and seek peace. However, Balon is unmoved and insists on fighting to the bitter end. Later that night, Balon is murdered by his estranged younger brother Euron Greyjoy, who intends to succeed his brother on the Salt Throne. The following day, Balon's corpse is found by Yara and her uncle Aeron Greyjoy. After the funeral, Yara swears vengeance against her father's murderer and vows to succeed him on the Salt Throne. However, Aeron informs her that a kingsmoot will decide the next leader of the Ironborn.Theon returns to Pyke and pledges to support his sister Yara's claim to the Salt Throne following a tense reunion. At the Kingsmoot, Yara wins the support of many of the Ironborn by vowing to build a mighty fleet to conquer the mainland. However, Yara is outmanuevered by her uncle Euron who wins the Kingsmoot by proposing an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons. While Euron is being baptized by Aeron, Yara, Theon, and their supporters flee on the best ships in the Iron Fleet. After his coronation, Euron orders the Ironborn to chop down every tree and build a new fleet. He also calls for all the Ironborn women to weave sails for the ships. Finally, he also vows to kill his niece and nephew.\n\nYara, Theon, and their supporters taking a portion of the Iron Fleet to Essos. Yara plans to sail to Meereen and forge an alliance with Daenerys before their uncle can arrive. On the way, they stop over for rest and relaxation at the Free City of Volantis. Yara and several Ironborn crew fraternize with prostitutes.\n\nAfter the Second Siege of Meereen, Yara and Theon arrive and speak with Daenerys and Tyrion in the Great Pyramid. Despite Tyrion's dislike of Theon, Yara convinces Daenerys to accept their ships as opposed to Euron's, noting that Euron's offer is one of marriage. Yara requests that the Iron Islands be independent once again, and Daenerys agrees to help them retake their homeland if they fight for her claim to the Iron Throne. The siblings are later seen on one of the Ironborn ships in Daenerys's fleet as it sails across the Narrow Sea.\n\nAt the invitation of the newly-crowned Queen Cersei Lannister, Euron Greyjoy sails with his portion of the Iron Fleet to King's Landing. He meets with Queen Cersei and her brother Jaime Lannister. Since they share common enemies, Euron proposes forming an alliance to kill their estranged relatives, who have allied themselves with Queen Daenerys Targaryen. Cersei accepts Euron's alliance offer but is reluctant to marry him until he has proven his reliability.\n\nPrincess Yara's Iron Fleet is later dispatched by Queen Daenerys and her Hand Tyrion Lannister to transport Dornishmen and House Tyrell forces across the Narrow Sea for the planned siege of King's Landing. However, Euron's Iron Fleet ambushes them in the high seas. Many of Yara's warriors are slaughtered during the battle and her fleet is destroyed. Euron takes Yara captive but Theon manages to escape by jumping into the sea.\n\nTheon is rescued by an Ironborn ship loyal to Yara. Meanwhile, Euron leads a victory parade in King's Landing with his niece Yara as a prisoner. Queen Cersei appoints Euron the commander of her naval forces while Yara is taken into custody. The Iron Fleet later attacks the Unsullied forces that have seize the Lannister seat of Casterly Rock.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ironborn"}}

Several of these were born to noble mothers, and Aegon foolishly legitimized all of them on his deathbed. This placed them in the line of succession after his firstborn, Daeron II Targaryen and led to the Blackfyre Rebellion."],"name":"Great Bastards","description":"null\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aegon the Unworthy was a decadent and corrupt ruler who indulged his passion and whims at every opportunity. He would have any woman he wanted whether they were married or not, and had a total of nine mistresses and as many bastards. It was often joked that while the words of House Targaryen were \"Fire and Blood\", Aegon IV's motto was \"Wash her and bring her to my bed.\" He openly flaunted his mistresses at court, much to the distress of his sister-wife Naerys.\n\nWhen his cousin Baelor reigned, he dissolved his marriage to his sister-wife Daena and imprisoned her in the Maidenvault so the sight of her would not tempt him to carnal thoughts. Aegon was not under any such prohibition and developed a fondness for his cousin Daena. On one occasion he helped Daena escape from the Maidenvault and they conceived a child. Daena refused to say who the father was, and was dubbed 'Daena the Defiant' for her wilfulness. In time she gave birth to a son, Daemon Blackfyre, and Aegon noted with approval that he was growing up to be a strong warrior.\n\nAegon had a total of nine mistresses (not including his cousin Daena):\n\nnull\n\nAegon fathered a daughter on Bellegere Otherys, who succeeded her as Black Pearl of Braavos. She was then succeeded by her own daughter and granddaughter.\n\nAegon fathered Aegor Rivers (later known as \"Bittersteel\") on Barba Bracken. Due to Barba's buxom figure, Aegon named a pair of hills on either side of Pennytree \"Barba's Teats\" in her honor. His next mistress, Melissa \"Missy\" Blackwood, he renamed them \"Missy's Teats\", as Melissa was slender and flat-chested. This only added fuel to the fire of the long-running feud between House Bracken and House Blackwood, and the last is still disputed by the two families during the events of the series. Aegon fathered on Melissa Brynden Rivers (later known as \"Bloodraven\"). Due to Melissa replacing Barba as Aegon's mistress, Bittersteel and Bloodraven grew up with an intense hatred of one another.\n\nSerenei of Lys was Aegon's final mistress, the last daughter from an ancient but impoverished Valyrian noble family. She was cold and haughty towards others at court. Rumors spread that that she was much older than the king, practising dark arts to retain her youth and beauty. She died giving birth to their daughter Shiera Seastar. She grew up to become a famous seductress and had many lovers, including her half-brother Bloodraven. Bittersteel also desired her, though she rejected him. This only intensified the rivalry between Bittersteel and Bloodraven. Like her mother, Shiera was rumored to use dark magic to maintain her beauty and it was also believed that she and Bloodraven engaged in sinister sorcery together.\n\nWhen Aegon died, he legitimized all of his bastards. When Aegon had knighted Daemon at the age of twelve and given him the Valyrian steel sword Blackfyre, talk began that this was a sign that he intended Daemon to be his heir, not his trueborn son Daeron. Daemon was in love with his trueborn half-sister Daenerys, though Daeron refused to allow them to marry as he planned to marry her to Prince Maron Martell and finally bring Dorne into the Seven Kingdoms. Daemon rebelled against Daeron and founded the cadet branch House Blackfyre, hoping to claim the Iron Throne for himself. In the rebellion, Bittersteel took Daemon's side and Bloodraven took Daeron's.\n\nThe rebellion culminated at the Battle of Redgrass Field. Daemon engaged in an immense duel with Ser Gwayne Corbray of the Kingsguard, with Daemon being victorious. He stopped to ensure that Corbray was taken to his maesters and healed. By that time Bloodraven and his longbowmen, the Raven's Teeth, had gained the higher ground on the Weeping Bridge and rained down arrows upon Daemon and his sons Aegon and Aemon, killing them. The Blackfyre army began to flee but Bittersteel rallied them around him and lead another attack. He personally fought a great duel against Bloodraven, taking his left eye in the process. Daeron's sons Baelor and Maekar then arrived with reinforcements, crushing the rebels between them.\n\nBittersteel fled to Essos with Daemon's five remaining sons and founded the Golden Company. For the next hundred years Daemon's descendants continued to plague the Targaryen dynasty until the War of the Ninepenny Kings, where a young Barristan Selmy slew Maelys the Monstrous, the last of the male Blackfyre line, at Stepstones. Bittersteel eventually died and ordered the other members of the Golden Company to preserve his skull in gold. Subsequent commanders of the Company have followed his example.\n\nBloodraven was named Hand of the King and Master of Whisperers for his part in crushing the rebellion. He served Daeron until the latter's death of the Great Spring Sickness, which had also claimed the lives of both sons of Baelor Blackspear, who had been killed in a trial by combat at Ashford. He then served Daeron's son Aerys and was blamed for the plague, drought and rebellion that took place during his reign, though Bloodraven was the man maintaining order in Westeros during this time. Aerys died without issue and since his brother Rhaegel suffered from the infamous Targaryen madness, the throne went to Maekar. For unknown reasons Maekar distrusted Bloodraven and had him locked in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep. When Maekar died his son Aegon succeeded him and had Bloodraven sent to the Wall along with his older brother Aemon as part of an honor guard led by Ser Duncan the Tall. Bloodraven and Aemon both joined the Night's Watch and over the years Bloodraven rose through the ranks and became Lord Commander. He served long and well in this position, but one day he went out alone ranging beyond the Wall, and mysteriously never returned.\n\nDespite having many lovers, Shiera never married. Bloodraven proposed to her dozens of time, but she always rejected him - though she sometimes did share her bed with him.

Lord Commander Janos Slynt learns that Gendry has left the city as a recruit of the Night's Watch and sends this man with another to find him. They track a group of Night's Watch recruits to the Riverlands. The lead gold cloak calls to the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren, asking if he is in command of the group. Yoren ignores the question and tells them that they are a long way from home. He walks across a wooden bridge towards the visitors. The gold cloak reminds Yoren that he asked a question and Yoren says that he asked without manners so he chose not to answer. Yoren grips the blanket that protects the gold cloaks horse from the saddle. The gold cloak produces a scroll and says that it is a royal warrant for one of Yoren's \u201Cgutter rats\u201D. Yoren says that the recruits belong to the Night's Watch and are beyond the reach of kings and queens. The gold cloak moves to draw his sword but is halted when Yoren places the point of his dagger against his femoral artery. Yoren notes that men worry about their throats but often forget about the vulnerability of their lower regions. He tells the gold cloak that he has sharpened the knife and warns him that no-one can save him if the artery is nicked. Yoren takes the man's sword, saying that good steel is always needed on the wall. The recruits have surrounded the gold cloaks, weapons in hand. One of them picks up the sword from the ground. Yoren tells the gold cloak that he has a choice; die there or return to King's Landing and tell his master that they did not find what they were looking for. The gold cloak defiantly shouts that they are looking for Gendry and describes the bull's head helm that he carries.

Tycho points out their weak position and is ready to dismiss them when Ser Davos speaks up, relating how he came into Stannis' service, how the latter is a just man who keeps his word, and how he is the best chance for the Iron Bank to get its money back upon the chaos that would follow the death of the elderly Tywin Lannister. This seems to convince the banker and his colleagues, as they agree to fund Stannis.\n\nTycho receives Mace Tyrell when the latter arrives in Braavos to renegotiate the kingdom's terms with the Iron Bank.

He was the older brother of Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon Stark, and cousin (believed to be half-brother) of Jon Snow. He also adopted a direwolf, whom he named Grey Wind. Robb was declared the King in the North during the War of the Five Kings, after the execution of his father by King Joffrey Baratheon.","Robb was the eldest child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard was the head of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and Lord Paramount of the North, one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms. The Starks rule the region from their seat of Winterfell. Eddard was also the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon. Robb was born at Riverrun and raised at Winterfell. His father left his mother the morning after their wedding to fight in Robert's Rebellion and did not return until after Robb was born. Robb Stark was likely named after Robert Baratheon. He had two younger trueborn brothers, Bran and Rickon, and two sisters, Sansa and Arya.  Robb was also close to his \"bastard half-brother\" Jon Snow, who is actually his cousin and the child of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, and to his father's ward Theon Greyjoy, whom he counted as his best friend outside of the family. He had been trained from childhood to wield a sword and wear armor by Winterfell's Master-at-Arms Ser Rodrik Cassel and was highly proficient with both for his young age. He lived at Winterfell with his family.","Robb, 17, attends the execution of Will, a deserter from the Night's Watch, by his father Eddard Stark. On their way home with Theon, Jon and Bran, they find a litter of newborn direwolf pups. Robb is surprised that there are any direwolves south of the Wall. When their father says they can keep the pups, Robb adopts one of them as his own, naming him Grey Wind. He welcomes King Robert Baratheon to Winterfell with the rest of his family. He helps his mother maintain discipline during the feast, removing his sister Arya when she starts flicking food at Sansa, despite his amusement. Robb displays an antipathy toward Joffrey from the start, noting that he is a \"right royal prick\", and is visibly annoyed when Sansa looks at Joffrey in admiration. Bran is left comatose in a fall, and because of his father's departure for King's Landing and his mother's refusal to leave an unconscious Bran's side, Robb must help Maester Luwin run the castle making new appointments to the castle's staff. When Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel decide that threats from the Lannisters necessitate their departure for the capital, Robb is left in command of Winterfell. Aware that the Lannisters may be behind Bran's injury, Robb later greets Tyrion with hostility, only to be confused when Tyrion gives Bran a special saddle to help him ride. Robb visits a recovering Bran and has to tell him that he will never walk again. Bran says he would rather have died. While taking Bran outside the castle to test his new saddle, Robb and Theon are talking about Robb's future plans, when they realize that Bran has wandered off. Bran has been taken hostage by a band of wildlings, but they are found by Robb who advances on them with a sword. One of the wildlings Stiv holds a knife to Bran's throat and makes Robb drop the sword. Theon kills Stiv with an arrow, which angers Robb as Bran could have been injured. Only one of the wildlings, Osha, is taken prisoner. Osha says that the greatest danger lies north of the Wall, from the White Walkers, not from the Lannisters in the south, but Robb disregards her warning. Following Robert's death and Eddard's arrest in King's Landing, King Joffrey summons Robb to pay him fealty. Robb instead calls his banners, marching House Stark's vassals to war. His youth and inexperience is questioned by Greatjon Umber, who says he will take his armies home. Robb replies that after they win, the Stark army will return to take the lands of House Umber. Enraged, Greatjon starts to draw his sword, but the formidable Northern lord is cowed when Grey Wind attacks and bites off two of his fingers. He laughs it off and becomes one of Robb's most loyal retainers. Robb's army marches south, reuniting with Catelyn and Ser Rodrik along the way and feeding the Lannisters false intelligence on their movements. Robb wins the allegiance of the prickly Lord Walder Frey and his troops by agreeing to marry one of Frey's daughters. He sends a small force of men to distract the main Lannister army under Lord Tywin Lannister at the Battle of the Green Fork. Meanwhile, his main army attacks Jaime Lannister's forces near Riverrun, winning the Battle of the Whispering Wood and taking Jaime as a captive. Robb is devastated by news of his father's death. He and his lords debate supporting either Stannis or Renly's claim to the throne before Greatjon says neither appeals and declares Robb the King in the North. Other lords of both the North and the Riverlands take up the cry. Theon asks Robb to affirm that they are brothers, now and always, and then swears fealty to him.","Robb continues to win victories against the Lannister army. He earns the nickname \"The Young Wolf\" for his ferocity in battle. He keeps Jaime Lannister under guard in his camp to confound attempts to free him. He dispatches envoys to seek alliances on his behalf. He sends Theon Greyjoy to Pyke to treaty with his father Balon Greyjoy. He tasks his mother Catelyn with forming an alliance with King Renly Baratheon in the Stormlands.  Robb sends deliberately disagreeable terms to Queen Regent Cersei Lannister to waste her time.\"The North Remembers\" The terms are rejected as expected.\"The Night Lands\" Robb wins a crushing victory against a Lannister reinforcement host at the Battle of Oxcross. In the aftermath of the battle he is intrigued by a battlefield medic named Talisa.\"Garden of Bones\" Renly is killed just after agreeing to an alliance and Catelyn flees his camp to return to Robb. Renly's men swear fealty to his less agreeable brother Stannis Baratheon. Catelyn returns to Robb's camp and warns him against pursuing Talisa. They are shocked when news arrives that Theon has betrayed Robb and attacked Winterfell. Robb is furious and agrees to let the bastard son of his bannerman Roose Bolton retake the castle. He insists that the safety of his brothers is paramount and demands that Theon be brought before him so that he can execute him personally. Robb wins a further victory at the Battle of the Yellow Fork. His prison cells are filled to overflowing with captives. When Ser Alton returns with Cersei's rejection of his terms, Robb houses him with Jaime. Talisa asks him for help obtaining medical supplies and he invites her to accompany him to negotiate the surrender of the Crag, suggesting that she restock from the castle's stores. While Robb is gone Jaime escapes, killing Alton and Torrhen Karstark. He is recaptured but Lord Rickard Karstark threatens to behead him to avenge Torrhen.\"A Man Without Honor\" Catelyn sends her sworn sword Brienne of Tarth to exchange Jaime for her captive daughters without consulting Robb. Robb is furious at the betrayal and orders Catelyn kept under guard. He sends men to find Jaime and devises a plan for Roose's bastard son; offer mercy to Theon's men if they deliver the Ironborn prince so they will abandon him, allowing him to retake Winterfell with minimal bloodshed. Talisa comforts Robb, revealing more of her past. He confesses not wanting to marry into House Frey and they sleep together. Robb confesses his love for Talisa to Catelyn. Catelyn warns against betraying his oath to marry a daughter of House Frey. Robb rejects her counsel, and in a secret ceremony conducted by a Septon of the Faith of the Seven, he and Talisa secretly marry.","Robb's army arrives at the Twins, the castle seat of House Frey, for his uncle Edmure's wedding. Enduring Lord Walder Frey's insults directed at him and his wife, Robb makes a public apology to Lord Frey's daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them. Frey accepts the apology and offers the Starks and their men his hospitality. That night Edmure is introduced to his bride Roslin Frey, discovering much to his relief that she is a beauty. The wedding and the feast that follows it are quite celebratory and lively affairs, with all the participants in high spirits. As the celebrations reach their heights Lord Walder calls for the bedding ceremony. Robb agrees and the bride and groom are carried off to their wedding bed, Roslin carried off by the male guests and followed closely by Edmure, who is collected by the Frey women.  After they leave and the festivities begin to wind down, Catelyn becomes suspicious when she notices Black Walder Rivers close the banquet hall doors and the musicians in the gallery begin playing \"The Rains of Castamere\"- the song commemorating House Lannister's brutal elimination of House Reyne . Walder rises to make a toast to Robb, and Catelyn, seated beside Lord Roose Bolton, notices that the latter is wearing mail under his clothing. Realizing they are in a trap, Catelyn slaps Roose across the face and screams a warning to Robb, but by then it is too late. Lord Walder signals his men to attack. Lothar draws a knife and repeatedly stabs the pregnant Talisa in the stomach, fatally wounding her and killing their unborn child. Before he can react, Robb is shot by the musicians with crossbows several times and falls to the ground. Numerous other Stark men are killed by the assassins or Frey men. Robb crawls towards Talisa despite his injuries and manages to hold her in his arms, but he sees that she is dead.  Catelyn, having been wounded by a crossbow bolt, manages to take Joyeuse Erenford hostage, threatening to kill her if Walder doesn't spare Robb, who lingers despondent beside his wife's corpse. Walder refuses, dismissing his wife as replaceable. Robb then somehow finds the strength to drag himself back onto his feet, barely, and weakly calls out \"Mother!\" to her in a daze. As Catelyn looks into Robb's eyes, Roose Bolton steps in front of Robb and tells him that \"the Lannisters send their regards,\" and stabs Robb through the heart.","Emotionally crushed by the deaths of Robb and Catelyn (the only family she believes she had left, apart from Jon Snow), Sansa refuses to eat despite pleas from Shae. When Tyrion attempts to comfort her, she reveals to him that she can no longer sleep, but instead lies awake all night thinking about how her mother and brother died, having learned that the Freys had sewn Grey Wind's head onto Robb's decapitated corpse and later flung Catelyn's corpse into the Trident to rot. Tyrion tells Sansa that he didn't know Robb very well but the brief time he met him in Winterfell was enough for him to know that Robb was a good man. Having also learned of Robb's death, Jon Snow confides to Samwell Tarly about the last time he saw his brother and how he had been jealous of Robb his whole life for the way his father looked at him, being his trueborn son, something Jon wanted for himself. He adds that even though Robb was better than him at everything when they were young, Jon couldn't hate him even though he wanted to.\" At the Dreadfort, Ramsay Snow has also learned of Robb's death and joins his father in pledging allegiance to the Lannisters. While being shaved by Theon Greyjoy, now going by the name \"Reek\", Ramsay tells him of Robb's death at Roose Bolton's hands and mockingly offers his condolences, knowing full well that Theon loved Robb like a brother. Despite his betrayal, Theon is visibly shocked at the news of Robb's death, and for a moment appears to be on the verge of slitting Ramsay's throat with the razor in retaliation but refrains from doing so since Roose and Locke are also present. Ramsay is also aware of Robb's close relationship with Jon, whom Ramsay claims may be a threat to their hold on the North if he is to seek revenge for Robb's death.","Despite the fact that he had previously participated in a blood ritual out of hope that it would lead to Robb's death, Stannis Baratheon remains disgusted at the manner of Robb's demise and offers to avenge him by killing Roose Bolton in an attempt to sway Jon Snow to his side.\" Later, when Jon is signing request letters to various Houses for new recruits as the newly elected Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he balks at sending one to Roose Bolton, reminding Samwell Tarly that Roose murdered his brother. Though Sam is aware of that and apologizes for presenting Jon with such an unsavory task, he reminds him that the Watch is in dire need of men and supplies, and they cannot get them without help from the Warden of the North. With disgust, Jon reluctantly signs the letter to the Boltons. Meanwhile, Sansa Stark is brought to Winterfell by Petyr Baelish in order to be wed. Initially thinking she was to be married to Roose Bolton, Sansa is mortified at the idea of having to marry the man who murdered her brother. Although Petyr corrected her by informing her that she was to be wed to his son, Ramsay Bolton, this did not make Sansa less displeased about this betrothal. However, she eventually agreed to go along with it under the pretence that Winterfell was her home, and that she would be in a position to avenge her family. When Sansa finally arrives in Winterfell and is greeted by the Boltons, she greets her brother's killer with polite courtesy - although not without hesitation, given her obvious hatred of Roose.\"","Jaime then attempts to reason with Edmure Tully, who had been a Lannister-Frey prisoner in the years following the Red Wedding, to order his men to stand down and to open the gates to the castle. During their discussion, Edmure remarks that he does not understand how Jaime is able to live with himself due to all the horrible things he has done - namely playing a part in murdering his entire family and the conditions of his imprisonment over the past few years. Jaime explains to Edmure his admiration for his deceased sister Catelyn Stark and that he actually admired her far more then he admired Robb or Ned. Jaime eventually threatens to launch Edmure's infant son over the castle walls and the broken Edmure then agrees to order his men to surrender to the Lannister and Frey forces, resulting in the death of the Blackfish and the end of Tully control in the Riverlands - the final remnant of Robb's army.","Later, in the Winterfell throne room, Regent Sansa Stark presides over a meeting of the Northern lords. Saying that the King in the North should stay in the north, Lord Robett Glover and Lord Yohn Royce of The Vale of Arrynpropose that she take over power in the absence of her half-brother Jon Snow. However, Sansa insists Jon Snow is their true ruler who is doing what he believes is right for their people and that she is his regent. Following the meeting, Sansa confides her frustration in the Northern lords with Arya. Arya thinks that she should not let the lords get away with insulting her and hints at assassinating them. Sansa disagrees with Arya's suggestion of killing the troublesome lords. Arya tells Sansa to admit that she is harboring those thoughts. Disturbed at her younger sister's homicidal streak, Sansa tells Arya that she has \"work to do.\"","In the Riverlands, Robb's rule also comes to an end and House Tully is stripped of its ancestral title and home by House Frey with the backing of the crown, the Lannisters and the Boltons. Robb's uncle Edmure Tully is kept prisoner in the years following his wedding. However, Ser Brynden Tully, the \"Blackfish\", continues a guerrilla war against House Frey for control of Riverrun and eventually manages to take control of it back from the Freys. In response, Ser Jaime Lannister under order from King Tommen Baratheon is sent to lay siege to the castle. Using Lord Edmure as a way to override the Blackfish's control, the remaining Tully forces surrender and the Blackfish is killed. House Tully, whose forces are the only remaining remnants of Robb's army, then becomes subservient to the crown and the new lord of the Riverlands, Walder Frey.","See Robb and Talisa Stark","By the time Robb finally decides to return home and fight off the ironborn, it is too late: he lost he North and Wintefell, and as a result of the false news about his brothers, he has breached the pact with the Freys."],"name":"Robb Stark","description":"Robb had a keen sense of honor and justice, which he received from his father. He was fair, caring, and willing to do anything to keep his family safe. Unlike Roose Bolton, one of his central bannermen, Robb saw no reason for torture, cruelty, or unnecessary executions, and treated his prisoners of war well and justly. He did not wish for violence or war and did his best to limit the deaths and casualties on both sides. He also expended tremendous sympathies to innocent victims of war such as Martyn and Willem Lannister.\n\nRobb had a surprisingly keen mind for warfare and strategy, a trait that takes Tywin Lannister completely by surprise, who saw Robb as a stupid child who hadn't the slightest idea of the violence of war and after his first taste of battle would \"run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.\" The Lannisters were quite surprised when Robb led a stunning surprise attack in the Battle of the Whispering Wood to crush the western half of the Lannister armies under Jaime. Tywin also did not expect Robb to have the determination to send hundreds of his own men to their deaths in a feint to the east. Sansa Stark mentions to Joffrey Baratheon that Robb is known to fight with his army's vanguard and commands his forces where the fighting is thickest. As such, Robb's tactical prowess and bravery in battle causes the northerners to see Robb as a larger than life figure and he is quickly known as the \"Young Wolf\" for his ferocity in battle. Robb's actions create lore throughout the Seven Kingdoms that tell tales of him riding his direwolf into battle and even transforming into a wolf himself. Tywin Lannister mentions to his war counsel at Harrenhal that Robb's men worship him and that he doubts Robb will lose unless drastic measures are taken to ensure this.\n\nRobb was very much his father's son, but this means that he has not only his father's strengths but his father's weaknesses. Like Eddard, Robb lacked proper political skills and had a tendency to put honor before reason. He married a political nobody out of love, needlessly spurning a badly needed political alliance with the Freys. Robb also put honor before pragmatic political needs when he executed Lord Rickard Karstark for treason and murder, costing him the Karstark contingent from his army. Like most Northerners, Robb was more proficient as a warrior than as a politician. Much like his own father Ned Stark and the man he was named after, Robert Baratheon, Robb Stark was an excellent warrior and military commander but a poor politician.\n\nRoose Bolton viewed Robb as both arrogant and foolish, and Walder Frey considered Robb's title as the Young Wolf to be a show of pomposity. Despite this, Robb was overall viewed favorably and as good man. He was mourned profusely by Sansa once she heard the news. Even Tyrion Lannister commented to Sansa that Robb seemed like a good man to him. Others high lords such as Stannis Baratheon, Olenna Tyrell and Randyll Tarly viewed the way Robb was murdered to have been absolutely detestable.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Robb_Stark"}}

She is tasked with teaching Daenerys the Dothraki language and customs. Irri tends to Daenerys while she seeks advice on Dothraki customs and stories, and is sceptical of Doreah's story that dragons come from a long-destroyed second moon.\n\nIrri acts as a translator between Daenerys and her bodyguard Rakharo. Rakharo protects Daenerys from one of her brother Viserys's famous rages by whipping him around his throat, though he respects Daenerys's request not to kill him. Irri and Rakharo show mutual puzzlement at her mercy. Irri determines that Daenerys is pregnant and arranges a special dinner to celebrate. Irri tells Ser Jorah Mormont about Daenerys's pregnancy as she demands Rakharo to find something different than horseflesh for the meal.\n\nIrri tends to Doreah after Viserys beats her. Irri burns her hands when she tries to handle a dragon egg Daenerys has put into a fire pit, Daenerys was holding the egg without it affecting her. Irri is present when Viserys threatens Daenerys and her baby and translates his words to Drogo. Irri watches as Viserys is killed by the Khal using molten gold to avoid spilling blood in Vaes Dothrak. Daenerys says that no true dragon could be killed by fire.\n\nIrri is part of Daenerys's retinue as she inspects the markets of Vaes Dothrak. She is there when a wineseller tries to assassinate Daenerys. Jorah foils the attempt and Rakharo captures the man. Irri watches as Drogo swears to invade the seven kingdoms as revenge for the assassination attempt. Irri accompanies Daenerys to Lhazar when the khalasar raids there to obtain slaves to fund crossing to Westeros. Daenerys objects to the rape of the captives and Irri is present when Drogo kills Mago for questioning Daenerys's authority. Drogo takes a small wound in the duel. She helps Dany to care for Drogo when his wound festers. Daenerys' reliance on the healing of Lhazareen godswife Mirri Maz Duur alienates the Dothraki. Daenerys is attacked and injured by Qotho. Daenerys loses her baby and Drogo is left catatonic when she turns to Maz Duur's blood magic. The khalasar splinters without Drogo and Daenerys smothers him to end his suffering. She builds a funeral pyre for him and stakes Maz Duur within the flames to avenge the loss of her son. Daenerys also puts her eggs within the flames and shocks Irri when she walks in after them. The remains of the khalasar stay around the fire all night. In the morning they find Daenerys alive in the ashes with three dragons. Irri swears fealty to Daenerys along with the rest of her people.\n\nIrri crosses the Red Waste alongside the rest of Daenerys's khalasar. Daenerys's silver dies during their journey. Daenerys halts the majority of the column and sends her bloodriders to scout ahead.\n\nIrri is distraught when Rakharo's horse arrives back to the khalasar without him. Jorah Mormont approaches the horse and discovers Rakharo's severed head. She is devastated because, according to Dohtraki belief, unless his body is cremated Rakharo's spirit won't be able to move on to the Night Lands (the afterlife) to ride with his ancestors. Irri is comforted by Daenerys, who tells her that tonight Rakharo will ride with them. Irri was in love with Rakharo.\n\nKovarro returns having reached the city of Qarth. Daenerys leads her people there and is dismayed when she is refused entry by the ruling elders the Thirteen. The khalasar are eventually admitted under the protection of Xaro Xhoan Daxos.\n\nXaro welcomes Daenerys into his home, giving her people accommodation and buying her gifts. Irri watches as Daenerys and Doreah lean on the stone balcony of their new apartment. Drogon is perched on the edge of the balcony with a lump of raw meat between them. Daenerys instructs Drogon to breathe flame on the meat by saying Dracarys, the old Valyrian word for Dragon fire. Drogon does as she commands, charring the meat. Doreah and Daenerys watch the dragon gleefully as he feasts on the cooked morsel. Daenerys says that Drogon will be able to feed himself from now on. Doreah reaches for another lump of meat but Daenerys instructs her to let Drogon sleep. Doreah holds out her hand to help the dragon back into his wooden cage and he climbs onto it. Daenerys tells Doreah that the dragon loves her, eliciting a frown from Irri.\n\nDaenerys joins Irri by her bed and Irri describes the repairs she has made to Daenerys\u2019s clothes. Daenerys thanks Irri, calling her friend. Doreah picks up a dress from the bed and asks if Daenerys has seen it. She tells her Xaro had it made for her and reports hearing that he is the wealthiest man in Qarth. Irri concurs with her fellow handmaiden. Doreah adds that Qarth is the richest city in Essos. Daenerys recalls her gift from Illyrio Mopatis, saying that the last time a rich man gave her a gown it was because he intended to sell her into marriage with Khal Drogo. Irri offers a Dothraki prayer for Drogo to ride forever in the night lands. Daenerys tells Doreah that they know nothing about their host and suggests that men often speak about other men when they are happy, suggesting that Doreah seduce some of Xaro\u2019s fellow citizens to obtain more information. Doreah says that Daenerys would look like a real princess in Xaro\u2019s dress and Irri objects to the title, correcting Doreah that Daenerys is a Khaleesi. Irri breaks the ensuing awkward silence by encouraging Daenerys to wear the dress as a guest\u2019s courtesy to Xaro. Xaro throws a reception for Daenerys in his gardens. Irri and several of the khalasar are also present.\n\nDaenerys discovers that some of her Khalasar have been murdered. She runs to her chamber and discovers Irri strangled to death, her dragons and Doreah missing. Daenerys is devastated at the theft and at being unable to protect Irri. The warlock Pyat Pree reveals that he took the dragons, and she later finds out he was in concert with Xaro. Daenerys also finds out Doreah betrayed her, and had a hand in Irri's death.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Irri"}}

Even then, Vermithor is directly stated to have been the largest and most powerful dragon after Vhagar even at the beginning of the Dance. With Sunfyre also dying of his wounds on Dragonstone, only two other dragons remained, both younger and smaller (apparently third-generation) dragons: Seasmoke (possessed by the Blacks, fleeing to the Riverlands) and Tessarion (ridden by Aegon II's youngest brother Daeron). Seasmoke and Tessarion were of comparable size, both only around a third Vermithor's full size. Thus possession of Vermithor as his mount at this point gave Hugh the idea to proclaim himself king, glibly on the same grounds that Aegon I did during the original Targaryen Conquest: he had the world's largest dragon."],"name":"Vermithor","description":"Vermithor was left riderless on Dragonstone island for many years after the death of King Jaehaerys I. During the Dance of the Dragons, Rhaenyra Targaryen's faction - the Blacks - was based on the island, but realized that they possessed more dragons than riders. It was believed that only those of the Targaryen bloodline could successfully bond with dragons, but over the generations the Targaryens had produced numerous bastard children and grandchildren with the commoners of the isle.\n\nRhaenyra put out a call for any who believed they were a bastard of Targaryen blood to attempt to mount and bond the six riderless dragons, offering reward of gold and title. Many of these bastards - called Dragonseeds - died in the attempt, but ultimately four of them succeeded. Vermithor was claimed by the bastard called Hugh Hammer.\n\nHugh and Vermithor fought on Rhaenyra's side in the civil war for some time, but during its later stages Hugh decided to betray her. When a large Green army of House Hightower advanced towards King's Landing after a long journey up from the south, Rhaenyra sent an army with two dragons to counter it: Vermithor ridden by Hugh Hammer, and Silverwing ridden by Ulf the White. In the ensuing Sack of Tumbleton, however, both Hugh and Ulf switched sides and turned their dragons against Rhaenyra's own army.\n\nLuckily for Rhaenyra, rather than continue to advance on nearby King's Landing, Hugh and Ulf instead chose to drink and whore amid the ruins of Tumbleton with the Green army, unable to agree on what specific course of action to take next.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Vermithor"}}

They are most commonly known by the term \"sellsword\", as they sell their services with a sword."],"name":"Mercenary","description":"Sellswords are professional mercenary soldiers. They usually fight on foot, though they can actually also own horses and fight as mounted warriors.  Notable sellswords:\n\nnull\n\nAlthough mounted sellswords are sometimes called \"freeriders,\" strictly speaking they are not the same thing. The difference is that true freeriders do not fight for regular payment, receiving only a share of the food supplies to sustain them and the promise of a share of the plunder (gold, weapons, armor, etc.). Essentially, they are \"riders\" that fight for \"free\".  Freeriders are usually a motley mix of two drastically different sources. Some freeriders are hedge knights; low-ranking freelance knights unattached to any noble House, and they are fighting for free because they hope that if they distinguish themselves in combat, they will be formally taken into a lord's service as a sworn sword (who gets regular payment). The other kind of freeriders are truly poor hangers-on, usually farm-boys whose homes were burnt out during the military campaign and who joined up with the army because they have nowhere else to go and are only a step above camp followers. This second type are actually by far the most common freeriders. Either way, freeriders are rarely used in direct combat between armies, instead more often serving as scouts and foragers. They can see combat, but this usually takes the form of raids, burning down enemy villages, often as their own homes were once burned down.\n\nNotable Freeriders:\n\nnull\n\nNote: The German dub refers to freeriders as \"freier Ritter\", or \"free knights\". Most freeriders are not actually anointed knights - though a great many freeriders are indeed poor \"hedge knights\". The slight difference in meaning stems from the fact that the German word for \"knight\", ritter, literally means \"rider\". \"Freeriders\" in Westeros can be knights, but they might just be \"riders\" in the sense that they are farm-boys who ride their horses ahead of the main army as scouts. A closer translation into German would probably be \"freier Reiter\" as in \"riders\/scouts\".\n\nSellsails are mercenary sailors who engage in naval battles. Sellsails are the captain and crew of a boat, whose service is the actual operation of their vessel. Of course, the crews of many sellsail ships are also proficient in combat during boarding operations and coastal raids. Sellsails are quite frequently pirates who have decided to make quick money by hiring out the services of their ships during a current conflict, and in return charging far more than they'd normally make in their usual raiding activities. During peacetime, they usually go right back to being regular pirates.\n\nNotable Sellsails:\n\nnull\n\nWhile many sellswords function independently of any larger organization, there are also many sellsword companies which hire out their services as a unit. Again, the quality of these sellsword companies varies across a wide spectrum. Some can be little more than poorly trained gangs of a few dozen men who have combined their strength - though major lords who want to supplement their armies with sellswords will still prefer to hire a pre-assembled collection of such sellswords rather than go through the trouble of hiring them one by one. The best sellsword companies are essentially small private armies, highly trained and serving under their own officers.  While sellsword companies are encountered in Westeros, they are much more common in the city-states of Essos, particularly in the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay. The Seven Kingdoms are predominantly a feudal society, in which each lord raises soldiers from his own lands. In contrast, the Free Cities are an urban society, and thus better fitted to paying coin to mercenaries. As a result, the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay have a much more developed system and history of fielding professional mercenaries organized into independent companies for hire.\n\nNotable Mercenary companies:\n\nnull\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there are actually several more mercenary companies than have been revealed in the TV series so far, several of which have been condensed in adaptation by either changing them to groups of regular soldiers or by combining different sellsword companies into a single group; this was probably done to avoid confusing the TV audience with too many new names, i.e. a sellsword company hired by the Lannisters in the books is changed to simply a group of Lannister soldiers in the TV series. The allegiances of sellsword companies can at times be confusing even within the narrative of the books: mercenaries are a fickle bunch who easily change allegiances multiple times, depending on where the most gold is.\n\nIn the books, Yunkai actually hired two different sellsword companies to defend itself against Daenerys Targaryen, the Second Sons and the Stormcrows, but these were combined in the TV series, so all of the major mercenary captains are from a single company known as the Second Sons. In the books, the Second Sons are led by Mero (as in the TV series), while the Stormcrows are led by Prendahl na Ghezn, Sallor the Bald, and Daario Naharis. Daario killed Prendahl and Sallor to seize leadership of the Stormcrows, and then switched their loyalty to Daenerys. Meanwhile, Daenerys tricked Mero by giving him the large wagon full of wine he requested - for which he would consider, but not promise, to change sides. Daenerys then sent her forces to ambush the Second Sons that same night while Mero and his men were fall-over drunk on the wine she had given them, and most surrendered without a fight. Mero fled during the night and was later killed in a separate incident. The remaining Second Sons voted to have one of their other lieutenants, Brown Ben Plumm, serve as their new captain, and switched allegiances to Daenerys. In the TV series, Mero asked for the wagon of wine but curiously, there was no following ambush during the night as in the novel.\n\nIn the books, the Second Sons and Stormcrows consist of about 500 men each, for a total of one thousand mercenaries. The TV series not only combined the two mercenary companies, but doubled the total number of mercenaries from one thousand to two thousand.\n\nSer Barristan Selmy has a very negative opinion about sellswords, claiming that they are loyal only to themselves and cannot be trusted. During the siege of Meereen, Ser Barristan's statement proves to be correct about the Second Sons who switch sides because their leader Ben Plumm does not wish to fight for the inferior party (but later changes his mind), but not about Daario's Stormcrows who remain loyal to Daenerys even after her departure.\n\nDuring the third book, Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are captured by the infamous sellsword company known as the Brave Companions - an ironic name, as they aren't particularly brave and are most famous for horrifically torturing unarmed prisoners. They become a major set of antagonists in the storyline throughout the third and fourth novels. Their penchant for maiming their captives by amputating their arms and\/or feet has led to them being dismissively nicknamed \"the Footmen\". The Brave Companions are the terror of two continents, infamous across Essos and Westeros as the most ill-reputed, vicious, and cruel sellsword company in existence. They are not well-known for being particularly skilled at arms, but rather are infamous for the atrocities they are willing to commit against the enemy's civilian population. They are normally active in Essos, particularly the Free Cities, but when the War of the Five Kings first broke out Tywin Lannister hired them and brought them to the Riverlands of Westeros to burn out and terrorize the defenseless villages of the smallfolk loyal to his enemies. Even Gregor Clegane's men, including vicious torturers such as the Tickler, are considered to be not quite as despicable as the Brave Companions.\n\nMoreover, the Brave Companions are composed of a veritable rogue's gallery of the absolute lowliest dregs of humanity, with an extremely diverse membership composed of the worst criminals from across the known world: cut throats, murderers, rustlers, rapers, ass-kickers, Qohorik butchers, Ibbenese thieves, Dothraki thugs, Dornish vipers, Braavosi buggerers, a child-molesting Westerosi priest, and a psychotic jester. They ride bizarre black-and-white striped horse-like animals known as zorses (horse-zebra hybrids), which they brought with them from Essos. Their diverse and indeed outlandish appearance has led to them also being nicknamed the \"Bloody Mummers\" (mummers are a kind of wandering troupe of actors), though they think this nickname is insulting. Their leader is Vargo Hoat, a cruel man from Qohor who has a bad speech impediment that leaves him lisping and slobbering. Hoat enjoys cutting the hands and feet off of his captives with little or no provocation, particularly anyone who points out his speech impediment - which, given that his lisp is so bad that it truly makes his speech barely intelligible at times, means that Hoat and the Brave Companions leave piles of severed hands and feet in their wake.\n\nThe known members of the Brave Companions are:\n\nnull\n\nIn the second book, the Brave Companions decide to betray the Lannister forces holding Harrenhal when they discover that the eastern half of the Stark army commanded by Roose Bolton is advancing on the castle, and they'd rather be on the winning side. Hoat is rewarded for the betrayal by being named the (temporary) Lord of Harrenhal, which remains garrisoned by Roose Bolton and his army. After the Battle of the Blackwater, however, it starts to become clear that the Lannisters have gained the upper hand in the war, and Hoat fears - correctly - that Roose Bolton himself wants to end up on the winning side, and will betray Robb Stark to the Lannisters. If Bolton switched his allegiance to the Lannisters, he would hand over Hoat and the Brave Companions to Tywin so he could punish them for their betrayal. Thus when Hoat's men capture Jaime Lannister at the beginning of the third book, he has his men cut off Jaime's sword-hand, in the hope that this will drive a wedge between Jaime's father Tywin and Roose, as Tywin would presumably blame Bolton for the actions of the sellswords under his command. Unfortunately for Hoat, Roose decides to let Jaime continue on to King's Landing if in exchange he will tell his father the truth, that Roose was not responsible for his maiming at the hands of the Brave Companions. The result of maiming Jaime is only that Tywin is even angrier at the Brave Companions than he was before, and Bolton has even less reason to protect them from Tywin's wrath. Roose sends Jaime with Qyburn and Steelshanks to King's Landing, leaving Brienne to Hoat's entertainments.\n\nWhile Brienne is held captive in Harrenhal, Hoat tries to rape her, but she resists and bites off one of his ears, leading him to throw her in the bear pit. Luckily, Jaime and Steelshanks return to Harrenhal in time to save her. Hoat is furious but has no choice but to let Jaime and Brienne go safely, since his men are outnumbered 2:1 by Steelshanks' soldiers, and half of them are too drunk to fight. Hoat's head injury festers and he gradually loses both his sanity and the control over his men.\n\nMeanwhile, Tywin (who has not heard yet about Jaime's maiming) decides it is time to punish the Brave Companions for their betrayal. He sends the Mountain to Harrenhal. As he draws nearer, many of the Brave Companions run away, splitting into small bands, becoming bandits and vagabonds: Urswyck and others head for Oldtown; Pyg, Shagwell and Timeon travel to Maidenpool hoping to board a ship, and later to the Whispers at Crackclaw Point; Rorge, Biter and five more raid Saltpans and other villages in the Riverlands. It is unknown what becomes of Zollo, Togg Joth and Three Toes.\n\nThe Mountain easily takes the undefended Harrenhal. A cook whose leg was severed by Hoat seizes the opportunity to get even by opening a postern gate to the Mountain's men. The Mountain finds Hoat alone, half mad with pain and fever from his festering wound. He kills the few Brave Companions who remain with their leader, but instead of killing Hoat immediately, he cuts his limbs piece by piece as a mockery of Hoat's preferred way of torturing his prisoners, and feeds them to the northern prisoners, mostly to Wylis Manderley, even to Hoat himself. Tywin informs Jaime of this when his son returns to the capital (only then does Tywin learn about Jaime's maiming). The Mountain would have continued torturing Hoat longer, but once he receives orders from Cersei Lannister to return to King's Landing as her champion in Tyrion's Trial by combat for the death of Joffrey, he finishes Hoat off and leaves Harrenhal, placing Polliver as the castellan.\n\nRorge and Biter never encounter The Hound and Arya Stark. Rorge finds the Hound's helm and wears it, causing the spreading of false rumors that the Hound raids the Riverlands. Brienne encounters Rorge's gang near the Inn at the Crossroads, and she recognizes Rorge despite the helm. In the ensuing fight, Brienne kills Rorge and Gendry kills Biter.\n\nThe TV series heavily condensed the entire subplot at Harrenhal, particularly how Arya Stark (with the help of Jaqen H'ghar) aided the capture of the castle by freeing all of the Northern prisoners held there, which spurred the Brave Companions to turn on their Lannister allies sooner than anticipated. Moreover, possibly because it would have involved introducing a very diverse set of characters (meaning too much time would need to be spent designing each of their different cultures), the Brave Companions were cut out of the TV series. The character of \"Vargo Hoat\" was functionally included in the TV series, but was changed to simply be a House Bolton soldier named Locke - keeping the general idea from the books that Vargo Hoat was in service to Roose Bolton at the time Jaime encountered him. Loosely, the Brave Companions were condensed down from being a mercenary company to simply being a particularly vicious group of Bolton soldiers led by Locke.\n\nWriter Bryan Cogman explained how the Brave Companions were condensed to be just a group of particularly vicious House Bolton soldiers, to avoid confusing the TV audience:\n\nLocke's motivation for cutting off Jaime's sword-hand in the TV series was loosely the same: partially it was just because he's a vicious monster who wanted to intimidate Jaime, while partially it was because maiming him would prove that he would never ransom Jaime to Tywin. As it turns out, of course, his commander Roose Bolton realizes that Tywin is winning the war at this point and will eventually hunt down those responsible for maiming his son, so he agrees to let Jaime go to King's Landing if he promises to assure Tywin that Roose himself was not responsible for the loss of his sword-hand.\n\nIn the books, Qyburn, the ex-maester, was a member of the Brave Companions, though he only joined the group as a means to survive, and instead of being a fighter or torturer simply served as the group's primary healer. As in the TV series, he is tasked with treating the infected stump of Jaime's right arm; he remarks that staying with Hoat and the Brave Companions means he has gained much experience in treating the amputated limbs of their victims. In a minor change, because the Brave Companions do not exist in the TV series, Qyburn was simply a prisoner encountered at Harrenhal by the Northern army when they took the castle, who then entered into the service of Roose Bolton. In the books, Robb Stark did not personally go to Harrenhal so Qyburn never encountered him, while in the TV series Robb accompanied Roose to capture Harrenhal. The TV series condensed this so that the Lannisters simply abandoned Harrenhal rather than let Robb bleed their forces more, however Robb left Harrenhal immediately afterwards to attend his grandfather Hoster Tully's funeral. Either way, in the books Qyburn leaves the Brave Companions when Roose sends him to accompany Jaime on his way to King's Landing, to continue to care for his injury.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mercenary"}}

For example, if Eddard Stark ever had Jon Snow legitimized, there is no established rule for whether Jon would go behind or ahead of his younger but trueborn half-brothers Bran and Rickon. In the case of the First Blackfyre Rebellion this was a moot point, because Daemon Blackfyre was not only bastard-born, but simply younger than Daeron II Targaryen.

Jon confides to Samwell Tarly that this was the first thing he ever wanted, often wishing that his father would ask Robert Baratheon to legitimize him (though he never did out of respect for Catelyn), but decides to politely decline Stannis's offer. As Jon explains to Sam, he feels that even if Stannis formally released him from his vow to the Night's Watch, the vow is meant to be taken for life, so he wouldn't make a very good Lord of Winterfell: any future oaths he made as Lord of Winterfell would be doubted and distrusted, if he was even willing to renege on his vow to the Night's Watch.\n\nAlthough Ramsay Bolton has been legitimized as a true Bolton, his status as his father's heir is placed in question when Walda Bolton, Ramsay's stepmother, becomes pregnant with Roose's child, whom Maester Wolkan says will be a boy.

She could be very influential, riding beside her husband as he leads, or she could be worth practically less than the khal's horse; the khal's bloodriders will sometimes share the khaleesi, but would never be allowed to ride the khal's horse.\n\nIt is Dothraki tradition that when a khal dies, his surviving khaleesi must retire to join the crones that rule Vaes Dothrak, known as the dosh khaleen. Daenerys Targaryen, however refused this and instead declared herself a Khaleesi in her own right, forming her own khalasar from what few of Drogo's people hadn't abandoned her.\n\nAs she continued on her journey, Daenerys more formally pressed her claim to the Iron Throne and thus emphasized the title she felt she had a birthright to, Queen of the Andals and the First Men. She nonetheless continued to claim her Dothraki title, and made sure that \"Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea\" was included amongst her titles when she was formally announced. It's not clear where the territorial designation \"of the Great Grass Sea\" comes from; it may originate from Dothraki tradition, but could simply be Daenerys's own attempt to make the title seem more formal.\n\nDaenerys's claim to the khaleesi title was challenged by Khal Moro upon her capture. Since the widow of a khal is by definition a khaleen and not a khaleesi, Moro felt honor-bound to bring her back to Vaes Dothrak.

Although Moro tried to convince the assembled horse lords to let her join the dosh khaleen, Daenerys decried all the khals as weak and killed them in a great conflagration, declaring herself the sole leader of the Dothraki. It is not clear if she is now the only holder of the title, as she had previously indicated that she thought dosh khaleen such as Ornela should still hold the title of khaleesi.Daenerys Targaryen is the first in known Dathroki history and lore to transform the role of khaleesi from consort to sovereign, regardless if any other woman currently hold the title.\n\nnull\n\nAdditionally, Khal Moro had two wives; it is unclear which of them bore the title of khaleesi.\n\nAccording to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, \"khaleesi\" is pronounced \"khal-EE-see\". However, professional linguist David J. Peterson, who developed the Dothraki language for the TV series, states that the word's proper pronunciation is \"KHAH-lay-see\".

Unlike the crowns of other kingdoms, which were usually reused by at least a few generations of monarchs, each and every driftwood crown was prepared specially for each individual king by the Drowned Men. Upon death, each crown would be broken up and cast back into the sea or put to sea with the king's remains, and a new one made from fresh driftwood."],"name":"King of the Iron Islands","description":"In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Iron Islands were an independent sovereign kingdom from the Dawn Age, up until they were conquered by Aegon I Targaryen three centuries ago during the War of Conquest.\n\n\"Kingship\" over the Iron Islands actually has an odd history compared with practices on the mainland, particularly because the position is not necessarily hereditary. For much of their history, each island was its own \"kingdom\" with two kings: a \"Rock King\" who ruled the land, and a \"Salt King\" who commanded at sea. The \"King of the Iron Islands\", also known as the \"High King\" or \"Iron King\", was an over-king set above the rest. Moreover, the \"High King of the Iron Islands\" was an elective kingship, not a hereditary one (somewhat similar to early practice in the Holy Roman Empire). Each new High King was elected in an assembly known as a Kingsmoot.\n\nFive thousand years ago, Urron Greyiron killed all of candidates at the Kingsmoot, and established a dynasty that ruled the Iron Islands as hereditary kings for a thousand years. The Greyirons were destroyed four thousand years ago during the Andal Invasion, when they were deposed by House Hoare. Even so, House Hoare apparently summoned a Kingsmoot to confirm their new rule when they overthrew the Greyirons, but the practice was not revived and House Hoare continued to rule as hereditary kings for the next four thousand years, up until their destruction in the Targaryen Conquest. House Greyjoy was subsequently selected to rule over the Iron Islands on behalf of the Targaryens. During the first Greyjoy Rebellion, Balon Greyjoy declared himself king and rebelled against the mainland, his claim to kingship over the rest of the ironborn partially based on the fact that he was already overlord of the islands.\n\nThe kings did not have crowns which were handed down through dynasties. Each new king made a new Driftwood Crown out of actual driftwood, and their styles varied widely (some large and ornate, others small and elegantly simple). At the end of their reigns their crowns were broken up and the pieces cast back into the sea for the Drowned God, and their successor would make a new crown.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Balon Greyjoy makes a second attempt to secede from the mainland and declares independence once again as King of the Iron Islands. However, it is pointed out within the narrative that the matter of Balon's succession is unclear, given the Iron Islands' unusual practices in the past of elective kingship. Even after the Kingsmoots ended, when the kingship became hereditary, the line of succession within the royal family was often very unstable, and decided at the point of a sword. The revived \"Kingdom of the Iron Islands\" has not yet settled upon a new pattern of inheritance law, thus there is some dispute and jockeying for position over who exactly is Balon's designated heir. Following the primogeniture laws of the mainland, Theon would be Balon's heir as his only surviving son. However, under equal primogeniture laws (such as in Dorne), his older sister Asha (Yara in the TV series) could be argued to be the heir. Moreover, other forms of inheritance laws (similar to real-life Anjou) would actually place the king's brothers ahead of his children, thus favoring Balon's brothers Euron and Victarion. Euron has been exiled from the islands, however, and Balon's youngest brother Aeron voluntarily does not consider himself eligible to succeed because he is a priest of the Drowned God. Ultimately, the matter might be decided by a Kingsmoot, in which case the most popular potential heir would succeed. In such a scenario, Theon isn't very popular, and Asha\/Yara would have difficulty succeeding to power as a woman in the misogynistic culture of the ironborn, while Victarion is very well respected as the commander of the Iron Islands' navy. This leads to considerable bickering over who exactly is considered to be Balon's royal heir. In contrast to the kingship, succession over simple lordships in the Iron Islands (such as Balon's lordship of Pyke island), follows the male primogeniture laws of the mainland.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/King_of_the_Iron_Islands"}}

Styr catches up with Tormund in a ravine a month later and the two have a cold meeting. Tormund confesses to Ygritte that he hates Thenns, and tells Styr that he won't answer to him for any recent losses, only to Mance. Tormund also asks Styr how he found them, and why they approached from the south, rather than the north. Styr points to his own Thenn warg and his accompanying owl, and says that his men took a detour to feed on a nearby village, sharing that he finds meat so much better south of the Wall. The Thenns then discard the two rabbits that the other wildlings had on the fire, and produce parts of a human body from a bag, which they put to roast. Reclining before the meat, Styr tells Tormund that he should try \"crow\" before his death.\n\nWhen Lord Commander Jon Snow and Tormund arrive at Hardhome to offer the Free Folk to retreat to Castle Black and settle south of the Wall, a meeting of the clan chieftains is held, where the Thenns are represented by Loboda.

Jon argues Mance Rayder would have supported his suggestion, so Loboda asks what happened to him. When Snow admits he killed him, Loboda prepares to kill him, only to be stopped by Tormund, who reveals it was a mercy kill. Loboda remains stubborn, claiming that all the Free Folk who get on the Crows' boats will be executed, as they have always been enemies and his ancestors would spit on him if he broke bread with a crow.

Addam was one of only four of the so-called dragonseeds to successfully bond with a dragon, Seasmoke.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Addam_Velaryon"}}

Few contested Maegor at first, because unlike Aenys, he effectively hammered the Faith Militant. After Aenys's death, Jaehaerys, his mother Alyssa, and his sister Alysanne were held as hostages on Dragonstone to prevent Prince Aegon, Aenys's eldest son and rightful heir, from trying to take the throne. Jaehaerys's older brother Viserys was also held captive but in King's Landing as the king's squire. Prince Aegon launched his own revolt against Maegor in 43 AC, riding his own father's dragon Quicksilver, but was killed by Maegor riding Balerion at the great Battle Beneath the God's Eye. After the death of Dowager Queen Visenya on Dragonstone in 44 AC, Alyssa, Jaehaerys and Alysanne escaped from Dragonstone. Viserys was killed as retaliation for their escape. With Aegon and Viserys dead, this left Jaehaerys as Aenys's last male heir.","The Nightfort was not simply abandoned during Jaehaerys I's reign, but actually visited by him and Queen Alysanne. The royal couple had made a formal visit to Winterfell in a great flight consisting of six dragons. During the visit to Winterfell Alysanne grew bored, and on a whim flew north to the Wall on her dragon Silverwing (when Samwell Tarly passed through the Nightfort over two hundred years later, his mind boggled that a live dragon once stood in its courtyard). She was followed later by Jaehaerys himself. The Night's Watch had been in a serious decline for several decades, however, because ever since the Targaryen Conquest the Iron Throne had put an end to the constant petty wars which had been going on between the Seven Kingdoms for centuries. While this greatly benefited the prosperity of the new unified realm, it meant that the constant trickle of recruits from the losing sides of those petty wars dried up. Alysanne was deeply impressed with the bravery of the men of the Night's Watch, and convinced her husband to double the size of the lands of the Gift. The boost of support that the New Gift gave the Watch helped stall its decline for several generations (though it was in full decline again two hundred years later when Jon and Sam joined it). At the same time, the royal couple recognized that the Watch could no longer adequately man the Nightfort, and convinced them to abandon it. A new, smaller castle was built east of the Nightfort, named Deep Lake , to replace its guard over that section of the Wall (while the Watch's headquarters were transferred to the more centrally located Castle Black). Deep Lake castle was paid for by Alysanne herself, and constructed by men that Jaehaerys I sent north. Thus the Night's Watch also remembers Jaehaerys and Alysanne with great esteem, as increasingly later monarchs came to practically ignore the Night's Watch.","The practical result of all this is that despite Alysanne giving birth to thirteen children by Jaehaerys, they only had three grandchildren who survived to adulthood and had children of their own: Rhaenys, Viserys I, and Daemon."],"name":"Jaehaerys I Targaryen","description":"Jaehaerys I was the fourth king of the Targaryen dynasty, and reigned two centuries before the War of the Five Kings.

Daenerys decides to enlist his help in reclaiming the Iron Throne. For his loyalty and service, Tyrion is named as Hand of the Queen to Daenerys before they set sail for Westeros with her new army and allies, ready to advise her when they reach her ancestral home of Dragonstone, where he acts as her strategist during her invasion of Westeros.","Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of the realm. He is the younger brother of Jaime and Cersei Lannister. His mother Joanna Lannister died giving birth to him. His father and sister blame Tyrion for the death.","The next morning, Tyrion leads the tribes into battle, but is knocked out by one of his own warriors' mis-swung hammers just as the engagement begins. Recovering after the battle, Tyrion learns from his father that Robb deceived them, delaying their army with a feinting force so the main Stark host can fall on and defeat Jaime's army in battle.","Tyrion turns to books for insight into siege defense tactics, but Bronn warns that the grim realities of a siege cannot be understood from reading. Tyrion affirms the loyalty of Varys and is enigmatic about his plans for the battle, but believes Stannis will attack at the Mud Gate.","In result, Tyrion hesitantly marries Sansa. At the night of their wedding, Tyrion gets drunk and threatens Joffrey with castration after the latter commands him to carry out the bedding ceremony with Sansa. Tywin calms Joffrey and Tyrion takes Sansa to his bedchamber, where he tells her that his lord father has commanded him to consumate the marriage. As Sansa begins to disrobe, Tyrion refuses, insisting that he won't bed her until she wants him to, then he passes out drunk.","In the days following, Tyrion, along with other noblemen and women present in King's Landing, attend the breakfast on the morning of Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell's wedding. He meets Varys before arriving, who informs him of Cersei's spy and Cersei's consequent knowledge of Shae's presence, and warns him that Tywin will know shortly. Varys also warns him that he will not protect Tyrion or Shae against the former's father and sister out of regard for his own safety. At the breakfast, Tyrion observes Cersei's indication of Shae to her father as \"the whore I told you about\". Tywin subsequently requests that she be brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding. Tyrion then presents the groom a gift of a tome detailing the reigns of Daeron, the Young Dragon; Baelor the Blessed; Aegon the Unworthy and Daeron the Good. This is met with surprising approval and gratitude from the King until he is presented with a Valyrian steel sword by his grandfather and proceeds to demonstrate the blade's sharpness by destroying the book with it.","Tyrion generously assumes that this will happen (which it generally doesn't), but then he reminds Daenerys that Meereen has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the Great Masters and the smallfolk, and extends this to Westeros and its Great Houses. He notes that Houses Targaryen and Stark are effectively dead or scattered due to the combined actions of their \"two terrible fathers\". Neither House Lannister nor House Baratheon of Dragonstone will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the Targaryens. Tyrion says that leaves House Tyrell, who originally sided with the Crown in Robert's Rebellion and might be willing to help her due to Cersei's recent schemes against them, but that it still isn't enough. Daenerys stubbornly likens the Great Houses, including her own House Targaryen, to spokes on a wheel: one on top of the others, and on and on, crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy. Tyrion sarcastically warns that others have dreamt of stopping the wheel, but Daenerys clarifies that she isn't planning to stop the wheel, she intends to break it.","In the Great Pyramid, Tyrion wishes to celebrate with Missandei and Grey Worm for the resurgence of Meereen and to honour their queen. Their celebration is cut short when a large fleet of slaver ships lay siege to the city. As the slavers continue to bombard Meereen, Tyrion allows Grey Worm to assume command. Grey Worm proposes that the Unsullied must not go to the beach, preferring to wait until the slavers enter the Great Pyramid. At that moment, they hear movement on the roof. When they go to investigate, they discover that Daenerys has returned on her dragon Drogon.","Back at Dragonstone, Tyrion discusses the aftermath of the battle with Varys. Though confident that Daenerys is not her father, Varys suggests that Tyrion find a way to make her listen to his advice. When Tyrion notices a message in his hand, Varys says that it is for Jon.","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tyrion is in his mid-twenties when the events of the series begin, whereas in the show his age is not mentioned. However, the age gap between him and his siblings is smaller: in the books Tyrion was born when Cersei and Jaime were 10, while in the show, they were 4. This was likely to accommodate the actors: Peter Dinklage is four years older than Lena Headey and one year older than Nikolaj Coster-Waldau."],"name":"Tyrion Lannister","description":"Tyrion recognized from an early age that his mind was his greatest weapon, due to being born a member of House Lannister with the expectation of upholding his family's noble name, yet lacking the physical attributes possessed by his older siblings. Thus, he has committed himself to possessing a sharp intellect in order to help make up for his dwarfism, and he is frequently able to use his superior intellect to get the better of those who initially look down upon him or weasel his way out of tight situations, though he is not above resorting to using his family name and enormous fortune to bolster his position. He has also shown himself to possess a keen mind for strategy, as is evidenced in his research into defending against sieges and successfully conducting the defense of King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion prides himself on his ability to read people as easily as he does books, and he has on many occasions easily gotten the better of not just Joffrey and Cersei but also experienced players such as Littlefinger and Pycelle. \n\nDespite his harsh treatment at the hands of others over the years, Tyrion has managed to develop a thick skin and is able to brush off others' japes about his short stature (except when coming from his father). Tyrion advised Jon Snow how to handle his own bastard status, which reflects Tyrion's own approach to life: take your impediment in stride and wear it like armor, so it cannot be used to hurt you. Being born a dwarf and subject to ridicule for most of his life, Tyrion has admittedly developed a soft spot for his fellow outcasts and has shown them kindness, such as having a saddle designed for the crippled Bran Stark allowing him to ride. Being physically weak, Tyrion is also upset when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly enraged when Janos Slynt carried out an order to kill a defenseless baby girl, Barra (because she was one of Robert's bastards), and as punishment had him exiled to the Wall. Tyrion is also genuinely loyal to those who treat him with love and respect. He also seems to have a level of honor and dignity that the rest of his family seem to lack; events such as the Red Wedding disgusted him, and he considered them to be crimes (though he did admit that there was a certain level of \"cheating\" in war that he is comfortable with, the Red Wedding went beyond that).\n\nTyrion, however, is not without faults. He tends to overindulge in food, drink, and sex in part to self-medicate for the terrible treatment he's suffered most of his life. Tyrion can also act vicious if he feels he's been wronged - such as confining Grand Maester Pycelle to the Black Cells for betraying him or, in his darkest hour, killing Shae for testifying against him during his trial and having an affair with his father, and then going on to kill Tywin himself. Because his father and sister treated him like a social leper, Tyrion craves love and acceptance and is genuinely hurt when this is denied him by others. \n\nHe has complex relationships with other members of his family, most of whom resent him and only thinly veil their contempt for his existence. His older sister Cersei blames him for causing the death of their mother and has (as revealed during a conversation with Oberyn) hated Tyrion since his birth. His father, Tywin, shares Cersei's resentment for Tyrion due to the death of his wife while birthing him, as Joanna Lannister was the only person Tywin ever loved. Although Tywin recognizes and respects Tyrion's intellect, it does not lessen his prejudice towards his youngest son; by the same token Tyrion fears and admires his father, but hates him for his inflexibility and unwillingness to show any love for his children. Tywin also just thinks it is an embarrassment that Tyrion was born with a physical disability, seeing it as a judgement from the gods meant to humiliate him by his son's mere existence.\n\nOnly Tyrion's older brother Jaime maintained a good relationship with Tyrion, admiring him for both his intellect and inability to let his diminished stature drag him down, and he has frequently attempted to come to Tyrion's defense when his other family members treat him maliciously, making Jaime the only member of his immediate family whom Tyrion loves. Tyrion harbors a mutual admiration for Jaime, even naming him as his champion when he demanded a trial by combat while being held prisoner at the Eyrie. However, this cozy relationship ended when Tyrion killed their father.\n\nAfter he killed Shae and his father, Tyrion becomes a broken man: he had lost the will to live. Traumatised by killing the woman he loved and losing his lordship, influence and fabulous wealth, he becomes more cynical and pessimistic and was content to just drink himself to death instead of helping Varys to aid Daenerys Targaryen in getting the Iron Throne. Tyrion becomes convinced in the futility of everything, gaining a negative and rather fatalistic outlook on the past and the future, to the point of suicidal, as well gains a lower view for matters he dealt with high esteem and importance beforehand in the past, such as the Great Houses or the bid for the Iron Throne. Even when meeting Daenerys face to face, Tyrion explained that he was still content to die. However, whilst helping with the chaos in Meereen, and keeping Daenerys from becoming like her father in her ruthlessness, he regains his will to live. He also finally finds something to believe in, as he believes in Daenerys. His sense of humor is more muted and cynical than before, however; this may be the result of his no longer being able to rely on his family title for protection and influence, and having to earn his merits with Daenerys on his brains alone.  \n\nAlthough Tyrion's skills with political maneuvering, administration, and diplomacy are extremely impressive, his record as a military strategist and tactician are more mixed. In this respect he is similar to his father, although unlike Tywin, Tyrion's lack of skill on the battlefield has more to do with his unwillingness to inflict heavy loss of life on either side. He achieved a successful ambush at the Battle of the Blackwater with his wildfire trap and led his troops personally on a sortie, but this alone was still not enough to win the battle without help from Tywin and the Tyrells; indeed, the massive casualties resulting from the wildfire shook him and (presumably) made him reluctant to use such a devastating weapon again. This, in turn, made him somewhat overly cautious in his strategy to help Daenerys win against Cersei. As a result, most of his battle plans, with the exception of capturing Casterly Rock, failed, leading Daenerys to lose her patience with his strategy and take matters into her own hands. Nonetheless, Tyrion played a valuable role in developing and solidifying the alliance between Daenerys and Jon Snow, the King in the North.  \n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tyrion_Lannister"}}

She tasks Brienne with escorting him to King's Landing to exchange him for her captive daughters.","While sitting at the dinner table with Brienne and Roose Bolton, Jaime relentlessly tries to cut his meat with one hand. Roose tells Jaime that wars cost money and that many people would pay a great deal of money for him. After discussing how busy Tywin is, Jaime informs Roose that his father would make time for him. Roose tells Jaime, that when he is well enough to travel, he will allow him to return to King's Landing on the condition that he will tell Tywin the truth, that he had nothing to do with his maiming.","Jaime is offered a sword by his father Tywin which is made of Valyrian steel from the recently reforged Ice, the Starks' ancestral sword. He comments that House Lannister has always wanted its own Valyrian blade and Tywin answers that they now have two. He then reveals to Jaime his plan to have him removed from the Kingsguard so that he can return to Casterly Rock and rule as Lord in his stead. However, Jaime tells him that he has no plans of resigning and that he will remain in King's Landing to protect the King. He also rejects that this is about his honor, as he believes that his honor is too far gone so he might as well do what he wants rather than what is expected of him. Tywin agrees to let him do so, but tells him that he no longer considers him a Lannister. Despite this, Tywin allows Jaime to keep the sword, saying that a 'one-armed man with no family needs all the help he can get'.","Later, Jaime is escorted into the main apartments of the Water Gardens by Areo Hotah, to be received by Prince Doran Martell in his solar, along with Ellaria Sand, Doran's son Trystane Martell, and Jaime's \"niece\" Myrcella Baratheon. Doran asks Jaime why he has snuck into Dorne to abduct Myrcella back to King's Landing.","After Brienne fails to persuade the Blackfish, Jaime visits Edmure to offer him a deal, trying to tempt him with seeing his son and sending him, his son and his wife Roslin Frey to Casterly Rock. Edmure ridicules Jaime and he responds by warning him that people can do anything for love, threatening that he will kill every Tully in order to be able to return to King's Landing and be with Cersei again. With his family's life credibly threatened, Edmure agrees to cooperate.","At that moment, they hear a roar not heard on the battlefields of Westeros in over a century and a half, and look above the Dothraki horde to see a huge adult dragon heading straight for their lines - Drogon, ridden by Daenerys Targaryen herself. Drogon outpaces the Dothraki, and at Daenerys's command \"Dracarys!\", he blasts a torrent of fire through the Lannister ranks in a straight line from front to back, punching a hole in their formation. The highly mobile Dothraki light cavalry immediately sweep through it and wheel around to catch those parts of the Lannister lines in an envelopment.","After Jaime is captured in the Battle of the Whispering Wood, he is held at Riverrun, not taken along with Robb's army, though Robb only leaves Riverrun some time later so he can consolidate his forces. No scenes between Jaime and Robb are depicted in the books (as neither is a POV character at this point), though it is entirely plausible that the scene with Robb in Jaime's cell in the Season 2 premiere could have happened in the books, just \"off screen\", as Robb doesn't immediately leave Riverrun. At first, Jaime is held in comfortable imprisonment in a tower of Riverrun, but after a failed escape attempt, in which he manages to kill two guards and seriously injure a third before being subdued, he is chained up in the dungeon.","Following his maiming, Jaime is determined to regain his fighting skills, practicing diligently, but his progress is very slow. He learns to rely on his brain rather than his sword. He is more cautious and less rash than before."],"name":"Jaime Lannister","description":"At first glance, outsiders perceive Jaime to be arrogant, disdainful, and sarcastic. To a large extent he is arrogant about his own abilities, but not without cause. Even his enemies admit that he is arguably the greatest living swordsman in Westeros with few able to match him. Jaime's loss of his sword-hand did much to humble him, given that in many ways he was that hand and how much his self-identity depended on his skills with a sword. Jaime does not mock others over minor insults the way Cersei does, and he can muster up polite behavior, but he is usually very blunt. Much like his brother Tyrion, he typically just says what he is thinking, and has no reservations about mocking those he perceives as incompetent. Despite this, there were men that Jaime admired (like Ser Barristan Selmy, for whom he squired) and, underneath this cold and sarcastic attitude, Jaime is a very complicated man.\n\nTywin Lannister has raised Jaime and Cersei with the principle of ruthlessness as a virtue. Yet even though Jaime Lannister often behaves unapologetically amoral, in his own warped way, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family (Tywin and his three children) aside from Tyrion who shows any hint of honor or principles, whilst Tywin claims to see family as his highest priority but simultaneously is willing to have Tyrion, whom he views as an incalculable disgrace, killed, and Cersei herself ironically sees no immorality whatsoever in anything she does. This is largely based on his arrogance and pride at being a member of the Kingsguard. Jaime became extremely disillusioned with ideals of honor and loyalty when he saw firsthand the atrocities committed by the Mad King, how other \"honorable\" members of the Kingsguard stood by and did nothing while King Aerys had people burned alive for imagined insults, because they felt bound by vows of faith and fealty - in this sense, Jaime is surprisingly similar to Sandor Clegane, since they both have powerful disillusionments about honor and nobility, yet they both frequently avoid unnecessary violence.\n\nA key difference between Cersei and Jaime is that Cersei honestly believes, in her skewed view of the world, that she is \"good\", Joffrey is a great king, and all of her enemies are \"evil\" people trying to destroy her and her children. In contrast, Jaime does not maintain any pretense of being a \"good\" or honorable man, as he has become apathetic to such concerns - this was influenced by him being hated and loathed by everyone because he killed a man who had infamously terrorized the Seven Kingdoms, opening his eyes to how people perceive goodness and honor. However, he still has some respect for the rules of engagement, as he refused to kill Ned Stark when their duel ended abruptly, since Ned was incapacitated by an opportunistic guard rather than Jaime himself.\n\nMoreover, Jaime isn't a very politically ambitious man, much to Cersei's annoyance, and often turns down her frequent urgings that he should try to become Hand of the King, stating that the days are too long and their lives are too short. Political maneuvering is not his way, and he sees himself foremost as a soldier who when confronted with a problem takes out his sword and cuts its head off. Up until the day his hand was cut off, he had immersed himself in combat so much that it is his sole value, and when he does lose his hand, his sword hand, he loses the will to live because, thus far, he has only ever had to decapitate a problem so as not to face it again, but now he cannot wield a sword the same way ever again - he laments that he was that hand. Brienne of Tarth is quick to tirade to him about him having a small taste of a world where people have their good things ripped from their possession, and after that one small taste he gives up - she mistakes him for a coward at this point. Indeed, Jaime's lack of political thinking leads to him heatedly suggesting that either he or someone else execute the High Sparrow and his followers for manipulating Tommen - at the time, he did not quite see the long term ramifications of such an act because he was angry at the possibility of losing his only surviving child.\n\nAfter losing his hand and confessing the real reason he killed Aerys to Brienne of Tarth, Jaime begins to redevelop a sense of personal honor once again as he reevaluates his past and future. In no small part to Brienne's influence, Jaime begins to his his father for who he really is and begins to wonder if there are ideals worth fighting for. To this end, he outfits Brienne with new armor and even gifts her the Valyrian steel sword reforged from Ice so that Brienne can fulfill her oath to Catelyn Stark. Jaime himself is more mindful of the promises he makes, and eventually tries offering his solemn oath in certain circumstances, treated with understandable skepticism by the likes of Edmure Tully. Jaime's new outlook develops to the point where he is disgusted with Cersei for stabbing Daenerys's faction in the back, and announces his intention to keep his own promises (although the undead horror bearing down on the Seven Kingdoms clearly has something to do with it).\n\nJaime is the only member of Tyrion's immediate family who ever treated him with respect or kindness. In fact, he admires Tyrion's intellect and his ability to tell off those who insult him. Jaime never approved of Tywin and Cersei's long history of abuse towards Tyrion, and has always treated him like a brother. Indeed, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family who has a reasonably good relationship with all of the others. Among the three siblings, Cersei and Tyrion can't stand each other, but they both like Jaime (both Cersei and Tyrion have acknowledged the only reason they haven't gone out of their way to seriously harm or kill each other is because Jaime would never forgive them if they did). However, in recent times, Jaime's good relationship with Tyrion seems to have died with their father, and Jaime said he would kill Tyrion the next time they meet (though it is unclear if he really meant it). His relationship with Cersei has also deteriorated in the aftermath of Tywin's death since it was Jaime who set Tyrion free and inadvertently allowed him to kill their father.\n\nTywin is a stern man feared and resented by all of his children, ignoring Cersei for her gender and scorning Tyrion for both his stature and killing his wife in childbirth. However, Jaime is on reasonably good terms with Tywin - not so much that he is \"proud\" of Jaime so much as he has the \"least shame\" for him compared to his brother and sister. Even so, Tywin is upset that Jaime willingly joined the Kingsguard, as while it is considered the highest honor for a knight, its members give up the rights to marry or inherit lands, meaning that Jaime cannot be Tywin's heir. Jaime wasn't in a position to act as a father to his biological children with Cersei, though he is generally supportive of Tommen and Myrcella. However, in sharp contrast with Cersei, Jaime isn't particularly fond of Joffrey, nor will he defend his actions the way Cersei does. He shows obvious joy when Myrcella reveals her knowledge that Jaime is her father and is happy about it, and embraces her, since this is the first time he has ever been able to show his feelings as a father to his children. He is equally saddened when Myrcella dies in his arms moments later.\n\nJaime's attitude towards violence is also complex: he threw Bran Stark out a tower window to kill him, but later saved Brienne twice (from being raped, then fed to a bear) from Locke's soldiers. The difference seems to be that after witnessing the depravations of the Mad King, needless violence and brutality deeply offend Jaime, though if he decides that violence and murder are absolutely necessary he will ruthlessly carry it out himself. He threw Bran out of a window because had the boy reported that he saw the incest between Jaime and his sister, Cersei, the woman he loved, then all of their children would be executed, so he felt he had no choice. Jaime killed his defenseless cousin Alton Lannister in order to orchestrate an escape from Robb Stark's camp, but he deeply regretted it afterwards, subtly hinting at it to Tyrion and then outright confessing to the High Sparrow about it, showing that he has a greater conscience than he is given credit for. This sets him apart from Cersei, who destroyed the Sept of Baelor and everyone inside and around it, and proved unapologetic about what she had done. Jaime also was capable of reproach for the mistakes he made and their consequences, unlike Cersei: he felt guilt for freeing Tyrion because it led to the death of his father, whereas Cersei is blind to her own mistakes, which led to the deaths of her children. The upshot of this is that Jaime has no delusions about his own conscience.\n\nOverall, Jaime is a surprisingly skilled battle commander. While he is far less intellectual than Tyrion, he inherited at least some of Tywin's ruthless intelligence, as demonstrated by his decisive handling of the siege of Riverrun; on arriving, he quickly corrected most of the inadequacies that the Freys had created, then ended the entire siege almost bloodlessly by coercing Edmure to enter Riverrun and (as head of House Tully) force his men to surrender. Previously, Jaime had won the Battle of Golden Tooth against the River Lords under Hoster Tully, which forced them back and allowed him to besiege Riverrun. Jaime also learns from his mistakes; remembering how Robb Stark tricked him by leaving a small decoy force to be overwhelmed while the rest of the army moved to attack more important targets, Jaime allowed the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock (after having emptied its larders) while taking most of the Lannisters' forces south to storm Highgarden. Not only is Jaime a prodigal leader, but he has a good amount of common sense, as evidenced by his decision to ride north to combat the threat that the White Walkers posed to Westeros, and his utter incredulity at Cersei's refusal to contribute.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jaime_Lannister"}}

Although noble-born bastards are often ignored by their parents, Oberyn has acknowledged and looked after all his daughters and has loving relationships with each of them. They are all loyal members of House Martell, and are treated as such by their uncle Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Their collective nickname comes from the bastard surname used for noble bastards in Dorne and the nickname of their father: the \"Red Viper.\" Oberyn trained the oldest three \u2014Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene\u2014 extensively in combat."],"name":"Sand Snakes","description":"null\n\nThe Sand Snakes are all Oberyn's daughters and raised in Dornish culture, but they have a variety of personalities that play off each other. As sisters, they might bicker on a course of action from time to time, but when faced with an external threat they will instantly band together to overcome it.\n\nObara, the eldest, inherited her father's martial prowess. Unlike the other Sand Snakes she is not the daughter of a noblewoman but of a commoner that caught Oberyn's eye. When she was a little girl Oberyn came to bring her to court, and made her choose between him or her mother; she chose to go with him, knowing she would never see her mother again (who later died). While the Dornish are often hot-blooded and passionately display their emotions, Obara is very taciturn, trained not to outwardly show her emotions. However, this does not mean that she is the most rational member of the group: she is in fact one of the more irrational of the sisters, ruled by her emotions. The distinction is that she will not shout or make threats if someone angers her - she will simply kill them unexpectedly, with little heed to the long term consequences. She is exceptionally skilled at combat with a traditional Dornish spear, having been trained extensively by her father.\n\nNymeria, the second eldest, is the daughter of an eastern noblewoman. She is the most rational and calculating of the Sand Snakes, having inherited Oberyn's cunning, evidenced by her choice of weapon: a 12 foot bull whip. In the right hands, a whip can be used for unpredictable attacks to disarm or trip up a larger opponent carrying heavier weapons, but it requires a large amount of strategy and planning during the fight in order to use effectively. In situations in which the other sisters would charge ahead, Nymeria will hold back and try to assess the situation, to calculate if it would be more opportune to wait to strike at a later time (in this she is actually somewhat like her uncle, Prince Doran Martell). Nymeria is Obara's closest confidant: she will do nothing without Obara's approval. At the same time, Nymeria is the only person (besides Oberyn) that can say \"no\" to Obara: to outsiders it might seem like they might be bickering, but Nymeria is the only person that Obara will even bother to heed the advice of, though she might still disagree. With anyone else, Obara doesn't even pause to listen, and simply charges ahead to do what she wanted.\n\nTyene is the youngest of the three (the other five are younger and not traveling with them). As the youngest, she is the most impetuous, trying to prove herself to the others, and the most overtly hot-tempered. In a situation where Nymeria would pause to assess her enemy before making a precision strike, and Obara would silently charge right in and attack with cold force, Tyene will passionately shout and threaten her enemy as she attacks them head-on. This prowess is exemplified in her choice of hand weapons: short daggers for quick attacks, which she can draw and strike with before her sisters can restrain her. She also greatly enjoys using poison against her enemies - most often using poisons to coat the blades of her daggers, as Oberyn was known to poison the blades of his spears.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Sand Snakes are infamous throughout Dorne. Their names, in order of age, are Obara, Nymeria, Tyene, Sarella, Elia, Obella, Dorea, and Loreza. Obara was born of a prostitute from Oldtown; Nymeria of a noblewoman from Volantis; Tyene of a septa; Sarella of a trader from the Summer Isles; the rest of Ellaria Sand. Despite inheriting widely different appearances from their birthmothers, they are all said to have their father's eyes. Being Dornish bastards, they all have the surname \"Sand\" and are associate members of their father's House.\n\nThe oldest four are close friends and confidants of Prince Doran Martell's daughter and heiress, Princess Arianne.\n\nEach of the eldest four Sand Snakes inherited or took after one of their father's famous traits: Obara has her father's martial prowess; Nymeria inherited Oberyn's good looks, sex drive, and cunning; Tyene has her father's skill with poisons; Sarella inherited her father's keen intellect.\n\nThe Sand Snakes' choice of weapons are different than in the TV show: Obara uses both a spear and a whip; Nymeria - daggers; Tyene is not mentioned to have any martial skills.\n\nThe younger four Sand Snakes do not appear prominently in the first five novels, due to their ages: Elia Sand, the eldest, is fourteen years old near the end of the fifth novel, and Loreza (the youngest) is only around six years old. Elia, however, is old enough to share her half-sisters' rapport with Princess Arianne, and is just starting to be old enough to take part in the activities of her elders by the beginning of the sixth novel. Sarella has not make any appearances in the novels yet either; she is only mentioned to be at unknown location outside of Dorne.\n\n\"Tyene Sand\" in the TV series is basically a combination of book-Tyene Sand and book-Elia Sand into one character. It's not clear if this means that Ellaria is also Sarella's mother in the series or if she still has a different parentage.\n\nDoran Martell acts very cautiously when any of his nieces are present. He is aware how dangerous they are, and that their kinship will not stop them from harming him (after he caressed Tyene's head, Maester Caleotte examined his palm very carefully and thoroughly for any scratches or a particular smell to see if she poisoned him). Areo Hotah watches them closely in such occasions, ready to take action whenever they make a potentially harmful move.\n\nOn the second novel, Tyrion said \"The Martells have every cause to hate us. Nonetheless, I expect them to agree. Prince Doran's grievance against House Lannister goes back only a generation, but the Dornishmen have warred against Storm's End and Highgarden for a thousand years\". Tyrion was wrong at least in respect of the Sand Snakes, whose hatred is mainly aimed at the Lannisters, and barely speak about the Tyrells. The reason is perhaps that specific and recent atrocities - let alone exceptionally savage ones, as the murder of Elia and her children - are burnt in memory much more vividly than general hostilities. Morever, Oberyn's death has greatly increased the hatred the Sand Snakes feel toward the Lannisters, thus belittling any grudge (if at all) that they have against the Tyrells.\n\nIn the beginning of A Feast of Crows, the three eldest Sand Snakes come up with various plans to avenge their father, none involves harming Myrcella:\n\nnull\n\nPrince Doran rejects the above plans, and takes steps to prevent all his nieces from stirring up troubles, by arresting the three elder daughters and confining the four youngest and their mother to the Water Gardens; Sarella he leaves alone, as she is not in Dorne at the time. However, his daughter Arianne attempts to accomplish Tyene's plan, which nearly results in Myrcella's death: one of Arianne's escorts, Ser Gerold \"Darkstar\" Dayne, injures her severely and escapes. Myrcella survives but is terribly disfigured. Arianne is imprisoned, like her seven cousins.\n\nAs much as the Sand Snakes hate the Lannisters and wish to exact revenge, they (and Ellaria Sand) never had any personal grudge against Myrcella, and never intended to harm her. They are not responsible at all to the near-fatal attempt on her life, although it can serve their purpose well, as Obara commented.\n\nIn the fifth novel, after Ser Balon Swann arrives in Dorne to retrieve Myrcella (and to play his part in Cersei's scheme to assassinate Trystane), Doran orders the release of his daughter and nieces, and gives them tasks: Obara will lead Ser Balon in the chase after Darkstar, while Nymeria and Tyene accompany Myrcella to King's Landing; Nymeria will take her father's seat on the Small Council, while Tyene, disguised as septa, will befriend the new High Septon. All three of the Sand Snakes swear that they will serve their uncle when he reveals that he has been conspiring for years to gain total revenge on the Lannisters by working to restore House Targaryen.\n\nAs for the youngest Sand Snakes: according to Arianne's sample chapters of the sixth novel, Elia accompanies Arianne on a mission to meet potential allies; Loreza and her mother travel to her grandfather's seat at Hellholt; Obella is dispatched to Sunspear to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan Manfrey Martell; Dorea remained at the Water Gardens. \n\nIn sharp contrast to the show, as much as the Sand Snakes are angry at their uncle for lack of action against the Lannisters, none of them has ever harmed him or Trystane; even if they had such intentions, Areo Hotah would have never acted so carelessly as he did in the show: he always watches the Sand Snakes very carefully when they are around his prince (perhaps even more closely than he watches other people), knowing how deadly they are, ready to react to any potentially harmful move on their behalf. It's quite the contrary, after Doran tells them about a plot of Cersei to kill Trystane in an ambush, with the plan to get her daughter back and to blame Tyrion for this, all the Sand Snakes are shocked; Obara is outraged and wants retaliation against Ser Balon and his party who are part of this scheme.\n\nThough in the novels the Sand Snakes are fierce warriors, they adhere to a strong code of honor and absolutely refuse to harm innocent people, unlike in the television series where they are depicted as villainous mercenaries similar to the likes of Ramsay Bolton: Obara is presented as almost machine-like in nature, ready to commit cold-blooded murder solely for her own amusement; Nymeria appears indifferent towards the taboo of kinslaying but has a very competitive personality; and Tyene possesses a particularly sadistic streak, greatly enjoying poisoning her enemies and watching the effects kill her opponents slowly. While they claim to fight for Dorne, it is heavily implied that the Sand Snakes have no true alliance to anyone but themselves, and appear prepared to kill anyone who might stand in the way of their goals, even their own people or family members.\n\nBy the point the books reached, the prominent three and the youngest four Sand Snakes are alive; Sarella's status is unknown.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sand_Snakes"}}

He is the only son of Prince Doran Martell, Lord of Sunspear and Prince of Dorne. Like his father Doran, Trystane lacks (for the most part) the hotheadedness typical of Dornishmen, as evidenced by his showing mercy to Bronn for attacking him.\n\nTrystane is proposed as a potential marriage candidate for Princess Myrcella Baratheon by her uncle, Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister. The alliance with the Prince of Dorne is accepted and Myrcella is sent to Dorne as a ward of House Martell.\n\nTrystane is briefly seen walking and flirting with his betrothed Myrcella Baratheon in the Water Gardens during the argument between Ellaria Sand and Prince Doran Martell.\n\nWhen Jaime Lannister and Bronn enter the Water Gardens, Trystane is again taking a walk with Myrcella, with Trystane suggesting they should ask Doran to have them married the next day. Myrcella asks if he only wants to marry her because they are both from Great Houses, but Trystane cuts her off with a passionate kiss. Doran, observing the happy couple, muses to Areo Hotah that they don't realize how much danger they are in and that they must be protected.\n\nWhile kissing Myrcella, Trystane encounters Bronn and Jaime in the Gardens. Although he introduces himself courteously enough, he is clearly suspicious, having heard no news of Jaime's visit to Dorne; his suspicions are aroused further when he sees bloodstains on the stolen robes Jaime and Bronn are wearing. Although Bronn cautions him not to do something stupid, Trystane reaches for his sword, forcing Bronn to knock him out, to Myrcella's distress. Jaime then attempts to take Myrcella out of the palace, but he and Bronn are then attacked by Trystane's cousins, the Sand Snakes. The skirmish ends when all five of the intruders are arrested by Areo Hotah and his guards.\n\nDoran invites Trystane, Myrcella, Ellaria and Jaime to drinking and eat with him. There, he promises Jaime that he does not want a war with the Lannisters and that he will send Myrcella back to King's Landing. However, Trystane and Myrcella's betrothal is to stand, which means Trystane will accompany his betrothed to the capital. He will also take up Oberyn's vacant seat on the Small Council, to further cement the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne. Jaime accepts these terms.\n\nJaime then brings up the matter of Bronn, who is still imprisoned as a result of his aggression on the prince. Doran defers to Trystane to decide, as he must learn how to punish lawbreakers if he must one day rule. Trystane agrees to let Bronn go on one condition: he will receive the same thing that he inflicted upon him. This meets with his father's approval and Bronn is brought before them and Areo elbows him hard across the face. Trystane later accompanies Jaime, Myrcella and Bronn to the harbor of Sunspear, where he remains silent, as the others say farewell to Prince Doran and Ellaria. However, Trystane's life is put in danger when Ellaria and the Sand Snakes secretly poison Myrcella. \n\nTo ensure Trystane's safety and avoid a conflict with Dorne, Jaime leaves him on board the ship once they reach King's Landing. As Trystane paints the eye stones for Myrcella's funeral, he is approached by Obara and Nymeria, having stowed away on the ship and sent to kill him by Ellaria, who has herself murdered Doran back in Dorne. Trystane attempts to reason with his cousins that they are family, but they merely laugh it off. He is given a choice to fight Obara or Nymeria. Though he draws his sword and prepares to fight Nymeria, as she is armed with only a whip, he is stabbed through the back of the head by Obara and killed instantly, much to Nymeria's chagrin.\n\nA small justice is enacted for Trystane when Obara and Nymeria are slain by Euron Greyjoy.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Trystane_Martell"}}

In the distance, a group of thirteen black-garbed White Walkers are revealed to be viewing the proceedings from afar. One of them breaks from the middle of their number and approaches the altar, stopping to regard the human child for a moment before gently gathering him in its arms. The baby immediately calms, staring into the face of the Night King, who has a crown of horns jutting from his head. He places his index finger upon the baby's cheek, causing the child's eyes to turn icy blue and its skin to grow pale: most likely the fate of Craster's other sons.\n\nThe Night King appears again when Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane are coordinating the evacuation of Hardhome. He appears to be leading the attack, or is at least observing it with some other White Walkers, and watches from one of the cliffs above the town as Jon slays one of his lieutenants with Longclaw. The Night King looks on this turn of events with mild interest, as he didn't think anybody would put up any sort of meaningful resistance. As Jon, Tormund and the remaining defenders leave on the boat, the Night King appears on the dock and locks eyes with Jon. With a mere raise of his arms, the Night King raises the entirety of Hardhome's erstwhile defenders as wights, and keeps his gaze upon Jon as the boat slips away.\n\nThe Night King appears in one of Bran Stark's visions, where he witnesses him as a human being transformed into a White Walker by the Children of the Forest, notably among them Leaf. She explains after his vision that they had to do it because they were at war with the First Men.\n\nLater, Bran makes the risky decision to experience a vision on his own, and finds himself looking at an army of wights and the Night King and other White Walkers at the back. Bran walks closer and is shocked to see that the Night King notices his presence. Bran wakes up screaming after the Night King suddenly appears right next to him and grabs his arm.\n\nThe Three-Eyed Raven says that the Night King touched him, which Bran confirms when a blue hand-mark is seen on his forearm. The Three-Eyed Raven says because of that mark, the Night King now knows exactly where they are, and the cave cannot protect them any more.\n\nThe Night King and his army quickly travel to the cave, preceded by their aura of cold, a signal to the Children of the Forest and Meera Reed. The Children of the Forest prepare their scarce defenses outside of the cave, but are quickly overrun and they are forced to retreat back to the tunnels. The Night King sends his army of wights to attack the tunnels, and they kill most of the Children and Summer, though Bran, Meera Reed and Hodor manage to escape the cavern through a back tunnel. One of the other White Walkers is killed by a dragonglass-tipped spear thrown by Meera. The Night King enters the cavern, and glares at the warging Three-Eyed Raven before he kills him.\n\nThe Night King then sends the rest of his wights to kill Leaf, and eventually, Hodor, who attempts to stop the wights from going further by sacrificing himself to hold the door.\n\nWhile Meera drags Bran through the snow, Bran sees visions of the Night King converting Craster's last son into a White Walker, leading a massive attack on Hardhome, and branding him with his mark.\n\nIn the aftermath of his victory at Winterfell and the confirmation from the Citadel that winter has come through white ravens, Jon Snow tells the gathered lords of the North and the Vale who wish to return home following Ramsay Bolton's defeat to prepare for winter. He warns that the war is not over after Cley Cerwyn suggests it is with the defeat of House Bolton, alluding to the Night King as their true enemy, warning that the Night King won't wait out the winter storms, because he is the one who brings the storm.\n\nThe Night King is shown leading his army of Wights and White Walkers south, departing the Lands of Always Winter and heading towards the Wall at last.\n\nSansa Stark and Jon Snow later discuss who the more dangerous enemy is, Cersei Lannister or the Night King, as well as the fact that the Wall still separates humanity from the White Walkers.\n\nDespite her obsession with defeating Cersei Lannister, who sits the Iron Throne, Daenerys Targaryen, who has begun her invasion of Westeros, is told by Jon Snow, who has traveled to Dragonstone, that she will only be ruling a wasteland if the Night King attacks, as he is the true enemy.\n\nJon takes Daenerys down into the caves on Dragonstone after she agrees to allow he and his people to mine the dragonglass beneath Dragonstone. However, Jon has something much more important in mind: showing her the ancient carvings by the Children of the Forest on the rocks, which depict the Children of the Forest and the First Men fighting the White Walkers together. One of these carvings strongly resembles the Night King leading the White Walkers.\n\nWhen Bran Stark wargs into a flock of ravens, he flies them beyond the Wall to spy on the army of the dead. He finds the Night King himself leading them, flanked by some of his lieutenants. When the Night King looks up, the ravens disperse, and Bran is pulled out of the warging. He urges Maester Wolkan to send ravens across Westeros informing the high lords that the Night King is on the move to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.\n\nThe Night King is present when the wights battle Jon Snow at the Wight Hunt, who traveled beyond the Wall with a band of warriors to attempt to capture a wight to use as proof for the gathered high lords of Westeros. When Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons come and attempt to rescue Jon and his group, the Night King is given an ice spear by a lieutenant of his and launches it towards Viserion, piercing the young dragon straight through the neck.\n\nViserion crashes down to the frozen lake, sinking beneath the icy waters. He keeps his gaze on the enraged Jon, who appears on the verge of calling him down to fight directly, but his lieutenant hands him another spear. The Night King throws it at Drogon, but the dragon takes flight and dodges in time.\n\nThe Night King later has his wights heave Viserion's corpse out of the water. Once that is accomplished, the Night King advances towards Viserion's corpse and places a hand on his snout, kneeling to the ground. Moments later, the corpse of Viserion is reanimated as its eyes open, now a depthless, icy blue.\n\nThe mounted White Walkers lead the gathered army of the dead out of the Haunted Forest to the Wall at last. Riding the reanimated Viserion, the Night King breaches the Wall, burning it away where Eastwatch stands, destroying the castle and allowing the White Walkers and their wight army to invade Westeros once more while the Night King flies overhead towards the North.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Night_King"}}

Ros' appearance in future books is now questionable following her death in Season 3."],"name":"Ros","description":"Ros is a prostitute in the brothel in Winterfell's outlying town. She has drawn the attention of the young nobles of Winterfell including Theon Greyjoy and Jon Snow. Theon is a regular customer while Jon is not. Jon once paid Ros for her time but did not have sex with her because of a pang of conscience over the possibility of fathering a bastard when he has suffered the life of being a bastard himself.\n\nRos says that she grew up in the town outside the walls of Winterfell, and remembers the day Sansa Stark was born and all the bells of the castle were rung in celebration. Uncommon for most prostitutes, Ros is literate.\n\nRos is shown entertaining Tyrion Lannister shortly after his arrival at Winterfell. She informs Tyrion that the whorehouse was especially alerted to his imminent arrival, though by whom is not revealed.\n\nWhen Tyrion is returning from the Wall, he stops at Winterfell. Believing the Lannisters are responsible for Bran's fall, Robb denies him Winterfell's hospitality. When Tyrion is leaving to go stay in the brothel, Theon Greyjoy recommends Ros to Tyrion, unaware that Tyrion is already acquainted with her. Tyrion promises \"not to wear her out\". At Castle Black, Jon Snow and his friend Samwell Tarly talk about having never been with a woman. Jon says that he once had the opportunity to have sex with Ros. He describes her to Sam with red hair and indescribably perfect breasts. Jon ultimately declined to have sex with Ros fearing if he fathered bastard children of his own, as a bastard himself he would have nothing to offer them.\n\nTheon sneaks Ros into his chambers, where they both undress and have sex. He notices that she is wearing a Lannister lion pendant and she tells him that it was a gift from Tyrion. He becomes angry when she insinuates that Tyrion is a superior lover and that his family's honor is suspect due to the failed Greyjoy Rebellion. When he refuses to pay for the encounter, Ros suggests that he gets a wife instead, infuriating Theon further.\n\nTheon is surprised to see Ros sitting in the back of a turnip cart. She tells him she has decided to leave Winter town to seek out employment in King's Landing, and is planning to board a boat out of White Harbor.\n\nHe unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay, but she points out that, with war coming, all the men will be marching away and there is nothing for her here, while sarcastically asking Theon if he would be willing to marry her and make her Lady of the Iron Islands if she stayed. Though Theon denies it, his face implies that he has grown to love her. Theon throws her a coin, and she laughs and lifts up her skirt one last time. Theon reluctantly says he'll miss her, and she agrees that he will.\n\nArriving in King's Landing, Ros finds employment at a brothel owned by Littlefinger. He tutors her and another prostitute, Armeca, in the art of seduction. Ros learns that Littlefinger is infatuated with a woman who was betrothed to a man who injured him in a duel, but she later married the man's brother. However, it does not appear that she recognizes the woman in the story as Lady Catelyn Stark.\n\nRos's services are employed by Grand Maester Pycelle in King's Landing. As she gathers her clothes to leave, Pycelle begins to tell her about all the kings he has served, eventually his ramblings fade and she becomes impatient, questioning him about the original point of his speech. She leaves, frustrated.\n\nRos watches two new prostitutes in Petyr Baelish's brothel practicing their work. She repeats Petyr\u2019s advice to ease into the act slowly and with passion. She tells the new employees to wash and dress for work that night before walking away. She is followed by Daisy, who she instructs in the merits of their upmarket brothel. She greets Lord Orson who is passing with a young man as she tells Daisy that they cater to a higher class of customer than she was used to in Haystack Hall. Daisy watches Armeca leading a client away. Ros notes that Armeca pretends not to speak the Common tongue in order to seem exotic and reveals that she actually grew up in Flea Bottom. Daisy says that Armeca is beautiful, but Ros is dismissive of her colleague.\n\nLord Commander Janos Slynt enters with several of his men. Ros greets him with familiarity. More goldcloaks enter with a bloodied prisoner and Janos snaps his fingers at his men who begin to search the brothel. Ros reminds him that Petyr is the establishment\u2019s owner and Janos cites orders.\n\nRos wonders who the orders came from and Janos tells her only that they are from someone who doesn\u2019t care what Petyr thinks. Mhaegen is dragged into the room, holding her baby Barra (one of Robert\u2019s bastards). Janos looks at his prisoner who nods recognition. Janos then signals one of his men who takes the baby from the sobbing Mhaegen, draws his knife and then hesitates. Janos tells his man to kill the baby and then does it himself when his subordinate cannot, horrifying both Ros and Mhaegen.\n\nRos is still visibly upset about the death of Barra. She is so distraught that she falls apart in front of a client. Lord Petyr Baelish comes into her room and she confides in him. However, Baelish compares her to a beautiful girl he purchased from a Lyseni pleasure house for an exorbitant price. The girl was so sad Baelish gained no money from her and he sold her to a Lord who wanted to \"transform\" her, a man who derived pleasure from things most men would find unthinkable. After this lesson, when he asks Ros if one day off will make her smile again Ros smiles and assures him it will.\n\nTyrion Lannister, acting on a suggestion from his enforcer Bronn, hires Ros and Daisy as a late nameday present for his nephew King Joffrey Baratheon. Tyrion hopes this will give the sadistic Joffrey an opportunity to release his frustrations away from Sansa. They wait for him in his chamber. When he arrives Ros wishes him a happy nameday and then reaches for his crotch. He flinches and then instructs Ros to touch Daisy. He asks if Ros can hit Daisy and she spanks her gently. Joffrey asks if Tyrion sent them and Ros says that Tyrion chose them himself. Joffrey takes off his belt and gives it to Ros to use. He forces Ros to hit Daisy hard enough to make her scream.\n\nHe hands Ros a stag\u2019s head sceptre and she protests that too much pain will spoil the pleasure. He loads his crossbow as Ros warns him that his uncle might find out. He tells Ros that he wants Tyrion to find out and orders her to take Daisy to Tyrion\u2019s chambers to show him what has happened or she will also be beaten. He aims the crossbow at Ros and orders her to begin, as Daisy screams.\n\nRos is captured by Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, who mistakenly believes that she is Tyrion's lover (as a result of the Lannister pendant Tyrion gave Ros in Winterfell). She has Ros beaten and kept prisoner. She plans to use her captivity to force Tyrion into keeping Joffrey safe, believing that Tyrion is plotting to kill him. When Cersei says that she has his whore, Tyrion - thinking she has the dark-haired Shae - remarks that he thought she preferred blondes, but it is red-haired Ros that she has brought in and displayed beaten to him. Cersei explains that she will kill her in the most gruesome way, if harm comes to Joffrey while he mans the city walls, as Tyrion plans. Tyrion plays along to maintain the secret that Shae is his true lover; Ros does the same. Tyrion vows to free Ros and she begs him not to forget her.\n\nSome time after the Battle of Blackwater Bay Ros was freed, and is then visited by Varys, though she doesn't realize who he is until she discovers his eunuch status. Varys gets Ros to admit she's afraid of Littlefinger, and tells her that unlike her current employer, he protects those who work for him.\n\nRos accompanies Littlefinger to the docks, where he has a quiet word with Sansa Stark. Left alone with Shae, Ros explains that she helps Littlefinger manage his affairs. She also tells Shae of the day Sansa was born, when all the bells in Winterfell were rung in celebration. Ros asks Shae to watch out for Sansa. When the Lorathi responds that she always does, Ros clarifies that she is referring specifically to Baelish. Following Tyrion's appointment as the new Master of Coin, Ros assists him and Littlefinger in retrieving the Iron Throne's financial records from their hiding place under the floor of the brothel's office. Ros titillates Podrick Payne during the exchange, apparently for her own amusement.  Ros is revealed to be meeting regularly with Varys to report on Littlefinger. She updates a slightly incredulous Varys on Podrick's apparently prodigious sexual skills, which she has had trouble verifying as the usually descriptive prostitutes he slept with seem to have been rendered speechless. When Varys asks how Littlefinger reacted, Ros says he didn't even notice and expresses concern about his plans for Lady Sansa. She presents Varys with a shipping manifest for Littlefinger's upcoming journey to the Vale. Surprising the Spider with the revelation that she is literate, Ros points out that Littlefinger has requisitioned two feather beds for his cabin - he is planning on taking someone important with him: Sansa.When Littlefinger finds out she is spying on him for Varys, he gives her to King Joffrey, who wanted to try something \"new and daring\". Joffrey uses Ros as a live target, brutally killing her by having her tied to his bed and shooting her multiple times with a crossbow, his first personal kill.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ros"}}

House Blackwood is one of the few major houses outside of the North that continues to worship the Old Gods of the Forest, and Finn does so.\n\nFinn had an affair with a woman who was married to a lord's son. After the lordling found out about the affair between Finn and his wife, he attempted to murder Finn with a dagger. But Finn easily overpowered the lordling and killed him with his own dagger. He kept the dagger as a trophy. To avoid the death sentence of a common man murdering a nobleman, he went to the Wall.\n\nAt the Wall he began bullying his fellow brothers-in-training. He is trained under Frostfinger, but talks when he addresses the recruits, bragging about his sexual exploits and his murder of a lordling to Gared Tuttle and Cotter. He then takes part in training. He proves himself to be a competent sword-fighter, but lacks restraint and wins through brute strength. He refuses to pick up a crossbow, considering it a coward's weapon, and laughs when Cotter accidentally shoots himself in the toe. He helps lift barrels, and does so with great ease, hefting it over his shoulder, but knocks into Gared in an attempt to make him drop the barrel he's carrying. As he's boasting that he doesn't need to fire a crossbow because he can hit the target with his dagger, he realizes it's missing. He soon works out Cotter has pick-pocketed it and a fight breaks out. Frostfinger breaks up the fight and takes Finn away for punishment, when Finn refuses, Frostfinger smacks him across the face for his insolence and leads him away.\n\nFinn is made a ranger and goes to the weirwood tree to say his vows with Cotter and Gared, on the way Gared has the option to patch things up with Finn if he stood up for Cotter where he admits the only reason he got so mad at Gared was because he was the closest thing he had to a friend. When they return to Castle Black, Finn stands with Cotter, waiting for Gared to finish talking to his uncle, Duncan. As they stand around Finn and Cotter discuss whether pissing off the Wall could kill a man standing below. Finn and Cotter ask Gared what his uncle came to Castle Black for, Gared lies and Finn comments that he's lying to his brothers already. When Jon Snow decides to go to Craster's Keep to kill their treacherous brothers, both Finn and Cotter agree to go. Cotter reveals he stole Gared's map of the North Grove, Finn laughs at Gared for believing in a rumour told to children and leaves.\n\nFinn is on duty on the Wall when Gared approaches him next, Finn talks about how he doesn't trust Cotter. Finn waits for his relief, complaining to Frostfinger that they're late. Frostfinger is unmoved. Finn leaves and Gared is attacked by Britt, he returns to witness Gared standing over Britt's Body and flees.\n\nAfter Gared is arrested by Frostfinger, Finn (falsely) testifies that he witnessed the fight stating either that Gared acted in self defense or murdered Britt in cold blood depending how Gared treated Finn in previous episodes. After Cotter frees Gared from his prison cell in Castle Black, the two may encounter Finn and he will request to join you in deserting the Nights Watch if he testified in Gared's favor earlier.\n\nUpon going North, they are encountered by a group of female wildlings to which Finn warns Gared not to go near them when Cotter is pinned down by them. After the fight, Finn and Gared carry a wounded Cotter through the Northern Forest, to an abandoned wilding camp, where they encounter Sylvi, Cotter's sister.\n\nIf brought along, the group rest up in the Northern Forest, Finn stands guard keeping watch, he can be interacted with after Gared's talk with Cotter stating that he wanted to come but it isn't how he'd think it'd turn out. He then tends to the fire with Cotter but then a cry for help comes from Finn, the group are encountered by wights.\n\nDuring the fight with the wights, Finn moves Gared out of the way after he unsuccessfully tries to kill a wight and tells him that anything can be killed. He battles a wight but is impaled in his upper abdomen by one of the wight's spear, he is told to stay with them while Gared fights off the rest of the remaining wights.\n\nAfter the last wight is killed, Cotter asks where Finn is to which Gared will run to where he had left Finn only to find that he has died from his injury.\n\nFinn is not present in this episode at all if he wasn't brought in episode 4.\n\nIf Finn was killed in the previous episode then his body is among the wights that attack the inhabitants of the North Grove during which Gared kills the cursed body by setting it on fire.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Finn"}}

They are people kidnapped during raids and forced to toil at tasks such as agriculture and mining, which the ironborn despise. In a raid, most are put to the sword, but those who are unlikely to cause trouble and have particular skills and uses are taken as thralls. Like \"salt wives,\" they have a low status in ironborn society."],"name":"Thrall","description":"A thrall isn't quite the same as a slave, as even the ironborn raiders don't believe in \"slavery\" as such. Thralls are captured in raids, by \"paying the iron price\", but cannot be bought or sold like animals. The ironborn generally look down on selling slaves, as they still think of their captives as human beings, albeit on the bottom rung of society. Thralls are more like \"prisoners of war\". They are officially not considered \"property\", and can own their own property. Any infant born on the Iron Islands, even to two thralls, is considered ironborn. Such children cannot legally be taken away from their parents until the age of seven, when they have to join a ship's crew or take on an apprenticeship. There are even Houses that descend from thralls, such as House Codd and House Humble, though they are looked down upon because of their origins.\n\nAccording to sketchy accounts and oral tradition, the First Men apparently practiced thralldom when they first migrated to Westeros about 12,000 years ago. Over the centuries, however, it fell out of practice - many centuries before the Andal Invasion (6,000 years ago), and possibly even before The Long Night (8,000 years ago). Maesters have taken this as a strong piece of evidence (one of several) that the original ironborn were indeed an offshoot of the First Men, not - as a few of the ironborn claim - that they were an entirely separate ethnic group from the First Men or Andals, and came to the islands from far across the sea.\n\nThe soil of the Iron Islands is very poor, and many minor lords cannot afford draft animals like horses or oxen, and thus their thralls and smallfolk have to pull the plows themselves. The only appreciable natural resource the Iron Islands possess on land is iron mines (of course): their yields are typically produced from backbreaking mining by thralls. Only the largest island, Great Wyk, possesses plentiful enough iron mines that its ruling Houses gain more wealth from the land than from the sea. Thralls who work the fields of the Iron Islands usually grow old and can even raise their own families, but thralls doomed to the mines often die from exhaustion after only a few short years.\n\nAegon I Targaryen put an end to the ironborn taking thralls from Westeros itself, but it is tacitly acknowledged that they still take thralls from further afield, i.e. by raiding the ships and coasts of the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay, or by periodically conducting small raids on the fishing villages of the Stony Shore or Bear Island.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Thrall"}}

The fighting pits are abolished along with slavery itself, as the pit fighters are all slaves. However, the Wise Masters of Yunkai return to power and enslave all their freedmen, so Daenerys sends a Great Master at her service, Hizdahr zo Loraq, to negotiate with the Wise Masters, and Daario Naharis and his Second Sons to serve as a threat. When Hizdahr and Daario return they report that their negotiations were successful: the Wise Masters will comply with her abolition of slavery and set up a ruling council of former slaveholders and freedman, as long as Daenerys reopens the fighting pits in Meereen. At first, Daenerys cannot tolerate this concession, even though Hizdahr insists that free men would fight free men willingly - as many of the former pit fighters were left without work, and eagerly want the gladiatorial games to be reopened. Hizdahr also insists that fighting pits are important to the local traditions of Yunkai and Meereen, but Daenerys still says no.\n\nLater at night when Daenerys is in bed with Daario, he also says that she should reopen the fighting pits. He explains that he was sold into slavery when he was twelve, and ended up in Tolos, where he was trained as a pit fighter and entered the combat when he was sixteen. He did so well that he was eventually freed, and used his combat training to become a high-ranking officer in the Second Sons. As he says, the fighting pits give the gladiators opportunities to rise above their positions at the bottom of society.\n\nAn escalation of the attacks by the local insurgent group of the Sons of the Harpy, which results in the death of Ser Barristan Selmy, makes Daenerys reconsider her position and decide to reopen the fighting pits, as well as betrothing herself to Hizdahr zo Loraq.\n\nJust outside Meereen, Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont are sold into indentured servitude \u2014actually a thinly veiled form of slavery\u2014 and their new master Yezzan brings them and his other servants to the lower fighting pits in order to test them, telling them those who survive will get to fight at the Great Pit of Daznak in front of the Queen.\n\nOn the first day of the Great Games at Daznak's Pit, the Sons of the Harpy come out of hiding and stage an attack against Daenerys and those loyal to her.

Martin has said that the Faith of the Seven is analogous to the Catholic Church in his medieval fantasy world, the High Septon is analogous to the medieval Papacy. The High Septon is selected by an inner council of the Faith called the Most Devout, who are analogous to the College of Cardinals.\n\nThe Faith of the Seven has both male and female priests, known as Septons and Septas. Even the council of the Most Devout is known to possess several female members during the time of the books. It isn't clear if there has ever been a High Septa, but there has also never been any mention of a formal rule against a female priest heading the Faith of the Seven.\n\nA quirk of the position of High Septon in Westeros is that the current office-holder is supposed to leave behind his original name, and it is not permitted to refer to him by it. Thus while a medieval Pope might take on a regnal name (i.e. Hildebrand became known as Pope Gregory VII), or even continue to use his original name, the High Septon is only referred to as \"the High Septon\". This rule remains in effect even long after their death, when someone else is the current High Septon. This of course can become very confusing when members of the Faith are discussing actions and policies of different High Septons, often having to resort to crude descriptive monikers like \"the fat one\", \"the bald one\", or \"the High Septon before the last High Septon\", etc.\n\nSince the High Septon speaks for the Seven on earth, harming him is considered as striking at the gods themselves, and killing him is a deicide.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/High_Septon"}}

Her sole sibling is her younger brother, Jojen Reed. Having grown up in the North, she is a firm believer in the Old Gods of the Forest. \n\nAs Bran, Rickon, Osha, Hodor, Summer, and Shaggydog are fleeing towards Castle Black following the Sack of Winterfell, Meera surprises Osha by placing a knife to her throat so that Osha will drop her wooden spear aimed on the back of Jojen's neck. Jojen tells that they have been searching for a long time so that they can offer their protection. Osha remarks that Jojen must be ashamed to have to rely on his sister for protection, but Meera dismisses her, claiming that some people will always need protection, but that doesn't mean they are any less of a person. \n\nOsha and Meera continue to not get along, fighting over simple things like how best to skin a rabbit. Meera also cares for her brother while he is having seizure-like symptoms when he is having visions.\n\nWhile in the Gift, the group seeks shelter from a rainstorm in an abandoned windmill when Meera spots a horse. She and the others witness the man being surrounded by wildlings and fear that a scared Hodor yelling will alert the wildlings to their hiding place, but Bran uses his powers to enter Hodor's mind and make him sleep. Bran decides that he and Rickon should separate and that Osha and Shaggydog go with him. Before she leaves, Osha makes Meera and Jojen promise to keep Bran safe.\n\nMeera arrives with the remaining members of the group at Nightfort, a long unused Night's Watch castle along the Wall. Bran recalls a lot of scary stories he had heard from Old Nan about Nightfort, but Meera expresses her love of scary stories so Bran retells the legend of the Rat Cook. Suddenly, a dark figure appears from a well, frightening the group. Meera pins the figure down, knife in hand, yet it is only Samwell Tarly with Gilly and her baby. After discovering who each other are, Samwell warns Bran and the others of the White Walkers, but Bran insists that although he would like to join Samwell at Castle Black, he and the others must continue on their quest. Samwell supplies them dragonglass, and noticing that Meera uses a bow, gives her extra for her arrows.\n\nMeera interrupts Bran's warging, stating that he was gone for hours. Jojen warns Bran of the dangers of staying within the minds of others for too long. Meera supports her brother, insisting to Bran that he would forget his friends, his family, his home, and even himself.\n\nAround their campfire at night, Meera and her companions hears the cries of a baby (Craster's last son left outside by Rast). Bran wargs into Summer to investigate, but notices Ghost in a cage and Summer falls into a trap. They discover the mutineers at Craster's Keep, but Meera insists they leave the area. Bran wants to free the trapped direwolves, but they are ambushed by the mutineers and taken to Karl. Karl threatens Meera and Jojen, which forces Bran to reveal his identity to them.\n\nLater, Karl and other mutineers prepare to rape Meera in front of her companions, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Jon Snow and the Night's Watch. During the ensuing battle, Locke finds the four of them and takes Bran away, intending to kill him. Bran wargs into Hodor and kills Locke by snapping his neck. As the raid on Craster's Keep continues, Bran, Jojen, Meera, and Hodor escape. As they are walking to the great Weirwood tree her brother is grabbed from beneath the snow and dragged by a wight, but Meera comes to his aid before he is dragged beneath the snow. Meera successfully protects him from the Wights and pushes Jojen to the ground before it can kill him. As Jojen lies in the snow, Meera takes her eyes off him and continues to fight other Wights. While Meera is distracted, a Wight lying next to Jojen that she believed to be dead, pulls out a knife and stabs him repeatedly. Leaf tells her that he is lost, and he tells her to leave him for dead, but before leaving slits his throat out of mercy. She gets inside the cave and follows Leaf with Bran and Hodor where they meet the three-eyed raven.\n\nMeera remains in the Weirwood cave with Bran, Summer, Hodor, Leaf, and the Three-eyed Raven. After Bran has a vision of his father as a child, he finds Meera sitting just outside the cave entrance. She confides in him that she is having trouble coping with their apparent inaction towards the coming war, and Bran reminds her that it's not safe anywhere outside. After he leaves, a child of the forest tells her that she needs to protect Bran at all costs.  While Meera is sleeping one night, Bran comes into contact with the Night King. When he wakes up and cries out, Meera awakens as well. The Three-eyed Raven informs them of their situation. She briefly speaks to Hodor before realizing how close the White Walkers are. Meera rushes to the entrance of the cave and sees the vast army of the dead approaching. On Leaf's orders, she dashes back into the cave, picks up a spear, and frantically tries to wake Bran up from his latest vision. Meera's latest words enter Bran's thoughts, and as the wights enter the cave, she encourages him to warg into Hodor. She kills several wights and successfully shatters one White Walker with her spear. She carries Bran out of the cave in a cart, begging both present and past Hodor to \"hold the door\". Although all the other inhabitants of the cave perish, Meera escapes the battle alive with Bran.\n\nMeera struggles to pull both Bran and the cart as they continue to run from the White Walkers. Bran remains despondent, and continues to have visions of both past, present, and future. They are eventually found by the Wight horde just as Bran wakes up, and Meera apologizes for not being able to protect him due to their sheer numbers and her exauhstion. Just before the Wights close in, however, a mysterious figure clad in a hooded black cloak arrives, killing the Wights with a flaming chain. He pulls Bran and Meera up onto his horse, and they ride away.\n\nThe mysterious figure, once they have found a safe place to make a fire, reveals himself as Benjen Stark, Bran's uncle, who has previously been thought to be dead. He claims that he was attacked by White Walkers while on a ranging party, and left for dead after being stabbed through the gut, and that the magic of the Children of the Forest saved his life. He also tells Bran that he has now embodied the Three-eyed raven, and must face the Night King when the time comes.\n\nMeera, Bran, and Benjen eventually arrive at the weirwood tree, not far from the wall. Claiming that the magic of the Children of the Forest prevents him from passing beyond the Wall, Benjen says his farewells and once again disapears into the forest. Meera watches while Bran connects to the tree and sees a vision of his aunt Lyanna's death, and the birth of Jon Snow.\n\nAfter arriving at the wall, Meera and Bran are met by the acting Lord Commander of Night's Watch Eddison Tollett. Meera introduces herself as the daughter of Howland Reed and Bran as well, though Tollett demands some sort of proof that the two of them are indeed who they say they are. Bran delivers an ominous warning regarding the arrival of winter and the white walkers, and Eddison allows them to pass through the wall.\n\nTogether with Bran, Meera arrives at Winterfell where she witnesses Bran reuniting with his sister Sansa.\n\nLater, Meera comes to Bran's chambers, explaining that she needs to go back to Greywater Watch, to be with her family when the White Walkers come. When all Bran has to say is \"thank you\", Meera angrily says that Bran is only alive due to the sacrifices made by her brother, Summer and Hodor. However, when Bran says that he is no longer \"Bran Stark\", and is now only the three-eyed raven, Meera agrees, saying that the real Bran died in the cave of the three-eyed raven. Meera then leaves Winterfell and returns to her home.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Meera_Reed"}}

He was accompanying the rest of Yoren's new recruits northwards to the Wall before taken prisoner and inducted into the Lannister army.\n\nWhen looking for fresh recruits for the Night's Watch, Yoren was given permission by Lord Eddard Stark, Hand of the King to go through the dungeons and take any criminals who would swear to take the black. He chose murderer Rorge as a potential candidate, as well as two other criminals Jaqen H'ghar and Biter from the black cells, where the worst criminals are kept.\n\nRorge is in the party led by Yoren that leaves King's Landing for the Wall, along with Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands, Gendry, and Arya Stark who is being smuggled out to be returned to Winterfell. Because Yoren is traveling so far with so few men, the worst three criminals are kept in a locked barred cell on the back of a wagon.\n\nRorge is kept inside a cage alongside Biter and Jaqen H'ghar for their trip to the Wall, because they are dangerous prisoners from the city's dungeons. When Jaqen asks \"Arry\" for water, Rorge demands beer and insults Arya, who says that he should have asked nicely and hits Rorge's hand with a stick. He recoils and then tries to grab Arya through the cage. Biter moves up behind Rorge and hisses as Rorge threatens Arya again.\n\nThe group is resting in a barn when they are roused to arms by Yoren and told they are being attacked. As they rush outside one man trips and drops his torch, setting a fire near the prisoner wagon. They are met by Ser Amory Lorch and a force of men loyal to House Lannister. Lorch points out the Gold Cloaks with him and says that they have come for Gendry, a royal bastard. Lorch orders Yoren and the recruits to drop their weapons. Yoren remains defiant and Lorch orders him shot.\n\nSeeing their leader killed, Gendry and many of the other recruits join the fight. Arya is distracted by Jaqen calling for help as the flames lick the bars of the cage. She hands him an axe before rushing to join the fray. They use it to escape the wagon. Gendry is overwhelmed and knocked down. As Arya runs round a corner she is knocked over and taken prisoner along with the other survivors.\n\nRorge, Biter and Jaqen are inducted into the Lannister army. They serve at Harrenhal, where their former fellow recruits are also taken as captives. Arya approaches Rorge and Biter, she is looking for Jaqen. Rorge repeats his earlier threats and shows no acknowledgement of her saving his life, calling her Yoren's little cunt. They then leave Harrenhal.\n\nArya and The Hound come across a homestead recently burned and pillaged by Rorge and Biter. After granting a mortally wounded peasant a merciful death, The Hound is suddenly ambushed from behind by Biter and bitten. The Hound overpowers Biter and kills him by snapping his neck. Rorge appears, and recognizes The Hound. He tells them about Joffrey's death, and says there is a price on Sandor's head for killing Lannister soldiers. The Hound is unimpressed, but Arya remembers Rorge as the prisoner of the Night's Watch who threatened to \"fuck her bloody\" with a stick. Sandor asks if he's on her list, and she replies that he can't be because she doesn't know his name. The Hound asks him; as soon as Rorge replies, Arya swiftly kills him with a quick thrust of Needle to the heart.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rorge"}}

Malcolm voices support for Ser Royland Degore. As the situation for House Forrester worsens, his sister Elissa realizes the lack of skilled swords and strong men at her houses' disposal. Elissa speaks to Malcolm and instructs him to go to Essos to find her exiled, and dangerous, son Asher. As the new lord of House Forrester, it is up to Ethan, the newly appointed child lord to decide whether to follow this plan through or defy his own mother's request.\n\nMalcolm appears in Yunkai in time to save Asher and Beskha fight the Lost Legion and they escape the inn. He then fills Asher in on what is happening back in Westeros, he also reveals that retrieving Asher is not the only reason he is there. He also wants to gain the assistance of a sellsword army in order to aid his family. The three of them then manage to escape Yunkai and head north to Meereen in order to find a suitable mercenary company currently working for Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nThe episode opens to Malcolm and Asher waiting for Beskha to return from checking if the Lost Legion were still after them. Malcolm expresses his doubt that Beskha can be trusted and exclaims that she is costing them invaluable time - time they need in order to get back to Talia and Ryon. The group continues to travel along the ravine until their path is blocked by some rubble. Malcolm suggests searching for a cave, to which Beskha will agree with if her opinion is asked. When prompted, Malcolm will explain to Asher that the reason he is so distrustful and harsh towards Beskha is because she is \"immaterial\" compared to Asher; Asher is his main focus and only concern during the mission.  When Asher finds a cave, the Lost Legion find them and Malcolm helps fend them off while Asher looks for a new escape. They have unknowingly entered a dragons lair. When the trio and their enemies are faced with the appearance of Drogon, one of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, Malcolm is stabbed in the leg by one of the Lost Legion soldiers. Asher then faces a difficult decision of saving his uncle, or helping Beskha fight off the dragon. If Malcolm is helped, he and Asher will pair up to fight the Lost Legion. If Malcolm is left alone, Malcolm will manage to survive and fight them off on his own.\n\nFinding their way into Meereen, Malcolm helps Asher persuade an old friend, Croft, to help them bring back an army. If he was not helped, Malcolm will inquire Asher about his decision to help Beskha instead of him, saying that he could not have known they would both make it out alive. Malcolm will be disappointed and hurt, but will continue on his mission with him nonetheless. While Croft cannot help them as he swore loyalty to the Khaleesi, Malcolm and the others knowledge of where her missing dragon is helps them set up a meeting with the Queen herself. The episode ends with Malcolm, Asher, and Beskha entering Daenerys tent and coming face-to-face with her for the first time.\n\nStanding before the Khaleesi herself, Daenerys Targaryen, with Asher and Beskha, Malcolm is present as Asher plans to plead for her help and the assistance of her sellswords. One of Daenerys dragons fly in from behind her, startling Malcolm, and prompting him to keep his hand near his sword. As Daenerys tests Asher's confidence by encouraging him to pet her dragon, Malcolm and Beskha share a rare moment of agreement as they tell him not to. Regardless of whether Asher pets the dragon or not, Asher will eventually make his request for her sellswords. However, Asher's offer is rejected due to her own mission of invading Meereen and freeing the slaves.\n\nIf Asher does not say this first, Malcolm will suggest that they fight alongside of her with the aid of Beskha's knowledge of the city. Beskha is angered by this, as she despises Meereen for unknown reasons. Despite the animosity between Malcolm and Beskha because of this outburst, Daenerys takes the trio up on their offer, promising that she will consider helping them if she is successful in her mission. Malcolm is told by Daenerys to stay behind as Asher and Beskha leave. Malcolm's final appearance of the episode is a shot of him watching Asher and Beskha leave from inside the tent as the flap closes.\n\nWhile he is not present for the attack on Meereen, his name is mentioned throughout the episode. It is Malcolm's suggestion of relying on Beskha for the mission that triggers her memories of being enslaved inside the city as a child. It is assumed that Malcolm is unaware of this as he was not around for this breakdown.\n\nWhen Asher and Beskha return from their raid in Meeren, Malcolm greets them outside of Daenerys' tent, before bringing them in. Daenerys mentions if you obey Croft's orders that Malcolm told her Asher was a man of integrity, which she now believes.\n\nBefore Asher, Beskha, and Malcolm can leave, Daenerys says she has other plans for Malcolm, much to the confusion of Asher's group. She wishes Malcolm to stay and serve her. He cites that he owes allegiance to his family, but Daenerys counters that they will be grateful for the alliance with her that he helped forge. He asks to discuss it with Asher, which she agrees, but pleads with him to give her his answer soon.\n\nAsher is shocked that Malcolm would consider staying in Essos. Malcolm counters that Daenerys is someone they would want on their side if she ever came to Westeros. Malcolm also notes that Asher made a good start with her and he could strengthen that bond. He argues that she takes the Iron Throne, she would be the only ally they need. While Asher and Beskha go off to acquire pit fighters, he goes to further discuss with the queen.  Malcolm then arrives at Asher's boat with the pit fighters he acquired. Malcolm is proud that Asher came through for his family. He however decides to stay in Essos and serve Daenerys, who has a mission for him, the details he does not know besides. He wishes to help her reclaim the Iron Throne, reminding Asher of what kind of ally she would be if she would succeed. He believes that all the time Asher spent in Essos has made him a better person, that he is his father's son, and despite their differences, he would be proud. He states he will send a raven ahead to Ironrath, informing them of Asher's departure. His final words to Asher before he departs for Westeros are \"Iron From Ice.\"\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Malcolm_Branfield"}}

However, after arriving, Borros almost immediately sent Lucerys away, having already made a pact with Aemond Targaryen. During their way back to Dragonstone, a storm began just after they rose into the sky. Arax was struggling, as Aemond arose on his dragon Vhagar, who was five times the size of Arax. As the castle watchers of Storm's End looked up at the sky, it was illuminated by a single flame, and then followed by a shriek that even drowned out the thunder. Then, Vhagar clasped her teeth so hard around Arax's neck, until he was decapitated. His rider would later fall from his mount and drown in Shipbreaker Bay.\n\nPrincess Rhaenyra Targaryen's three eldest sons (each by Laenor Velaryon) were Jacaerys (born 114 AC), Lucerys (born 115 AC), and Joffrey (born 117 AC). The rival faction at court who supported her stepmother Alicent Hightower and her children spread the accusation that Rhaenyra's three sons were not really Laenor's, but bastards fathered by Harwin Strong. In an effort to confirm that he considered Rhaenyra and her sons the true heirs to the throne, her father King Viserys I decreed that a dragon egg would be put in the cradle of each of the boys, to bond with the dragons that hatched from them. Those who doubted the paternity of Rhaenyra's sons also doubted that the eggs would ever hatch, but they were quickly disappointed, as each of the eggs soon hatched in turn. The hatchlings were named Vermax (bonded with Jacaerys), Arrax (bonded with Lucerys), and Tyraxes (bonded with Joffrey). The exact date each hatched is not known but the last seems to have hatched by no later than about 120 AC.\n\nAt the start of the civil war Prince Jacaerys flew north as a messenger on Vermax. Arrax and his rider were slain by Prince Aemond Targaryen and Vhagar in the skies over Shipbreaker Bay.

His true name is unknown, as \"Lem\" is actually short for \"Lemoncloak\" - after the yellow cloak he wears. He is described as big and brawny, with a soldier look to him, as well as a bushy brown beard and bad teeth.

The Stark boys find him near death on the edge of the black pool, beneath the shelter of the heart tree."],"name":"Luwin","description":"Luwin is a Maester, a learned man of science and medicine, and serves House Stark of Winterfell. House Stark are Lords Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Luwin is very loyal to the Starks and they value his wise counsel and experience. He delivered all five of Lady Catelyn's children. He serves as a tutor to the male children.\n\nLuwin organizes the preparations for a royal visit with Catelyn Stark. Catelyn spots Bran climbing Winterfell's walls and scolds her son in front of Luwin. Luwin stands behind the Starks as King Robert arrives. The next night Luwin delivers a letter from Lysa Arryn to Catelyn and Eddard Stark. He discusses its content with them and counsels that given Lysa's claims that the Lannisters killed Jon Arryn it is important that Eddard take up Robert's offer to make him Hand of the King. Bran is injured in what seems to have been a climbing accident.\n\nLuwin tends to Bran's injuries and predicts that he will survive. Eddard goes to King's Landing to serve as hand and takes many of his retainers with him. Luwin goes to Catelyn to discuss finances and appointing replacements. Catelyn is distraught over Bran's condition and refuses to participate. Robb Stark agrees to work with Luwin instead. An assassin attempts to kill Bran but is foiled by Bran's direwolf Summer. Luwin meets with Catelyn, Robb, Theon Greyjoy, and Rodrik Cassel in the Gods Wood of Winterfell to discuss the circumstances of Bran's injury. Catelyn reveals that she found a blond hair inside the tower where he was found. Luwin cautions restraint and Catelyn plans to go south personally to deliver the news to Eddard. Bran awakens after she leaves but is paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nLuwin meets with Tyrion Lannister in the main hall of Winterfell alongside Robb. They offer a cool reception until Tyrion provides plans for a saddle that would allow Bran to ride. Luwin tutors Bran on the regions and families in the Seven Kingdoms and notes that amongst House Greyjoy's noted skills is a tendency towards failed rebellions. Bran is upset at the continued absence of his parents and sullenly tries to provoke Luwin.\n\nLuwin warns off Theon Greyjoy from Osha, a wildling prisoner captured near the castle. He then questions Osha himself. She claims that the White Walkers are on the move. He dismisses this as a fable, but Osha tells him that the Walkers were not wiped out thousands of years ago, but have merely been asleep. She claims that they are not asleep any more.\n\nEddard is arrested for treason after the death of Robert. A letter from Sansa reaches Winterfell, pleading with a disbelieving Robb to bend the knee to Joffrey Baratheon. Maester Luwin correctly identifies the letter as the work of Queen Cersei. Robb refuses to consider the request and sends out ravens, summoning Eddard's lords bannermen to assemble their armies at Winterfell. Robb marches south leaving Luwin to care for Bran. Eddard is executed for treason on King Joffrey's orders. Luwin tells Bran and Rickon the news of Eddard's death.\n\nAs Maester at Winterfell, he becomes ever more of a father-figure to Bran and Rickon with their father dead and their mother away. He provides council to Bran as he acts as Lord of Winterfell. Bran questions Luwin about his strange dreams and Luwin reveals to him the valyrian steel link in his Maester chain, the sign that he studied the \"higher mysteries\" - magic - and asserts that if magic ever existed it has left their world long ago.\n\nTheon Greyjoy, who was last seen riding off with Robb, later returns to Winterfell with a crew of fellow ironborn. They lure the garrison of Winterfell away by feinting at Torrhen's Square and then seize the poorly defended castle. Luwin is able to send word to King Robb Stark before being captured. Theon assembles Luwin and the rest of Winterfell's inhabitant in the courtyard where he has Bran publicly surrender the castle to him. He then turns to Luwin and orders him to send ravens to his father and sister, informing them of his victory. Upon noticing Luwin's icy stare, Theon asks Luwin if he remembers his oath to serve the Lord of Winterfell. Luwin grudgingly replies he does, and Theon reminds him that he is now the Lord of Winterfell and repeats his order. Luwin walks off to do as he is told but then Ser Rodrik Cassel, Winterfell's castellan and master-at-arms, is forcefully brought forward to Theon by Lorren and another ironborn. When Theon sentences Ser Rodrik to death after the latter openly spits in his face, Luwin tries to convince Theon not to make a hasty decision and that Ser Rodrik is worth more to him alive than dead. Theon briefly considers Luwin's advice but ultimately dismisses him, threatening to have him executed as well if he doesn't back down. Theon then proceeds to execute Ser Rodrik to the horror of Bran, Luwin, and the rest of Winterfell's inhabitants.\n\nWhen Osha frees the boys and flees the castle, Theon has Luwin accompany him as he attempts to hunt the escapees down. Luwin begs him to spare them. They lose their scent at a nearby farm. Theon has Luwin sent home and then later returns to Winterfell with the burned corpses of two children, publicly claiming that they are Bran and Rickon. The citizens of Winterfell scream and sob at the sight, but Luwin's scream of anguish is the loudest and most painful to hear. A few days later, Luwin spots Osha sneaking into the catacombs. He realizes that the corpses must be Jack and Billy, the two orphans whom Bran had assigned to assist a kindly shepherd, and follows her to confirm his suspicion. She tells him they doubled back through a stream to mask their scent. Luwin urges her to keep the truth of Theon's actions from the boys, saying Bran specifically would blame himself. Unbeknownst to Luwin, however, Bran overhears everything.\n\nWinterfell is later surrounded by Northmen under the command of Ramsay Snow, Lord Roose Bolton's bastard son, who infuriates Theon by blowing a horn all through the night. Despite acknowledging how kind his captors were to him, Theon tearfully vents his anguish over being constantly reminded by everyone, including Luwin, how lucky he was to be a prisoner of the Starks. Assuming a much more sympathetic tone, Luwin advises Theon to flee to the Wall and join the Night's Watch so that he might save his life and redeem himself, adding he knows Theon is not the ruthless man he is pretending to be. Theon owes to Luwin that he has done terrible things but refuses to deviate from the course he has set, saying that is too late and he has gone too far to ever pretend to be anyone else, and also fearing that Jon Snow will most likely kill him for his actions. He tries to rally his men for battle, not knowing they plan to hand him over to the Northmen in exchange for their own lives. When Theon concludes his speech to his fellow Ironborn, they immediately initiate their plan and knock him out. Despite Theon's betrayal, Luwin is visibly mortified when he sees what the Ironborn are doing and tries to intervene but ends up fatally stabbed by Dagmer, who then has Theon dragged away.\n\nDespite his injury, Luwin escapes from Winterfell before she is sacked by Ramsay and makes his way to the godswood, where he lies bleeding by the pool. Near death, he is found by Bran, Rickon, Osha and Hodor. He insists that the boys go north to the Wall as there are too many enemies in the south. He tells them that Jon will be able to keep them safe and tell their mother of their survival. Luwin affirms his pride at having served the Starks, particularly in raising their children. He sends them away and asks Osha to give him a quick death; having grown to greatly respect the Starks and their fellows, Osha does so.\n\nFollowing House Bolton's extinction after the Battle of the Bastards, Maester Wolkan is appointed to serve as House Stark's new maester to replace Luwin. While discussing food rations for the North, Wolkan promises to refer to Luwin's old notes for information regarding the century's longest winter, as Luwin kept records of every raven scroll.\n\nWhen Arya Stark returns to Winterfell, she asks for Luwin and Rodrik Cassel to prove her identity to two disbelieving guards, but is informed that the maester at Winterfell is now Wolkan, meaning that Luwin cannot prove her identity.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Luwin"}}

After Robert was killed in a hunt, which Lancel was partly responsible for, Lancel was knighted and this made him a tad bolder - more accurately, it made Lancel entitled, pompous, arrogant and melodramatic, speaking down to Tyrion as if he were a title superior to him and using his title as a knight in order to justify actions. When Joffrey had Ser Meryn Trant beat Sansa Stark in public, Lancel callously recited Robb Stark's recent victory against a Lannister army, making no attempt to save Sansa from harm despite knowing she was playing no role in House Stark's rebellion against the Crown. He still remained timid and cowardly, falling to pieces at the prospect of Joffrey hearing about his encounters with Cersei.\n\nLancel's future experiences seemed to change slightly. Even after he was wounded and became slavishly devoted to the Faith Militant and the High Sparrow, he still maintained an arrogant and self-righteous attitude. With the rest of the Faith Militant to back him up, Lancel would repeatedly try to intimidate others regardless of these people being lords, priests or generally powerful people. He was also still rather timid, backing off slightly when faced with the Mountain (though this can be considered natural, since the Mountain frightens everyone). That being said, he was not incapable of being self-reproachful and he seemed to be genuinely apologetic about 'leading' Cersei on into their unlawful relationship, which is in stark contrast to when he literally was rendered speechless when confronted by Tyrion with the consequences of what he had done. In his final moments, after being stabbed, he shed tears of fear while trying to reach the candle that would ignite the wildfire to bring the Great Sept of Baelor down; Lancel was the first to be killed.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lancel_Lannister"}}

However, it is unknown precisely how these abilities are acquired, and their effectiveness is not always certain. Indeed, sometimes the priests themselves express skepticism regarding magic:\n\nMelisandre can see into the future by staring into flames. She is able to show others these visions, as she did for Stannis after his defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, completing his faith in her. She also seemed to know that Matthos Seaworth would die by Wildfire, as she foreshadowed his fate to him before the battle. By staring into Arya Stark's eyes, Melisandre was also able to see the eyes of many other people that Arya would \"shut forever\".\n\nHowever, these visions can be misinterpreted, or they may not manifest in the way the seer expects. Melisandre claims that she saw a vision of herself witnessing the Bolton banners falling from Winterfell and Jon Snow fighting there. Certain that this meant that Stannis would defeat the Boltons with the help of Jon Snow, she becomes temporarily despondent when both Stannis and Jon are killed, believing that everything she saw in the flames was a lie. The vision is apparently fulfilled later, when the resurrected Jon defeats Ramsay Bolton and Melisandre watches the Bolton banners replaced with those of House Stark.\n\nUpon meeting, Kinvara, Varys expresses his skepticisim about religion in general; he claims that practicioners' mentality of \"everything is the Lord's will\" is an excuse for lack of genuine spiritual phenomena. Though unfazed, Kinvara counters by revealing events of Varys' childhood that should have been impossible for her to know about; there were no witnesses to the events and those involved were unlikely to have told anyone, yet she was able to describe them in astonishing detail.\n\nBeric Dondarrion called upon the Lord of Light during his fight with Sandor Clegane, igniting his sword with flame using only his blood.\n\nWhile walking in freezing temperatures at The Wall, Melisandre explains to Jon Snow how she is never cold. She allows him to touch her cheek, claiming that the \"Lord's fire\" lives within her.\n\nMaester Cressen attempted to kill Melisandre by slipping poison into a cup of wine. After realizing that the cup is poisoned, Melisandre drank almost the entire cup without fear, completely unaffected by the poison, while Cressen died moments later from a simple sip. The red amulet around her neck lit up and glowed as this happened.\n\nThoros of Myr showed this ability after Beric Dondarrion fell in combat against Sandor Clegane. By repeatedly chanting \"Lord! cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished, restore it!\" Beric was revived alive and well, his wounds healed within seconds of being slain. When Thoros later explains to Melisandre that he had also done this on five other occasions, she is astonished that it happened at all, let alone that it worked six times. Thoros himself insisted that he has no control over this ability, claiming that he's just a lucky drunk who recites the words, and the Lord of Light apparently sees fit to answers his prayers.\n\nIn the sixth season, Melisandre employs a different and more elaborate ritual in order to resurrect Jon Snow, involving burning pieces of Jon's hair and repeatedly reciting words: \"Zyhys oñoso jehikagon Aeksiot epi, se gis hen syndrorro jemagon. Zyhys perzys stepagon Aeksio Oño jorepi, se morghultas lys qelitsos sikagon. Hen syndrorro, oños. Hen ñuqir, perzys. Hen morghot, glaeson.\" (\"We ask the Lord to shine the light, and take a soul from darkness. We implore the Lord to share their fire and light a candle went out. From darkness, light. From the ashes, fire. From death, life.\"), in High Valyrian. In spite of the differences in ritual, Melisandre's efforts were a success.\n\nSome Red Priests can cast magical glamours, illusions which alter a person's appearance in the minds of others. Melisandre uses a powerful glamour which fools all the senses to disguise her true appearance. In the novels, Melisandre uses this trick to switch Mance Rayder's appearance with the Lord of Bones, allowing Mance to avoid execution so she and Jon Snow can send him to Winterfell and rescue who they believe is Arya Stark from House Bolton.\n\nRed Priests possess a much longer lifespan than most human beings; it's possible that their lifespan is indefinite. Red Priests whose lifespan has been extended are not eternally youthful, however, and their bodies will continue to age. Magical and possibly alchemical glamours are used to disguise this aged appearance, so that the ancient Red Priests still seem young and full of vigor. Melisandre is the only Red Priestess thus far confirmed to possess both this long lifespan and the magical powers necessary to disguise it.\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Red_Priest"}}

When he was 23 years old, the magisters selected him as the new Prince of Pentos after beheading the last prince for failure.

He decides to keep all roads open, to make sure the Windblown are on the winning side, no matter who that shall be. Therefore, he sends about twenty of his sellswords to Meereen, where they bring Daenerys his offer of alliance: the Windblown will fight for her in exchange for Pentos. Daenerys rejects the offer because she wouldn't betray her friend Illyrio, no matter how poor her position is.\n\nShortly before marching out of Meereen to attack the besieging troops, Ser Barristan Selmy sends the Windblown back to the Tattered Prince with a counter-offer: if he rescues the three hostages, whom Daenerys delivered the Yunkai'i and are still held captive (Daario, the bloodrider Jhogo and Hero the Unsullied) - he will get Pentos in return.\n\nDuring the ensuing battle, the Windblown indeed switch sides, and the Tattered Prince kills the Yunkish lord Gorzhak zo Eraz (known as \"Pudding Face\"), who was temporarly the Supreme Commander of the besieging troops. That prompts the Second Sons to switch sides too. The fate of the hostages is unknown, though.\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Windblown"}}

He coerces an unwilling Hot Pie into following them to a nearby inn by making an impressive trick-shot. Later on, he presents a captured Sandor Clegane to his companions and is met with a roar of approval, and is present when Sandor reveals Arya's identity.\n\nAfter bringing his captive before Beric Dondarrion, he voices his disgust over the atrocities committed by the Lannister forces at the Mummer's Ford.. Later he is present during the trial by combat which the Hound kills Lord Beric and is freed from his accusations.\n\nAnguy teaches Arya how to shoot a bow properly, when confronted by Melisandre, who has come to claim Gendry for the Lord of Light. He does nothing to stop her, earning himself the wrath of Arya.\n\nWhen Arya runs away from the Brotherhood, Anguy is sent to bring her back. He is unsuccessful when she is captured by the Hound instead and taken away.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Anguy is a superb archer from the Dornish Marches, the mountainous southern region of the Stormlands which borders Dorne. He won the archery competition during the Tourney of the Hand and was approached by Alyn, a guardsman on orders from Eddard Stark to offer him a place on the Stark household guard, but Anguy drunkenly declined. Anguy is part of the Iron Throne host assembled by Eddard Stark to execute Ser Gregor Clegane and becomes one of the founders of the Brotherhood Without Banners after the Battle at the Mummer's Ford.\n\nMany characters who later formed the Brotherhood were introduced at the Tourney of the Hand in the first novel. This tourney did occur in Season 1 of the TV series, but the characters were not introduced, because they would not really make a significant appearance until Season 3 - they are given cameos in the first novel but only reappear as \"the Brotherhood\" in the third novel (though as in Season 2 of the TV series, in the second novel characters do mention that something called \"the Brotherhood\" is harassing Lannister supply lines).\n\nAt the Tourney of the Hand, Anguy won the archery contest and Thoros of Myr won the melee contest. This is why they arrived in King's Landing, and were available when Ned Stark ordered Beric Dondarrion to lead out a group of able knights to bring Gregor Clegane to justice - the soldiers who formed the original core of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Thus the connection might be lost on the TV audience that one of the reasons the Brotherhood is such a disproportionately capable fighting force is because so many of its initial members were elite fighters who came to the capital city to participate in the Tourney of the Hand. For example it might a bit contrived in the TV series that, as if by pure chance, the Brotherood's lead archer Anguy just happens to be preternaturally skilled with a bow. The books actually do explain that he is a professional archer so skilled that he actively competes in tournaments, and indeed recently won first place at a royal-level archery tournament. Moreover, he doesn't just happen to be wandering in the Riverlands, but the rational reason was given that he was in the capital for a major tournament, before being sent out with Dondarrion.\n\nFollowing the Red Wedding, the Brotherhood has fallen low, its members are no different to regular outlaws. As a result, Anguy and many others have abandoned the Brotherhood.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Anguy"}}

King Robb Stark was disgusted that Lord Rickard would kill two unarmed and captive boys, and without his permission. Declaring it to be murder and treason, Robb sentenced Lord Rickard to death, and (as per Northern custom), personally executed Lord Rickard by beheading him with his own sword.

Harald joined the Karstark army with Ramsay Bolton's main force and engaged the smaller Stark loyalist army at the Battle of the Bastards.

Sansa Stark, Snow's half-sister and advisor, suggests giving Karhold to one of the Northern lords who had been a proven ally of the Starks, but Jon dismisses this idea, as Alys wasn't to blame for Harald Karstark's actions. The argument of what to do with the surviving Karstark and Umber children goes back and forth.  Ultimately, Jon calls Alys and Ned Umber forward.

Ellaria is also initially courteous to Tywin and Cersei at their first meeting but was rather quickly vexed when Cersei hypocritically mocked her bastard surname. When Oberyn went to fight the Mountain, Ellaria expressed shock that he had chosen to fight such a man, and pleaded that he not leave her alone in the world, and she reacted with horror when Gregor Clegane killed him. This shows that she and Oberyn had a genuinely loving relationship. She displays equally strong affection for her eldest daughter, Tyene, and treats Oberyn's two oldest daughters (Obara and Nymeria) with respect, despite them not being her own children.\n\nSince Oberyn's death, however, her personality has completely darkened. Despite the fact that it was ultimately Oberyn's hubris that got him killed, Ellaria has not only inherited his more vengeful side; she has transcended it to a whole new level. This started off as a considerably aggressive attitude towards anyone who crossed her, especially Jaime Lannister. She behaved in an aggressive and spiteful way, and when Doran treated with Jaime, expressed disgust that he was even considering breaking bread with Jaime. Beforehand, she was enraged that he hadn't declared war on the Iron Throne to avenge Oberyn. She became pitiless and dangerous, suggesting that they send Myrcella back to Cersei piece by piece, and later killing her in front of Jaime, all so she could mount a war against House Lannister.\n\nThis being said, Ellaria isn't so blinded by her hatred and revenge that she isn't willing to make alliances as shown when she invites Olenna Tyrell, a member of a family that have been rivals of the Martells for centuries, if it meant that they could take their revenge on Cersei and her family for the damage that they caused to both their families. Still, for all intents and purposes, Ellaria fails to see that she has proven herself no better than the Lannisters by murdering an innocent child and then Oberyn's own brother in cold blood, despite Doran and Trystane having treated her like one of their own family.\n\nThough aware of her baseborn origins, Ellaria's status as a part of Dornish nobility has also hindered her views slightly, such as when she asks Theon Greyjoy to pour her wine despite him legally being Balon Greyjoy's heir to the Iron Islands (which he himself gave up for Yara), and only stops when Yara tells her that Theon is not her servant. Her relaxed attitude towards sexual relations is reflected when she offers Theon to join her and Yara for a threesome, even though Theon and Yara are siblings.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ellaria_Sand"}}

Tommen is good-natured and passive in contrast to his brother Joffrey, who sometimes bullied Tommen for amusement. Like his sister, he is fond of his uncle Tyrion Lannister.","He giggles as his uncle lifts him aside to join them. His sister asks whether Bran Stark will die and Tyrion replies that he is expected to live, much to Myrcella\u2019s delight and Cersei\u2019s horror. Tyrion goes on to say how he wishes to see the Wall and witness the \u201Cwintry abode of the white walkers,\u201D exciting Myrcella and Tommen.

Tywin, in an unusually agreeable mood, enters and proceeds to quiz Tommen on the traits that make a good king, ignoring Cersei's protests and angry glares. Tommen suggests holiness, justice, and strength as qualities of a good king, but Tywin refutes these answers by pointing out that Kings Baelor, Orys, and Robert were each paragons of one of these qualities, but ultimately not very good kings. Tywin is delighted when Tommen, with minimal prompting, deduces that a good king must be wise. Tywin tells Tommen that young kings with no experience can become wise by listening to their councilors, and the wisest kings keep listening even when they don't need to anymore. After admitting that Joffrey was neither good nor wise, Tywin escorts Tommen out of the Sept and begins teaching him the duties of a king's marriage. On their way out, Jaime passes them and asks how Tommen is doing; the young king replies that he is all right, and Jaime assures Tommen that he will not let him meet the same end as his brother.","Later, he voices his frustration and his plans to attack the Sept of Baelor in front of his mother, who manipulates him into letting her handle the situation. When this eventually leads to her capture by the Sparrows, however, Tommen loses his appetite and falls into depression, refusing to eat and staying in his chambers, receiving no one.","Tommen is preparing to attend the trials of his mother and brother-in-law, only to have his progess blocked by Ser Gregor Clegane.","Upon the Iron Bank of Braavos' visit to King's Landing, Tycho Nestoris offers his condolences to Cersei for Tommen's death.","The role of Tommen was recast in Season 4 with actor Dean-Charles Chapman, who previously played Martyn Lannister in Season 3 - who was actually Tommen's first cousin. In an interview with the Game of Owns podcast two weeks after \"Oathkeeper\" aired, writer Bryan Cogman stated that Tommen was recast in Season 4 because he becomes the new king, which meant a lot more heavy acting rested on the character, so they wanted a more experienced actor. He also confirmed that they did not cast Dean-Charles Chapman as Tommen's first cousin Martyn Lannister in Season 3 to somehow set him up as the new, older Tommen (Martyn and Tommen are related, so logically, an older Tommen might resemble his older cousin). Rather, Chapman was cast simply to play Martyn in Season 3, and after Martyn was killed Chapman thought his time working on the TV series was over. Chapman was only called back to the TV series after the production team had decided to recast Tommen in Season 4 (it isn't clear if he had to audition or was hand-picked).:","When the royal party visits Winterfell, Tommen is matched against Bran Stark in a training fight with wooden swords and padding. He is repeatedly knocked into the mud and loses easily, but shows good sportsmanship about it and is happy that Bran was willing to spar with him so he could give it a try. Many characters believe he would be a better king than his brother."],"name":"Tommen Baratheon","description":"Throughout his life, it has been fundamentally clear that Tommen Baratheon's most prominent quality is that he is innocent. He has been the victim of his older brother Joffrey's intense cruelty, sadism and overindulgence by their mother, and this has set the two brothers apart quite considerably. Where Joffrey was arrogant, monstrous and a dolt, Tommen was humble, gentle, polite, compassionate, kind and sweet to a fault. Tommen was extremely emotional, crying helplessly when his sister Myrcella was sent to Dorne by Tyrion. He didn't stand up for himself when Joffrey callously mocked Tommen for crying, showing that at this point Tommen was underconfident, especially where Joffrey was concerned because Joffrey had tormented his little brother his entire life. Tommen is so kind that he heartily says he doesn't want Joffrey to kill Robb Stark in battle, despite the fact that officially the Starks and Lannisters were in a pitched war with one another.\n\nOne of the most unfortunate elements of Tommen's innocence and kindness is that he is considerably easy to manipulate. This set him apart from Joffrey, who was wilful and fearsome in his own way and had to be disciplined into following others. Both Tywin Lannister and the High Sparrow saw this weakness in Tommen, and exploited it. That being said, Tywin had the decency to say that he thought Tommen would be a much better ruler than his psychopathic older brother was. In this exact same conversation, Tommen is shown to be surprisingly intelligent and didn't require much prompting to figure out what made a good king, without taking it as a criticism as Joffrey would have done. Tommen's intelligence didn't necessarily make him perceptive of people manipulating him, though.\n\nTommen's compassion stretched to shocking degrees, since he apologized and even speculated that he'd hurt Margaery when she cried out during the consummation of their marriage. Even after the mass expansion of rumors (which of course are true) that Tommen and his siblings were products of incest between Cersei and Jaime, Tommen still loved his mother, but he did gain some independent emotions towards other people despite Cersei's best efforts. Tommen loved Margaery extremely deeply and expressed uncharacteristic anger and frustration when confronting the High Sparrow and demanding Margaery's release. Tommen's love for Margaery was so powerful that, when he saw the Great Sept of Baelor explode in a blaze of wildfire, and knew immediately that Margaery and her family who were inside it had been exterminated, he immediately removed his crown and silently, calmly, threw himself from the window to his death, showing that he couldn't envision life in a world without Margaery.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tommen_Baratheon"}}

As a result his hair becomes long and very unruly, signifying the mountain of anger and grief the young boy sits on due to the loss of his slain family members and followers."],"name":"Rickon Stark","description":"Rickon is the fifth child and youngest son of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard is the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell while Eddard holds the title of Lord of Winterfell. He is also the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon.\n\nRickon was born and raised at Winterfell. He has two older brothers, Robb and Bran, and two older sisters, Sansa and Arya. He also has an older \"bastard half-brother\", Jon Snow. He is six-years-old when his uncle, Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, mysteriously dies.\n\nRickon watches Bran's unsuccessful practice at archery and laughs when Bran misses and is outwitted by Arya; Rickon later helps Robb and Jon put the arrows back in their place. His brothers find a litter of direwolf pups in the Wolfswood and bring them back to Winterfell. Rickon adopts one of the pups and names him Shaggydog. He receives the visiting King Robert Baratheon with his family at Winterfell, standing close to his mother. His father accepts King Robert's offer to serve as the Hand of the King. Rickon's brother, Bran, is found severely injured at the base of a disused tower. Eddard travels south to the capital King's Landing, taking Arya and Sansa with him. Catelyn initially remains with Bran. She protects him from an assassination attempt and then discovers evidence implicating House Lannister in his injuries. She follows Eddard south to warn him in secret. Rickon's oldest brother, Robb, is left in charge of Winterfell.\n\nKing Robert dies following a hunting accident. His son Joffrey Baratheon claims the throne. Eddard challenges his legitimacy and is arrested for treason. Robb decides to ride against King Joffrey and wants to bid his younger brothers goodbye, but Rickon is nowhere to be found. Afterwards, Bran tries to reassure Rickon that Robb will return along with their parents, but Rickon wistfully replies, \"No, they won't.\"\n\nRickon sees his father in the crypts below Winterfell in a dream. He goes down to the crypts with Shaggydog to look for him. He meets Bran, who also had a dream about his father being there. When Bran emerges from the crypts, Maester Luwin tells him that their father has been killed.\n\nIn the great hall of Winterfell, Prince Bran Stark holds court for his people. He remains the acting Lord of Winterfell and wears a gorget embossed with the direwolf of House Stark about his neck while the House Tully pin fastens his doublet. Meanwhile, Rickon sits beside his older brother, shelling nuts loudly with a rock. A shepherd reports being unable to tend to his flock with his three sons fighting in the south. He reassures Bran of the loyalty of his sons but says that there are growing numbers of wolves in the north and that he cannot protect his sheep from them alone. Bran offers to assign two orphans from Winterfell\u2019s outlying Winterstown to aid him if he will give them room and board. The shepherd gratefully accepts, saying that his wife always wanted more children. When the shepherd leaves, Bran tells Rickon to stop. Having seen everyone, Bran tells Maester Luwin that he is going to go for a ride before dark and calls for Hodor.\n\nSer Rodrik Cassel enters the Great Hall calling for Bran. He reports that Torrhen\u2019s Square is under siege. Luwin is shocked, remarking that Torrhen\u2019s Square is just 14 leagues away and wonders how the Lannisters have reached so far north. The two brothers' Free Folk servant, Osha, listens intently as she lights candles at the back of the room. Ser Rodrik speculates that it could be a raiding party led by the Mountain or a group of sellswords. Bran says that they must help their bannermen. Rodrik nods in agreement and says that even with most of their forces fighting for Robb, he can gather 200 decent men. Luwin wonders if Rodrik needs to take so many, and Bran cautions that they must protect their bannermen if they expect their bannermen to protect them. Rodrik smiles at the boy\u2019s wisdom and Bran orders him to leave as soon as he has his men. Rodrik confidently says that it will not take long because southerners do not do well in their territory.\n\nThe attack is a feint orchestrated by Theon Greyjoy to lure away the garrison of Winterfell. He seizes the poorly defended castle and forces Bran to surrender to him by threatening the people. Rickon is distraught when Theon publicly executes Rodrik. Along with Bran, he tries to plead for Rodrik's life but to no avail. Osha manages to free Bran and Rickon and leads them out of the castle. They reach the shepherd's farm in the Winterstown. Rickon remembers that Bran sent Billy and Jack there and wants to approach them for food. Bran is cautious about putting them in danger if they are tracked. Bran's concern proves valid when Theon later reaches the farm but cannot find Bran or Rickon. He brutalizes the shepherd and then returns to Winterfell with the charred corpses of two boys, claiming that they are Bran and Rickon. The escapees actually back tracked through the stream and are hiding in the crypts at Winterfell. Luwin correctly deduces that the bodies must be the orphans from the farm. Rickon is described as being aged six by Yara Greyjoy when she learns of their deaths.\n\nA Bolton force led by Roose's bastard son, Ramsay Snow, besieges Winterfell, trapping Theon's meager Ironborn garrison. The Ironborn turn on Theon and accept Robb Stark's offer to spare their lives in return for surrendering. However, the House Bolton forces flay the Ironborn alive and sack Winterfell. Following the Sack of Winterfell, Rickon and his companions emerge from the crypt to discover Winterfell in ruins. They also find a dying Maester Luwin resting under the willow tree. While Bran and Rickon offer to bring medicine to treat Luwin's wounds, he declines their offer and tells them to gather all of their warm clothing and travel north to Castle Black, where they would be safe with their half-brother, Jon Snow. At Luwin's own request, Osha euthanizes the elderly maester after the boys leave with Hodor. Rickon then travels north, accompanied by his older brother, Bran; their guardian, Osha; Hodor; and their two direwolves.\n\nFollowing the Fall of Winterfell, Rickon, along with Bran, Osha, Hodor, and the direwolves, Summer and Shaggydog, travel north toward Castle Black, the headquarters of the Night\u2019s Watch. During the journey, the group encounters Jojen Reed and his sister, Meera Reed. During the first encounter between the two parties, Rickon and Hodor are out hunting, leaving Bran and Osha behind to guard the camp. The siblings are members of House Reed, a vassal house of House Stark, and had been searching for Bran and Rickon so that they can protect them. Bran also experiences strange dreams of seeing the world through the eyes of his wolf, Summer. Bran would later learn from Jojen that he is a Warg and has the ability to enter the minds of animals and control their actions. On one occasion, Rickon is present when Jojen descends into a fit due to the exertions of his vision.\n\nLater, Rickon and his companions reach The Gift, a region south of the Wall that is considered to be beyond the borders of the Seven Kingdoms. The Gift had been granted to the Night's Watch thousands of years ago by Brandon the Builder, from which the Watch draws support for its material needs. While the region is fertile, it has become uninhabited due to frequent Wildling attacks that forced the Smallfolk to migrate south over the centuries. When his brother, Bran, raises this controversial issue, which troubles Osha due to her Wildling ancestry, Rickon adds that he had heard tales about the Wildlings drinking blood.\n\nRickon and his companions take shelter at an abandoned mill to escape a thunderstorm. Later, the group notices a band of Wildlings chasing down a Northman. During the ensuing incident, Bran uses his Warg powers to Warg through Summer and Shaggydog to fight off the Wildlings. This party of Wildlings includes Jon Snow, who earlier had been taken captive by them. Using his Warg abilities, Bran helps Jon Snow escape from his captors and later return to the Night's Watch.\n\nFollowing the events of that night, Bran instructs Osha to bring Rickon to Last Hearth, the seat of House Umber, whose lord, Jon Umber, was a loyal bannerman of the Starks. This arrangement also suited Osha because she was unwilling to travel beyond the Wall with Bran due to the threat of the White Walkers. Rickon becomes upset, being separated from his brother and expresses his desire to accompany him on his journey. Bran tells him that if he or Robb do not return, Rickon needs to stay alive as the heir to Winterfell. Accompanied by his direwolf, Shaggydog, Rickon leaves with Osha as they head for the Last Hearth.\n\nIt is around this time that the Red Wedding takes place and several more members of Rickon's family are killed: his mother, Catelyn Stark; his brother, Robb Stark; his pregnant sister-in-law, Talisa; and her unborn child.\n\nAfter the Red Wedding, the Starks' former bannerman, Roose Bolton, who personally killed Robb, is appointed as the new Warden of the North. His bastard son, Ramsay Snow, has physically and psychologically tortured Theon Greyjoy, the Starks' former ward, turning him into a broken pet called \"Reek\", who reveals to Roose that he did not in fact kill Bran and Rickon, and that they may be with Jon Snow at the Wall. Roose sends his best hunter, Locke, to find Bran and Rickon, promising him a 1000 acres and a holdfast. Locke infiltrates the Night's Watch and eventually catches up with Bran at Craster's Keep, but Bran wargs into Hodor and kills Locke before he can interrogate him as to Rickon's whereabouts.\n\nAfter the Bolton army drives the remaining ironborn from the North and takes Winterfell, Roose Bolton asks Ramsay if he has heard anything from Locke. Ramsay informs him that he has not. Roose dismisses Locke's absence as unimportant, speculating that Bran and Rickon may already be dead anyway.\n\nRickon is still largely believed to have died along with Bran at the hands of Theon. When Sansa Stark returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay at the behest of Petyr Baelish, Ramsay initially forces Theon to keep up the charade and apologize to Sansa. Eventually, however, an irate Sansa forces Theon to finally admit that he did not kill her brothers. Stunned by this admission, her anger towards Theon cools but when she asks if he knows where they might have gone to, he breaks down and leaves the room, fearful of what Ramsay will do if and when he finds out what he just told her. However, Sansa appears to be left with a sense of renewed hope by the revelation that she still has surviving family left.\n\nRickon and Osha, having reached Last Hearth, are betrayed by Smalljon Umber after the Greatjon's passing and brought before Ramsay Bolton in order to form an alliance against Jon Snow and the Wildlings. After seeing Shaggydog's decapitated head as proof of the boy's identity, Ramsay sarcastically welcomes Rickon home, while Rickon shows visible signs of anger at Ramsay and his dead direwolf. Jon and Sansa later receive a letter from Ramsay that says he has Rickon in his dungeon and that his hounds will kill their \"wild little brother\" if Sansa is not returned. After hearing that Rickon is in danger, Jon and Sansa declare war on Ramsay.\n\nBefore they commence battle, the three of them have a parley where Ramsay asks Jon and Sansa if they will let Rickon die because they are too proud to surrender. When Sansa asks for proof that he actually has her brother, Smalljon pulls Shaggydog's head out of a sack and tosses it to the ground in front of them. Ramsay begins to repeat his terms if they wish to save Rickon but Sansa, having firsthand experience of Ramsay's \"mercy\", cuts him off and declares that he is going to die the next day.\n\nAs the two armies face each other on the battlefield, Rickon is brought forward. He lowers his head as Ramsay raises a dagger, but his captor simply cuts the ropes and asks if Rickon likes games. He tells the boy to run to his brother.  Rickon begins to walk but looks back to see Ramsay taunting him and starts running. Jon, knowing what Ramsay is plotting, begins riding towards Rickon who keeps running and is nearly hit as arrows land dangerously close. Just as Rickon is about to reach his brother, he is struck by an arrow and killed. This in turn provokes Jon and his army into attacking the Bolton forces while Rickon's body is hit with another volley of arrows. Though the battle proves costly to the Stark forces, they ultimately emerge victorious due to the arrival of a House Arryn cavalry force. Rickon is avenged when Smalljon is killed in battle by Tormund, and Ramsay is viciously beaten to a bloody pulp by Jon before being fed to his own hounds on Sansa's orders.\n\nAfter the battle, his corpse is brought to Winterfell and Jon orders him to be buried in the crypts next to his father.\n\nAfter returning to Winterfell, Arya is reunited with Sansa in the crypts, where Sansa tells her that Bran has returned but fails to mention Rickon, leading Arya to the distressing truth of Rickon's murder.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rickon_Stark"}}

She eventually earned the respect of the khal after explaining to him that she was Khal Drogo's wife. However, instead of escorting her to Meereen as per her request, Khal Moro's wife tells her that she must remain in the temple of Vaes Dothrak with the dosh khaleen for the rest of her life as she was a widow of a khal and a former khaleesi.\n\nDaenerys is welcomed to the Temple by the High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen, who admonishes her for not returning to the Temple immediately after Khal Drogo's death. She relates her own history as the wife of Khal Savo to connect with Daenerys, but warns her that because she violated tradition, it is up to the khals assembling for the Khalar vezhven to decide whether Daenerys will join their ranks.\n\nLater on, the High Priestess, clearly hoping that Daenerys will be allowed to stay with them, explains the politics of the dosh khaleen, and that some of them dislike Daenerys and her obvious Valyrian features, thinking that the Dothraki shouldn't breed with outsiders. The high priestess dismisses them, however, pointing out that the Dothraki have always interbred and taken outsiders as khaleesi. She points out a khaleen of Lhazareen origin to illustrate her point.\n\nDuring the khalar vezhven, the dosh khaleen bring Daenerys before the Khals to be judged, but it seems they are barred from attending themselves. The Mother of Dragons turns the tables on the khals and destroys the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, killing everyone inside. The dosh khaleen are amongst the crowd gathering to watch the conflagration, and when they see Daenerys emerge from the flames unburnt, they bow with the rest.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dosh_khaleen"}}

He is the eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly and Lady Melessa Tarly of Horn Hill and older brother of Dickon and Talla Tarly. He was forced to join the Night's Watch by his father under the threat of death, putting him out of the line of inheritance for House Tarly. Though he is overweight and not the bravest or the most skilled of men, traits looked down upon by his father, he is intelligent, well-educated, and insightful, his vast knowledge serving the Night's Watch well in their battles with the forces beyond the Wall.","Sam was a virgin when he left for the Wall, and is a bit despondent about the restriction that his vows forbid him from ever taking a wife in the future.","The trainees become men of the Night's Watch and Samwell is assigned to the stewards, specifically to the service of Maester Aemon. When Jon complains about his appointment as a steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, Sam points out that Mormont could be grooming him for command. Sam, feeling that his own gods have abandoned him, elects to say his oath to the Watch before a heart tree like Jon, hoping that the Old Gods would answer his prayers in a way that the Seven never did. After the ceremony, they are surprised when Ghost arrives, carrying a severed hand in his mouth.","They march to the Fist of the First Men and Sam is amazed at the ancient fortification. Sam assumes Jon's responsibilities as steward to the Lord Commander so that Jon can accompany Qhorin Halfhand scouting the Skirling Pass. The party does not return and are believed dead but Sam refuses to give up hope. He finds a cache of Dragonglass weapons buried at the Fist while working with Grenn and Edd. While collecting dung for fuel, the companions hear three horn blasts, signaling White Walkers. In a panic, they rush back to the Fist, but the slower Sam is left behind. As a blizzard rolls in, Sam takes shelter behind a rock. He watches as armed wights and White Walkers approach out of the snow. A White Walker mounted on a dead horse notices Sam, but appears to ignore him, ordering the wights towards the Fist.","Sam and Gilly stop to camp during their journey to the Wall, after having fled Craster's Keep. Sam shows Gilly the Dragonglass dagger he found at the Fist of the First Men and tells her about Castle Black. Gilly wonders if Sam can sing, the he tells her that he can't sing well. However, he knew one song and starts to sing it for Gilly and her baby.","The warg charges at Sam as he desperately attempts to load his crossbow, managing to do so and firing a bolt into the warg's head just before he reaches him. Sam then arrives atop the Wall to ask Jon for more men to defend the castle, and Jon tasks Sam with releasing Ghost from his pen to assist in the fighting. Once the battle was over, Sam returns to Gilly just like he promised and discovers Janos Slynt, who hid in fear during the entire battle.","At Castle Black, Sam attempts to comfort Gilly since she is worried of being sent away by Ser Alliser Thorne, which would most likely happen if Alliser is elected as the new Lord Commander. Sam reaffirms his promise that where ever Gilly and her baby go, he will go too in order to protect her. Later, Sam is present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee, and comforts Gilly, who cries in his shoulder.","Later, Sam apologizes for his father's actions but Gilly tells him that he does not need to. Unwilling to be separated from his family, Sam tells Gilly to pack up and leave together with Little Sam. Before leaving with his \"family\", Samwell steals Heartsbane.","Nevertheless, Sam still visits Jorah later that night, and explains his relationship with his father. He warns him not to scream during the operation, as doing so would lead to Sam's expulsion from the Citadel, and sets to work removing the infected skin.","Spoken about Samwell","Since in the books Jon has killed a wight but not any Others, Sam is the only known character that killed both an Other and a wight. He is also the one who discovered (by trial-and-error) that dragonglass is lethal to Others but ineffective against wights."],"name":"Samwell Tarly","description":"On the outside, Samwell Tarly may appear completely antithetical to the standards of his house - he is extremely timid, awkward, cowardly, nervous and easily frightened. When he was first tested in combat by Alliser Thorne, he didn't even pick up a weapon and allowed himself to be beaten, terrified, leading to the impression that Sam was worthless (an impression that Randyll Tarly had never allowed him to forget). However, in reality, Sam is actually a good man - he is extremely loyal to those who show him kindness, as evidenced by his almost brotherly relationship with Jon Snow, who remained his best friend throughout his time as a member of the Night's Watch. His loyalty to Jon would resonate from the moment that he volunteered to take Jon's vows with him. His extreme personal loyalty is potentially one of his best qualities, and ironically evidence that Sam aligns with the expectations of his house - after all, House Tarly breeds soldiers, and soldiers are supposed to be loyal.\n\nWhen he comes to Castle Black, it is quickly realised that he is not a great warrior, but Sam makes up for it considerably by being highly intelligent and observant. He shows himself to be so insightful that he assures Jon Snow that Lord Commander Mormont is seeking to groom him for command based on the duties that being a squire would entail. Sam has an encyclopaedic knowledge of Westerosi history, including the history of the Night's Watch, and is deeply fascinated by that history, to such an extent that his fellow sworn brothers often find him annoying for it. Even Jeor Mormont recognised Sam's intelligence and commended him for it. Those who could see through Sam's glutton and cowardice would realise how clever and valuable a person he was. Sam loves to read books at any given opportunity, so much that that the blind Maester Aemon easily deduced that Sam had come to see him, based on the fact that he had decided to enter the library at night to read.\n\nThroughout the series, Sam has shown himself to be capable of incredible bravery when he is pushed. While he cowered during the Battle on the Fist of the First Men, especially when he encountered a White Walker for the first time. One of his shining moments came when he faced off against another White Walker when it tried to attack Gilly and her son - Sam's extreme capacity for love towards Gilly compelled him to continue to attack the creature, even after it easily overpowered him already, and in spite of Sam being aware of the historical reputation of the White Walkers and how they had decimated the Rangers at the Fist of the First Men. Sam later proved himself to be gradually immune to the bullies that he had suffered most of his life, as evidenced by how he shamed Janos Slynt for his cowardice when the latter tried to shame him for loving Gilly. Sam's bravery wavered temporarily when he returned to Horn Hill and was chastised by his father Randyll again, so much that he was unable to speak throughout most of the conversation, but later on he openly defied his fearsome father by stealing the family heirloom Heartsbane and verbally daring Randyll to try and take it back (albeit, not to his face).\n\nSam was very good friends with Maester Aemon, so much that Sam gave the man's eulogy at his funeral and didn't condemn him for being a Targaryen. Before Aemon passed away, Sam showed reluctance to believe that he was dying, showing that he deeply cared about the old man.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samwell_Tarly"}}

He has five children by his late wife, Lady Whitehill: Karl, Ebbert, Torrhen, Gwyn, and Gryff. Karl died from Greyscale, Ebbert is studying at the Citadel, Torrhen serves Roose Bolton, Gwyn stays with him at Highpoint, and Gryff is at Harrenhal.\n\nLudd Whitehill and the men under his command aided their Bolton overlords in carrying out the Red Wedding - massacring men from other Northern houses during the slaughter - particularly those from House Forrester, their bitter rivals.\n\nFollowing Roose Bolton's ascension as Warden of the North, Ludd continued to serve faithfully by aiding Roose's bastard son, Ramsay Snow, in assuring the loyalty of the Forresters.\n\nLord Whitehill is first seen walking into the Forrester Great Hall, offering his condolences to Ethan Forrester regarding Gregor's death, and Rodrik's supposed demise. He then tells him that he was disappointed that he was not the one to kill them. Ethan can choose to remain calm, or be a little defensive. Ludd Whitehill will complain about how there is no bread and salt being given to the guests. Ludd will get angry that he is not getting any justice for his men whom Gared \"murdered\". Ethan can tell him that he did it out of self-defense and that he was protecting his family, which does not matter to Ludd. The Whitehills then leave.\n\nLater that week, Ethan either meets Ramsay and Ludd in the Great Hall, or by the gate. Either way, they end up meeting in the Great Hall regardless. Ramsay orders Lord Ethan to bend the knee to the Warden of the North, Roose Bolton. He can choose to kneel or refuse. Ramsay states he does not care about his loyalty and says that he will be taking their Ironwood. Ethan ends up proving a point and Ramsay settles for half of the Ironwood. He then tells Ethan that he will set up a garrison of twenty men in the walls of House Forrester. Lady Elissa refuses and then Ramsay snaps his finger and pronounces it already done. The men come inside the great hall as Ramsay asks Ludd who will lead the garrison. Ludd says that his son, Gryff, will lead the garrison, as he trusts him more than anyone else. Ramsay looks over to Ethan's younger brother, Ryon, who is hiding behind his mother.\n\nRamsay taunts Ryon to rile Ethan, who can step forward, ordering them to leave him be. Ramsay will then look at Ethan's sister, Talia. He grabs her and says that she's coming with him as his ward. Ethan can offer himself, grab her or just tell him to let her go once again. Ramsay lets Talia go and steps closer to Ethan, telling him he is bold (or brave\/wise) before thrusting a dagger into the Lord's throat in a split second. As the Forresters reel in shock, Ramsay explains that he does not want a bold lord. He then gives Ryon to the Whitehills to make sure the Forresters do not try anything.\n\nLudd is given Ryon as his captive in case the Forresters try to fight back against the Whitehill Garrison inside their walls, he stated that the Forresters brought this on themselves before he left the great hall.\n\nLudd bursts into Ironrath after receiving a raven from Elissa Forrester about letting Ryon attend the Funeral of Gregor and Ethan he will only let him attend if Rodrik kisses his ring to show him respect if he does Ryon attends the Funeral however if he does not he will be kept at Highpoint and his daughter Gwyn will attend the funeral instead, Ludd also announces that he is taking the other half of the Ironwood forrest before mockingly calling Rodrik \"Rodrik the Ruined\".\n\nLudd does not appear in this episode however when Rodrik Forrester and Gwyn Whitehill meet on mutual land she reveals that Ludd is just waiting for a reason to attack and that Rodrik has a traitor on his council.\n\nLudd sends a raven to Rodrik inviting him to Highpoint to discuss a truce. At Highpoint, however Ludd will judge Rodrik on whether or not he brought the Glenmore soldiers to protect him. Rodrik, Elissa, Gwyn, and Royland\/Duncan come to the table of House Whitehill and when Ludd finds out Rodrik had imprisoned his son Gryff he will bring Ryon into the room only to hold Ryon hostage, however he is convinced to make the trade of Gryff for Ryon which he agrees but they will make the trade on neutral soil he then tells Rodrik to \"get the fuck out of my halls\".\n\nIt is revealed by the traitor Royland\/Duncan that Ludd planned on ambushing and killing Rodrik when they made the trade, however Gryff and the Whitehill garrison are freed by the traitor, meaning House Forrester has lost their only hostages. Ludd then commands Gryff and his men to ambush and kill Asher Forrester and his hired pit fighters when they make land on Westeros, thanks to Lord Whitehill's orders, either Asher or Rodrik are killed during this ambush.\n\nLudd appears at Ironrath's front gates with the Whitehill army.\n\nIf Asher survived:\n\nLudd will try to persuade Asher to bend the knee as a bannerman to House Whitehill and to marry Gwyn to unite their houses. Asher can decide whether to insult Lord Whitehill, or to discuss House Forrester's fate with his family and advisors. A plan is then created, to assassinate Lord Whitehill. Asher can choose whether to ambush Ludd in their House, or whether to poison his drink, after tricking Lord Whitehill into believing he has won, setting the stage for the White Engagement. If poisoned, Ludd is killed at the cost of Lady Forrester's life. If ambushed, or if Asher unsuccessfully tried to make peace with the Whitehills after speaking with Gwyn, Ludd narrowly escapes the massacre in the great hall that claims the life of his son Gryff. Ludd rallies the Whitehill army and successfully seizes Ironrath in the ensuing battle.\n\nIf Rodrik survived:\n\nLudd Whitehill arrives to lay siege to Ironrath, taunting Rodrik with Asher's corpse (or with Asher's head on a pike if Rodrik antagonized Ludd), which Ludd forces Ryon to carry. Rodrik commands the defense of Ironrath and forms a plan to attack the Whitehills in their camp and kill Ludd in the hope this will destabilize the enemy. Rodrik infiltrates the Whitehill camp with Beshka and Asher's pit fighters where they spot Ludd ordering Gryff to kill Ryon if anything should happen to him. Rodrik can choose to try and kill Ludd as they planned or instead attempt to rescue Ryon from Gryff.\n\nIf Rodrik pursues Ludd, he corners him in an isolated corner of the camp where after slaying several of Ludd's soldiers, Rodrik and Ludd duel, where Ludd eventually takes a fatal wound. Ludd concedes that he under-estimated Rodrik but that House Forrester will still be wiped out regardless. Rodrik then decapitates Ludd.\n\nIf Rodrik chose to rescue Ryon instead, Ludd is seen marching into Ironrath where Lord Whitehill ignores him and leaves Rodrik to be killed by Whitehill soldiers.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ludd_Whitehill"}}

As she rises unharmed from the ashes of the pyre on the morning following the funeral, he climbs on her leg.\n\nViserion is not shown as much, until he is stolen by Xaro Xhoan Daxos, along with Drogon and Rhaegal. As Daenerys enters the House of the Undying to retrieve them, she evetually finds her three dragons chained. Pyat Pree attempts to chain her with magic claiming that her dragons make his magic strong, and that she makes them stronger, thus she will stay with them for an eternity.

After Daenerys frees the slaves of Yunkai, Viserion takes to the sky with his siblings at Daenerys's command; a show of both power and freedom.\n\nViserion is seen with his brother Rhaegal fighting over a dead lamb. Drogon, who is now visibly bigger than them, quickly takes the lamb as his brothers squeal for him to share. He sets the corpse down and the three begin to eat. In response to Drogon's killing of a three-year old girl, Daenerys leads Viserion and Rhaegal into the catacombs of Meereen, where she chains them up.\n\nDaenerys finally decides to reenter the catacombs in an attempt to regain control over her dragons. Rhaegal and Viserion, who have grown even larger during their time in captivity, immediately lash out and breathe fire at the sight of their mother who imprisoned them.\n\nSome time later, Daenerys, reeling over the death of Ser Barristan Selmy, arrests the leaders of Meereen's great families and brings them to meet Rhaegal and Viserion. Rhaegal roasts one of nobles and tucks in, sharing the meal with Viserion. Her point proven, Daenerys leaves, sarcastically saying that she doesn't want to overfeed the dragons.\n\nIn the Great Pyramid, Tyrion Lannister learns that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating anything ever since their mother had left. He decides to free them, knowing that they will be better off that way.\n\nAccompanied by Varys, Tyrion ventures alone into the catacombs and encounters Rhaegal and Viserion for the first time. Despite their initial hostility towards him, Tyrion remains calm, assuring them he is a friend of Daenerys and only wants to help. He manages to earn their trust and unshackle them, all the while telling them the story of how he wanted a dragon for his nameday, only to be disappointed by uproarious laughter from his family and the cold truth from his father. Once free, the dragons immediately depart while Tyrion quickly exits the catacombs with Varys.\n\nAfter Daenerys returns to Meereen and pits Drogon against the fleet assembled by Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis, Rhaegal and Viserion break out of the catacombs and join their mother and brother in destroying the the slavers' fleet with dragon fire, decisively breaking the Second Siege of Meereen. This defeat marks the end of the attempt to reintroduce slavery to Meereen.\n\nSome time later, Viserion and his brothers accompany their mother and her large army on a voyage to retake Westeros by soaring above the armada.\n\nViserion and his brothers fly ahead to investigate Dragonstone while their mother proceeds there by boat.\n\nUpon Jon Snow's arrival at Dragonstone, Drogon and Viserion fly overhead and visibly scare both him and Davos Seaworth. Tyrion then comments that he has not yet gotten used to them either.\n\nLater, Daenerys tells Jon that both Viserion and Rhaegal were named for her deceased brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar, respectively.\n\nViserion accompanies Daenerys, Rhaegal, and Drogon as they attempt to rescue Jon Snow from the White Walkers and the army of the dead at the Wight Hunt beyond the Wall. Viserion and his brothers burn and destroy many of the wights while Jon and his party mount Drogon with Daenerys. Not long after they arrive, however, the Night King is given a ice spear by another White Walker, and then hurls it at Viserion. The spear pierces the dragon's neck, fatally wounding him. With a screech of agony that mingles with his brothers' cries, the helpless dragon drops like stone, crashing through the frozen lake and sinking beneath the water.\n\nLater, Viserion's corpse is heaved up from the lake by the wights, and is reanimated by the Night King with a touch.\n\nWith Viserion as his mount, the Night King leads his army onto Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. There Viserion blasts the Wall with magical blue fire, eventually destroying the castle and allowing the army to pass into the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Viserion"}}

He tells Tyrion that there was no need to kill Elia because \"by herself she was nothing\" (in contrast to her children - as Rhaegar's blood heirs everyone knew they had to die for the war to end). The Mountain killed Elia simply because Tywin did not tell him to spare her. Tywin doubted if he had mentioned Elia at all, for he had many pressing concerns to worry about at that time, nor did he yet realize what kind of monster the Mountain was. On the other hand, he never punished Gregor for the rape and murder, because that would be an admission of indirect guilt on his part. This of course backfired: his inaction only served to convince the Martells that he was actively responsible and must have directly ordered Gregor to kill Elia, harming relations with the Martells far more than if he had simply admitted the truth. Tywin was also uncharacteristically defensive when Tyrion voiced his suspicion that he ordered Gregor to not only kill Elia, but rape her first, showing that even Tywin was disgusted by what Gregor did (but still did not punish him for it).","Confirmation of exactly what happened between Rhaegar and Lyanna will have to await the release of the future novels."],"name":"Elia Martell","description":"Princess Elia was the wife of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, who was also her distant cousin. They had two children; a daughter, Rhaenys, and a son, Aegon. She was born into House Martell in Dorne. She was the daughter of the ruling Princess of Dorne, the younger sister of Prince Doran Martell, who eventually inherited Dorne from their mother and became the ruler of Dorne, and the older sister of Prince Oberyn. Her marriage to Prince Rhaegar was arranged by King Aerys II Targaryen and considered an insult by Tywin Lannister, Aerys' Hand of the King, who had proposed his daughter Cersei as a bride for the Prince but was rejected. The marriage was one of the reasons Lord Tywin resigned his post as Hand. Like her younger brother, Elia was very popular among the Dornish people.\n\nWhen she was a child, Elia accompanied her mother and brother Oberyn on a visit to Casterly Rock. While there, Elia and Oberyn were eager to see the monster that had just been born. Cersei finally showed them the baby, but the Martell siblings were somewhat disappointed to see that Tyrion was just a baby, and somewhat disturbed by Cersei's already strong hatred of him.\n\nAccording to her family, Elia loved her husband Prince Rhaegar dearly. She bore him two children, Rhaenys and Aegon, to whom she was equally devoted; according to Oberyn, Elia took care of them from birth, rather than delegating the task to a wet nurse. Both pregnancies were very difficult, and each nearly killed Elia.\n\nWhen Robert's Rebellion erupted, Elia was retained in King's Landing by King Aerys to ensure the loyalty of House Martell during the conflict- a measure the Martells considered unnecessary, as they would always fight for whichever side Elia was on and had no intention of breaking their oaths of loyalty to the Targaryens. Ultimately Rhaegar was killed in personal combat with Robert Baratheon at the Battle of the Trident, leaving Elia a widow. A few weeks later during the Sack of King's Landing, Tywin Lannister's army betrayed the Targaryens and overran the city. Ser Gregor Clegane - known as \"The Mountain That Rides\" - burst into the royal chambers and before Elia's eyes, bashed her infant son's head against a wall, killing him instantly. Rhaneys was killed after she was found hiding under Rhaegar's bed. Covered in the blood and gore of her children, the Mountain proceeded to brutally rape Elia, and finally he killed her by cutting her in two with a sword.\n\nElia's death deeply alienated her family from the crown after Robert ascended the throne, and their hatred of the Lannisters now knew no bounds. Subsequently, they were never seen and rarely if ever mentioned at the royal court in King's Landing.\n\nElia is mentioned many times by her brother Oberyn in his conversations with various members of House Lannister. It is clear that Oberyn loved his older sister very much. When speaking to Tyrion, Oberyn expresses apparent anger that \"beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman\" despite Elia's love and loyalty for Rhaegar. Oberyn tells Cersei that his fifth daughter is named for her, and that he finds it difficult to interact with her as a result.\n\nAfter the assassination of King Joffrey, Tywin Lannister approaches Oberyn to determine if he had a hand in it, considering his hatred for House Lannister. Oberyn confirms that he blames Tywin for the deaths of Elia and her children, which Tywin cryptically suggests was all the Mountain's doing. He offers Oberyn an opportunity to confront the Mountain privately on the condition that he first preside as the third judge at Tyrion's court trial for Joffrey's murder, which Oberyn agrees to do.\n\nHowever, when Tyrion later demands a trial by combat, Oberyn volunteers to be Tyrion's champion after learning that the Mountain will be fighting for the Crown, hoping he will finally have vengeance for rape and murder of his sister.\n\nAs the two champions commence battle at the trial, Oberyn identifies himself to the Mountain as the brother of Elia and reminds his opponent of the crime he committed against House Martell, saying, \"You raped my sister, you murdered her, you killed her children.\" Despite wearing light armor and drinking before their fight, Oberyn initially gains the upper hand and proceeds to slowly cut down the Mountain all the while shouting in an ever louder voice, \"You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!\" Thinking his opponent to be fully incapacitated, Oberyn again demands the Mountain confess his crime and reveal who gave him the order, pointing accusingly at Tywin. However, in his hubris Oberyn is unexpectedly caught off guard when the Mountain suddenly trips him up. Berserk with fury at nearly being killed by his opponent, the Mountain pins Oberyn to the ground and proceeds to gouge out his eyeballs, making him scream in agony, as he roars for all to hear, \"Elia Martell! I killed her children! Then I raped her! Then I smashed her head...in like this!\" He then crushes Oberyn's skull, effectively confirming the long-standing rumor of arguably his most infamous war crime.\n\nDuring her coup d'etat in Dorne, Ellaria Sand cites the butchering of Elia, as well as Oberyn Martell, as one of the reasons she murders Prince Doran Martell.

Sam then tells Bran that he transcribed the diary of the High Septon who served at the time and discovered that he had Rhaegar's marriage to Elia Martell annulled, thus allowing him to marry Lyanna Stark in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Bran and Sam piece together that Jon, born Aegon Targaryen, is the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Elia_Martell"}}

He has a noticeable scar, gained at the siege of Pyke during the Greyjoy Rebellion.\n\nJory Cassel fought at the siege of Pyke alongside Jaime Lannister and Thoros of Myr who charged at the Greyjoy's with his burning sword.

He is with the group when they find the direwolf pups.\n\nJory accompanies Eddard south to King's Landing. During the dispute between Prince Joffrey Baratheon and Arya Stark, Jory reports that Arya has been found and taken before the king. Jory accompanies Eddard to the Crossroads Inn and listens as King Robert questions those involved. Queen Cersei convinces him to sentence Sansa's direwolf Lady to death despite her not being involved because Arya's wolf Nymeria cannot be found. Eddard asks Jory to look after Arya and Sansa while he attends to the execution.\n\nJory assists Eddard's investigation into Jon Arryn's final days, unsuccessfully asking for the assistance of Ser Hugh of the Vale , accompanying Eddard to Tobho Mott's smithy and later reminiscing over fighting in the Greyjoy Rebellion with Ser Jaime Lannister.\n\nJory accompanies Eddard to Petyr Baelish's brothel, still seeking illegitimate royal children. Jory is distracted by one of the whores while Eddard questions Mhaegen. On leaving, Lord Eddard has to break Jory's attention away from the woman he is staring at so they can leave. As they walk outside accompanied by two Stark guards, Heward and Wyl, they are confronted by Jaime Lannister. Jaime has heard of his brother Tyrion's arrest and demands his release. Lord Eddard says it was done by his orders and if Jaime kills him Tyrion will die. Jaime has brought many Lannister men-at-arms. Jory begins to let Jaime know that if he is to threaten Eddard again, there would certainly be a fight. However, Jamie interrupts Jory, and he orders his men-at-arms to leave Eddard Stark alive, but to kill his men. They easily kill Heward and Wyl with thrown spears. Jory attacks and kills two of Jaime's men before engaging Jaime himself. Jaime and Jory trap swords and Jaime stabs Jory through the left eye with a dirk during this event. Eddard, angered and stunned by Jory's death, exchanges blows with Jaime before a Lannister guardsman stabs him through the knee, ending the melee.\n\nWhen news about Jory and the others reaches Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy insists that Robb must make the Lannisters pay for their deaths, but Robb is hesitant about going to war.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jory_Cassel"}}

Slaves are typically held against their will. People can become slaves when they are captured as prisoners in war or raids, and some are even sold into slavery by their parents if they are poor and cannot afford them. Others are born into slavery, as the children of other slaves. Slavery has officially been outlawed in the continent of Westeros for thousands of years, but it is widespread throughout much of the eastern continent of Essos."],"name":"Slavery","description":"Slavery has been illegal in the Seven Kingdoms for thousands of years. Slavery is considered an abomination by both the Faith of the Seven and the worshipers of the Old Gods of the Forest. It was illegal in Westeros long before there even were \"Seven Kingdoms\", and the unification of the Seven Kingdoms in the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years ago only served to strengthen the enforcement of this prohibition.\n\nEven selling criminals to foreign slavers from Essos is considered a heinous crime. When Lord Jorah Mormont sold some poachers he caught on his lands to foreign slavers, he fled into exile to avoid execution by his liege Lord, Eddard Stark.\n\nThe ironborn push the limits of this with their practice of taking thralls, but they are technically not slaves, as even the ironborn raiders don't believe in \"slavery\" as such. Thralls are captured in raids, by \"paying the iron price\", but cannot be bought or sold like animals. The ironborn generally look down on selling slaves, as they still think of their captives as human beings, albeit on the bottom rung of society. Thralls are more like \"prisoners of war\" bound into forced servitude or labor. The children of thralls born on the Iron Islands are free men and are even considered ironborn if they are baptized under the faith of the Drowned God.\n\nWhile this hasn\u2019t been entirely confirmed, the Free Folk who live Beyond the Wall - who also descend from the First Men and worship the Old Gods - do not appear to practice slavery either.\n\nIn sharp contrast with Westeros, slavery is widespread throughout the continent of Essos, across the Narrow Sea. Large-scale chattel slavery has been practiced in Essos for thousands of years, since the dawn of recorded civilization. Indeed, it would be simpler to list the few places in Essos where slavery is not practiced: the Free City of Braavos, one or two of the other northern Free Cities such as Pentos which Braavos has managed to force to abolish slavery (albeit only nominally) and Lhazar. The slave trade is so pervasive in most of Essos that in many ways, slaves are used as a form of currency. Indeed, the slave trade is one of the pillars of the international economy in Essos.\n\nCultures from Essos frequently make slaving raids on the neighboring continent Sothoryos, to the south across the Summer Sea. Naath, a large island off the west coast of Sothoryos, is also a frequent target of slaver raids. The large island chain of the Summer Islands, to the west of Naath and mainland Sothoryos, is home to a powerful local civilization which abhors slavery. Summer Islanders have often warred with slavers in the past and their fleets drive slaver ships away from their waters. Slavers still make some opportunistic raids against Summer Islander holdings when they can, however, so it is not unusual to see Summer Islander slaves in Essos.\n\nThe ancient empires of the Valyrian Freehold and Ghiscari Empire practiced slavery since the beginning of their histories. The Ghiscari Empire was built on the backs of slaves, but it was conquered by the Valyrians and their dragons five thousand years ago. The Valyrian Freehold went on to conquer half of the known world, and their domains in Essos were fueled by enslaved peoples. Slaves worked the fields and died by the tens of thousands toiling in their mines. After the Doom of Valyria four hundred years ago, slavery continued in the surviving Valyrian colonies which became the Free Cities and Slaver\u2019s Bay.\n\nSlaver's Bay is the central hub of the international slave trade. Qarth is also involved in the slave trade, and Asshai seems to be as well. The cities of Slaver\u2019s Bay breed their local slave population, and also capture new slaves in raids on distant shores, such as the coasts of nearby Sothoryos (including the island of Naath). They trade their slaves to the southern Free Cities for food and finished goods, as well as to eastern locales such as Qarth and Asshai for more exotic products and spices.\n\nSlaver's Bay is also known for its fighting pits, where slaves are forced to fight to the death with each other or against wild animals.\n\nMany of the Free Cities also practice slavery, and the southern Free Cities in particular have large slave populations. Slavery is practiced in Volantis, Tyrosh, Lys, and Myr. As Volantis is most southeasterly of the Free Cities and the closest to Slaver's Bay, it is the main hub of the slave trade in that part of the continent. Due to the dangers of passing the ruins of Old Valyria, ships going to or from Slaver's Bay will usually stop at Volantis first. As a result, while Volantis is the most populous of the Free Cities, its population contains five slaves for every one free man. Lys, known for its pleasure houses, also holds a significant slave population.\n\nThe slave-masters in Volantis have a very organized system for their slaves, branding them with small tattoos on the left cheek of their faces that symbolize what tasks they are assigned to: flies for dung shovelers, hammers for builders, tears for whores, etc. Thus even freedmen remain marked. Slaves are also forbidden to touch nobles, under penalty of death.\n\nBraavos, the most powerful of the Free Cities, is the major exception; it was founded by slaves who fled Valyria, and to this day the Braavosi abhor slavery. Slaves brought to Braavos, such as on a slaver ship that was blown off course, will be forcibly freed if they land in Braavosi territory. Pentos was forced to nominally give up slavery in a treaty made with Braavos a century ago, but many of its \"servants\" are actually slaves in all but name. Some of these servants are even forced to wear heavy bronze collars.\n\nAs for the other northern Free Cities, Qohor and Norvos do practice slavery, but not nearly on the large scale in southern cities such as Lys or Myr. Lorath apparently doesn't practice slavery either.\n\nThe Free Cities frequently pay tribute to the Dothraki hordes in the form of slaves, as this is less destructive than suffering a raid.\n\nThe Dothraki practice slavery as well, even enslaving other defeated khalasars.\n\nThe Lhazareen are another exception that does not practice slavery: they are instead frequently the targets of slaving raids by the Dothraki. The Dothraki capture slaves from lands surrounding the Dothraki Sea, such as Lhazar and other lands much further afield (combined with the slave tributes from the Free Cities).\n\nThe Dothraki then give slaves to Slaver\u2019s Bay or Qarth in exchange for weapons, finished goods, and luxury items, completing the cycle. Theoretically, a slave born in Slaver\u2019s Bay could be traded to the Free Cities in exchange for weapons, then gifted as tribute to the Dothraki, and finally traded by the Dothraki back to Slaver\u2019s Bay, in exchange for the very finished weapons from the Free Cities that they were traded for in the first place.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Slavery"}}

She despises the concept of noble Houses in the continent of Westeros, believing it to be just another way to control others. She is a skilled fighter, preferring her swords over other weapons, and synchronizing her attacks with Asher's to defeat a large number of Lost Legion soldiers."],"name":"Beskha","description":"Beskha used to be a slave. At a very young age, she became a slave and was forced to kill other children for her master's amusement. At one point, she was forced to kill a good friend of hers who she used to play with. At some point in her life, she became a sellsword and befriended Asher Forrester, an exiled man who became her drinking, thieving and fighting companion four years prior to the events of the game.\n\nBeskha makes her first appearance in this episode. She and her sellsword friend, Asher, are in Yunkai three days after the city's liberation. They managed to capture Bezzaq, a former slave master with a bounty on his head, and are awaiting in an abandoned tavern to collect the reward. To their surprise, the Lost Legion arrive and their leader,Tazal, demands the captive. Tazal eventually murders Bezzaq and orders his men to kill Asher and Beskha, planning to blame them for the captive's death and claim the reward money for killing them. Asher and Beskha defeat Tazal's men and severely wounds or kills (player decision) Tazal himself. More Legion men show up and two of them overpower Asher while Beskha is busy fighting another. Asher's uncle, Malcolm Branfield, arrives and saves Asher and the three flee the tavern.\n\nBeskha stands in the background while Malcolm talks to Asher and informs him of the deaths of his father and brother(s) and that he is in Yunkai to take Asher back to Ironrath. Malcolm tells Asher that the only way to save house Forrester is if they return with an army of mercenaries to fight against the Whitehills. Asher and Beskha decide to call in a favor with an old acquaintance to secure a sellsword army in Meereen. Beskha, however seems troubled about going to Meereen, stating that she has unfinished business there, and refusing to talk about it. She dismisses her doubts and assures Asher it won't be a problem. While Beskha, Asher and Malcolm are leaving Yunkai, they encounter and dodge the Lost Legion once more.\n\nThe episode begins with Asher, Malcolm and Beskha continuing on their adventure to Meereen. They reach a dead end and they must find a way out. Malcolm demonstrates a strong knowledge of the area's geography and suggests a cave may be nearby, carved out by underground streams. Sure enough, Asher finds an opening and then the Lost Legion members catch up with them, the three of them escape into the tunnel. Asher looks for a way out while Malcolm and Beskha fight off the Lost Legion.\n\nDuring the three way battle between Asher's group, the Lost Legion and Drogon, Malcolm is attacked by two of the Lost Legion. One of them spears him in the leg but he is seemingly fine, while Beskha attempts to fend off Drogon. Asher is given the choice to save one of the two.\n\nDrogon burns Beskha, but she claims that she is fine. Malcolm climbs out of the cave while Asher aids Beskha. Drogon swoops in for another attack but the group escape.\n\nIn Meereen, Malcolm tells them that he will find Croft while Asher speaks with Beskha. He returns after their conversation and leads them to Croft, asking how well they know him. When they don't give a very comforting reply he insists that he thought they were allies. Asher says they are very good friends, but the first thing Croft does is punch him in the face. His men pin Asher against the wall and says he has to pay him back by losing an eye, tongue or arm. Once Asher makes his decision or tells Croft to fuck himself, Croft reveals that he is just kidding. Malcolm remarks that Croft has an odd sense of humour as the man reveals that one of Daenerys's dragons has gone missing.\n\nAsher reveals that he saw Drogon and can show Croft Beskha's burns as proof, then goes on to ask about recruiting some of his men. Croft schedules a time to speak with Daenerys about Drogon and saving House Forrester. Malcolm is last seen waiting outside of Daenerys's tent with Beskha and Croft.\n\nDrogon burns Malcolm along with the Lost Legion members, but Malcolm insists he is fine. Beskha climbs out of the cave while Asher aids his uncle. Drogon swoops in for another attack but the group escape.\n\nIn Meereen, Beskha tells them that she will find Croft while Asher speaks with Malcolm. Malcolm tells his nephew that choices define who he is, and that he should save family over friends. Asher can agree and apologise, or refuse to be lectured. Beskha returns after their conversation and leads them to Croft, while Malcolm asks how well they know him. When they don't give a very comforting reply he insists that he thought they were allies.

Croft schedules a time to speak with Daenerys about Drogon and saving House Forrester. Malcolm is last seen waiting outside of Daenerys's tent with Beskha and Croft.\n\nAsher speaks with Daenerys about Drogon. At first, she does not believe him and tells him that many others have claimed to see Drogon. Asher can show Beskha\/Malcolm's burns or Drogon's tooth. Asher tells her he needs an army for his family and she offers Asher to join Croft and his men to liberate Meereen. She demands that Malcolm stays with her. Beskha shows her anger about going back to Meereen. Croft warns Asher to not 'fuck this up' and leaves to announce two more have been added to the mission.\n\nLater on, Beskha and Croft are having a dispute when Beskha is getting drunk. Beskha punches him in the stomach and Croft tells Asher to deal with her. Beskha punches Asher and Asher can choose to fight back or refuse. After their dispute, she reveals that she was a slave and that her master was Dezhor zo Raza and that he made her slaughter other children as a child.\n\nA while after, Asher says goodbye to Malcolm and heads to the others to get ready to do the mission. Croft, Beskha and Asher take the east. The three of them walk through the alleyways of Meereen, remaining quiet and stealthy. Beskha sees a slave being beaten by two men. Once they run off, Beskha goes over to the slave and asks what they did to him. The slave says that the Mother of Dragons will come to liberate them. Beskha runs off and throws her master outside and points a sword at him. Croft tells her that she needs to keep him alive and be given a fair trial at the judgement of the Khaleesi. Asher can choose to kill the Master himself, stop Beskha from doing so or let Beskha kill her master.\n\nSoon after, Croft, Asher and Beskha plan out how to take out the guards. Beskha and Asher take the two in the front, they move forward and Asher can choose to use the crossbow or approach the guards and let Croft use the crossbow. They proceed and Asher and Beskha climb over a few rocks while Croft stands guard. Asher and Beskha then split up and go around the house to take out a few guards. Asher then can stick to Croft's plan or rush the few guards guarding the Harpy. Either way, the guards get alerted and try to light the torch. Asher must use his axe to stop the fuse but he must reclaim it once a guard climbs ontop of the Harpy to complete the lighting of the beacon. Asher breaks the right side of the Harpy off, with the guard falling off. The three rejoice as the job has finished.\n\nBeskha, Asher and Croft visited Daenerys Targaryen about the mission, the dragon queen asks if there was any problem, depending on whether Asher followed Croft's orders in whether she killed her slave master or not, Daenerys will or will not offer Asher gold. If Beskha killed Dezhor, and Asher revealed Beskha's slave history to Daenerys, she will express sympathies to Beskha but Beska will be disappointed at Asher for revealing her secret. However, Daenerys will still grant the chest of gold as payment in this case. If Daenerys' orders were ignored and Asher does not reveal Beska's history, they will get nothing.\n\nThe three left the tent and started to discuss about gathering sellswords in Meereen, now that it was free from slavery. Beskha warns Asher about Meereen's traditions, that killing is a sport to them and it's risky to find an army there, Asher insists so she follows him regardless.\n\nIn Meereen, Beskha reunited with The Beast and Amaya, they blame Beskha for escaping and abandoning the rest of the slaves. After arguing that the slaves are free and can join war, Asher volunteers to fight for sellswords, with Beskha and the rest watching fight Bloodsong from the fighting pits. It was a success and Asher managed to gather a few. They left Malcom behind and set out to Westeros on sea within a few weeks.\n\nBeskha and Asher made it to Westeros with a few sellswords and reunited with Rodrik, while preparing for war, Beskha, Amaya and some sellswords went beyond the gate before it was abruptly shut down by a Whitehill soldier. With Asher stuck inside, Beskha attempted to go back in but was proved impossible during Gryff's sudden ambush. After The Beast died and failed trying to open the gate, Asher and Rodrik tried to reopen it and was found out one of the Forresters had to stay behind for the other to pass through.\n\nIf Asher stays behind, Beskha begs him not to leave her, stating that she came to Ironrath for him and they should fight alongside each other, she reluctantly leaves and tells Asher to 'Rip their (the Whitehills') fucking hearts out'. If Rodrik stays behind, Beskha will watch Asher, upset for him that he had to leave his brother.\n\nShe then leaves on foot and set out for war with either Asher or Rodrik.\n\nIf Asher had perished during the Whitehill Ambush at the Harbor, Beskha is left bitter and saddened by his sacrifice and openly shows distrust towards Rodrik while mentioning that all Asher wanted was to return to Westeros. Beskha is also present during the Whitehills' arrival at Ironrath, where she and the rest of House Forrester witness Ryon hold Asher's severed head. During the raid on the Whitehills' encampment, Beskha and Rodrik cooperate in attempting to save Ryon from the Whitehills and are given the opportunity to slay either Lord Whitehill or Gryff. If Gryff was the intended target to kill, Beskha would openly show disdain for Rodrik's decision to lose the opportunity to kill Ludd and would help rescue Ryon from Gryff's captivity. However, if the player had chosen Ludd as the intended target, Beskha would only slaughter Lord Whitehill's men, while Rodrik would behead him. Regardless of the choice, Beskha fails to return to the agreed meeting point after the raid and is left on her own.\n\nIf Asher survived the ambush, Beskha helps take down some of the Whitehill soldiers they encountered at the harbour and afterwards expresses regret to Asher that she never had chance to get to know Rodrik. They travel back to Ironrath and Beskha watches as Asher is named the new Lord of House Forrester. Lord Whitehill arrives and offers to let the Forresters surrender and marry Asher to Gwyn, but Beskha advises Asher not to go through with it. When the Forresters decide to let Ludd think he's won and invite him into Ironrath so they can kill him, Lady Forrester argues against the Sentinel's suggestion that they ambush him using the pit fighters, so Beskha suggests poisoning his wine instead. It is up to the player whether or not they use Beskha's plan or the Sentinel's. After the decision is made, Asher requests that Beskha ensures Ryon's safety while the attempt on Ludd's life is made. Later, when Gwyn Whitehill arrives ahead of the rest of the Whitehills, Beskha says that it is a tactical decision on Ludd's part and tells Asher not to let Gwyn give him doubts about the plan. After Asher makes his decision on whether to carry on with the plan or call it off, the rest of the Whitehills arrive and Beskha seats herself opposite Ryon. When foulplay on the Forrester's part is exposed, she protects Ryon from a Whitehill soldier who attempts to kill him in retaliation and presumably escorts him safely out of Ironrath.\n\nBeskha makes one final appearance in the epilogue, where she is seen riding on horseback and escorting Ryon to safety, after Rodrik or Asher (severely wounded, but still alive) escaped from the Battle of Ironrath.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Beskha"}}

He accompanies Lorch in the attack on Yoren and his Night's Watch recruits. He knocks Arya Stark over when she runs to join the fight and takes Needle from her, and amused, says that he will pick his teeth with it. When the Lannister forces are victorious, Amory says that they will take the survivors back to Harrenhal.\n\nAs they are rounding up the survivors, Polliver approaches the injured boy Lommy, who has been shot with an arrow in his leg and says Polliver needs to carry him. Polliver seemingly obliges and offers a hand, but instead stabs the boy in the neck with Needle. Coughing up blood, Lommy chokes to death as Polliver returns to his fellow men-at-arms and mocks Lommy's request. Arya fools Lorch and his men into believing that Lommy was their target; the Royal bastard Gendry. Gendry is actually among the captives.\n\nLorch and his men deliver the prisoners to Ser Gregor Clegane at Harrenhal. Ser Gregor oversees the torture of the captives, killing several of them. After Arya sees Polliver beating up an old woman prisoner for asking him for a crust of bread, Arya adds Polliver's name to her nightly recitation of her enemies. Gendry is selected to be tortured while Polliver stands guard. Lord Tywin Lannister arrives during the torture and asks Gregor what is going on. Gregor says that they were not expecting Tywin for another day. Tywin asks why the prisoners are not in their cells. Gregor says that their cells are overflowing. Polliver interjects that the prisoners will not be there long. Tywin asks if they are so well manned that they can afford to discard able and skilled prisoners. Polliver catches Arya looking at Needle in his sword belt and orders her to kneel, calling her boy. Tywin immediately realizes that she is a girl and calls Polliver an idiot. He asks why she has dressed as a boy and she says that it was safer to travel. He says that she is smart and orders the prisoners be put to work. He says that Arya will be his new cupbearer.\n\nPolliver and four other kingsmen, including Lowell, are in a tavern, robbing the innkeeper of his supplies while they prepare to rape his daughter. The Hound and Arya Stark arrive. Polliver recognizes the Hound, but not Arya, and greets him warmly by having the innkeeper serve them ale. Polliver wonders what brings the Hound so far North, and the Hound wonders the same of him. Polliver says he is keeping the king's peace, but the Hound finds it needless as the war is over, and Polliver acknowledges Stannis's defeat at the Blackwater and Robb Stark's defeat at the Twins. Polliver states his regret being \"stuck with\" Gregor Clegane, calling it torture and saying that he feels like a carpenter making chairs, and it drains the fun right out of it, but that he shouldn't have mentioned that to Arya. The Hound says she is decent company, and Polliver tries to convince him to join them in raping, robbing and pillaging; they have free reign to do as they wish, since they are wearing the King's colors and no one is standing in his way as the war is over. Sandor's blunt response is \"fuck the King\". Offended, Polliver mentions the hearsay about the Hound running from the Battle of the Blackwater and how he originally didn't believe it. The Hound mocks the suggestion and demands a chicken. \n\nPolliver asks if he has money to pay for the chicken, in which the Hound asks if Polliver paid for it. Polliver chuckles and says no, but that they are the king's men, and again asks if he has money. The Hound says no but still demands the chicken. Polliver presents him a deal: one of their chickens in exchange for raping Arya, mentioning that his friend Lowell \"likes them a bit broken in.\" The Hound calls him a \"talker\", and that \"talkers make him thirsty\", and takes Polliver's drink and chugs it down. He says that they also make him hungry, and now demands two chickens.  Polliver glances back at his men-at-arms seriously, and tells the Hound that he doesn't understand the situation. The Hound says that he understands that if Polliver keeps talking, he will have to \"eat every chicken in the room.\" Polliver says that he lived his life for the king, and asks if he is willing to die for some chickens, but the Hound says \"someone is.\" The tension finally erupts into conflict, and Polliver is knocked out of the fight by the Hound who throws a table over him. After moments of brawl between the Hound and Polliver's men-at-arms, Polliver reaches for his sword but is stopped by the Hound, who steps on it and punches Polliver. The Hound then proceeds to fight with the kingsmen. Lowell attempts to fight back and swing his sword at the Hound, but the Hound instead parries Lowell's sword into the crotch of another soldier and injures him. The Hound then slaughters Lowell. Arya staggers one of the kingsmen by smashing a pot over his head and then kills him by slowly sinking his own longsword into him. When \u200BPolliver recovers and advances on the distracted Hound, Arya sneaks behind and slashes his hamstring, taking back her stolen sword Needle as he falls to his knees. Meanwhile, the Hound finishes the last alive soldier, inured in the crotch, by stabbing him in the chest.Arya stands over Polliver as he lays on his back and recreates Lommy's death scene, taunting him with the same words Polliver had used prior to killing Lommy: \"something wrong with your leg boy? Can you walk? I've got to carry you?\" She then repeats what he said to her when he stole Needle, \"fine little blade; maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.\" A look of recognition comes over Polliver's face as he finally remembers her and what she is referring to. She slowly sheaths Needle into his neck, completing Lommy's death scene down to the gurgling of arterial blood from Polliver's mouth. As she watches him choke on his own blood, a look of deep fascination and satisfaction resides on her face.\n\nAt a meeting of the Small Council, Varys informs the other members that The Hound has slaughtered five Lannister soldiers in the Riverlands.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Polliver"}}

In practice, of course, appointments or dismissals may have undesired political consequences which the King must consider.\n\nThe small council usually consists of seven non-hereditary positions (possibly to reflect the traditions of the Faith of the Seven). Long vacancies sometimes occur for one of these positions, i.e. during time of war, though this is considered undesirable.\n\nnull\n\nIf the Regent of an underage King does not already possess one of these positions, then they are included in the small council as the King's proxy.\n\nThe Commander of the City Watch is not, strictly speaking, a position in the small council, however the Commander frequently attends small council meetings to report on conditions in the capital city. Janos Slynt is given an official seat on the council as one of his rewards for the role he played in the betrayal and arrest of Eddard Stark, though he was subsequently removed by acting Hand Tyrion Lannister.\n\nThe council may on occasion extend invitations to other lords to occupy a seat on the council, despite there being no actual \"office\" for them to fill (serving as advisors who function as ministers without portfolio).\n\nThe positions and members of the King's small council under Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King, included:\n\nnull\n\nThe positions and members of the King's small council under Robert I are:\n\nnull\n\nTraditionally, as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Barristan Selmy would have had a seat on the small council. However, because Barristan had been a Kingsguard for Aerys Targaryen, Robert did not like to include him in discussions of strategy, so he usually held small council meetings without him. Barristan did not mind being left out, because he did not enjoy politics.\n\nKing Robert was notoriously uninterested in matters of governance, letting his small council run the realm while he ate, drank, hunted, and whored. Robert's own two brothers served on his small council, but they were also annoyed at how little he paid attention to the council. His youngest brother Renly, as well as Pycelle, lamented that he ignored all of Jon Arryn's sound financial advice, ultimately plunging the realm an astonishing 6 million Gold Dragons in great debt. According to Tywin Lannister, Robert appeared at only three small council meetings in his entire seventeen year reign (though he might not have been aware of Robert's appearance at some of the more recent council meetings with Eddard Stark).\n\nThe positions and members of the King's small council under Joffrey I are:\n\nnull\n\nJoffrey himself barely came to meetings of his own small council, unless it was insisted upon. His mother Cersei, as Queen Regent, typically took his place.\n\nWith the departure of Renly and Stannis Baratheon, who declared themselves rival claimants to the Iron Throne, the offices of Master of Laws and Master of Ships were left vacant. Cersei and Joffrey either could not find suitable candidates or simply didn't bother to appoint replacements.\n\nCersei and Joffrey's first edicts were to name Tywin Lannister as Hand of the King, to unlawfully dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from the Kingsguard, and to name Cersei's brother Jaime his replacement as Lord Commander. Tywin, however, did not assume the office for a full year because he was busy personally directing the war in the Riverlands . Because he could not go to the capital in person, Tywin sent Tyrion in his stead as acting Hand to try to rein in the royal court. Jaime did not arrive in the capital either, but was instead captured during the Battle of the Whispering Wood, after which he spent over a year as a prisoner of the Starks, and another year slowly making his way back to King's Landing through the devastated Riverlands. Jaime was technically Lord Commander during this time period but the position was functionally vacant. Moreover, Tyrion removed Pycelle from the council and imprisoned him in the dungeons of the Red Keep, after discovering that he was spying on him (albeit for Queen Regent Cersei, his own sister). Tyrion did not have the authority to appoint a new Grand Maester, so the position was also vacant for several months. Also, while the Commander of the City Guard is not a full member he usually sits at council meetings, but in disgust, Tyrion exiled Janos Slynt to the Wall. As Varys pointed out, for a time the \"small council\" was growing smaller by the day: four out of the seven main offices were vacant, the regent but not the king sat at most meetings, and the Hand was technically only an acting Hand.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Blackwater, Tywin Lannister re-assumed his duties as the Hand of the King, and sought to restore order to the council. Petyr Baelish was rewarded by being named Lord of Harrenhal, and departed for the Vale of Arryn to woo Lady Lysa Arryn into a marriage-alliance and secure the Vale's loyalty to the Iron Throne. Tyrion Lannister, who had been relieved of his position as acting Hand, was then promoted back to Master of Coin to fill Baelish's absence. Cersei secured Pycelle's release from the dungeons before the battle, and afterwards Tywin reinstated him to the council. As a display of his dominance, Tywin decided to start holding council meetings in the Tower of the Hand, adjacent to his own chambers. The composition of Joffrey's small council after the Battle of the Blackwater is:\n\nnull\n\nFollowing Joffrey's death, the composition of the small council remains mostly unchanged, except for Tyrion Lannister, who is imprisoned under charges of regicide. Tywin also offers a seat to Prince Oberyn Martell, the younger brother of Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne. Oberyn was not given a specific office, and was not interested in asking for one. Tommen's council members are:\n\nnull\n\nKing Tommen's small council changes dramatically after the trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister, in which Oberyn Martell fights as his champion and dies, and the assassination of Tywin Lannister, which also results in Tyrion Lannister and Varys fleeing the city.\n\nWith most positions vacant, Queen Regent Cersei seizes control over the council, and stacks it with sycophants. She pointedly leaves the position of Hand of the King vacant until Tommen is older and decides otherwise, while sitting in the Hand's chair at meetings. The office of Master of Laws, empty since Renly left the capital, is still left vacant. Cersei makes Mace Tyrell the new Master of Coin, in addition to his current post as Master of Ships. Controversially, Cersei makes the disgraced former maester Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers, over Pycelle's objections, a blunt and disproportionate reward for displaying loyalty to her. Cersei also makes up the new title \"Master of War\" - basically at whim, and despite the fact that it contradicts the title Protector of the Realm - and offers it to her uncle Kevan Lannister. Kevan, however, refuses to become her patsy and goes back to Casterly Rock. As Kevan points out, Cersei is only the Queen Mother now, and technically doesn't have the right to do any of this: she is no longer even the Queen Regent, because Tommen has come of legal age, marrying Margaery Tyrell. Jaime Lannister remains as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but he volunteered for a secret mission outside the capital to Dorne, which for the moment reduces the Small Council to only four people including Cersei herself. After all of this, Tommen's council members are:\n\nnull\n\nAfter Cersei's imprisonment by the Faith, Grand Maester Pycelle sends a raven to Casterly Rock asking for Kevan to take the role of Hand of the King, to which Kevan agrees, reorganizing the small council as such:\n\nnull\n\nIn order to seal the alliance with Dorne, Jaime Lannister promises to have Trystane Martell, Prince Doran's heir, appointed to his uncle's seat on the Council. However, since Trystane's murder, his seat is vacant once more. Moreover, Kevan Lannister removes Qyburn from Council, and he offers a seat to Lady Olenna Tyrell, to which she agrees. After all of this, Tommen's council members are:\n\nnull\n\nSince failed action against the Faith Militant, Lady Olenna Tyrell abandons King's Landing, at the instigation of her granddaughter. Currently, Tommen's council members are:\n\nnull\n\nAfter the Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor and extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing, Queen Mother Cersei Lannister crowns herself as the new Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Kevan Lannister and Mace Tyrell were killed in the explosion at the Sept along with many others, and Pycelle was assassinated by Qyburn and his little birds. Cersei's council members are:\n\nnull\n\nOnce Daenerys Targaryen decides to rule over Meereen as its Queen and enforce her abolition of slavery on Slaver's Bay, she assembles her own ad hoc small council, composed of advisors and representatives of the various factions under her rule:\n\nnull\n\nAfter being exposed as a spy, Jorah Mormont is exiled. Then, Daenerys decides to include a representative for each of the major factions in the population: the former slave masters and the former slaves. Hizdahr zo Loraq, a nobleman at her service, represents the former, while the latter are briefly represented by Mossador, one of the first Meereenese slaves to rise up for her:\n\nnull\n\nDuring the struggle against the Sons of the Harpy, Mossador is executed for killing a captive foe without a trial, and Barristan Selmy dies defending the Unsullied from an attack, in which Grey Worm sustains heavy injuries. In order to restore peace, Daenerys decides to reopen the fighting pits and marry Hizdahr zo Loraq. Eventually, Tyrion Lannister arrives from Westeros as Jorah's captive, and convinces the Queen to take him into her service. During the reopening of the Great Games at Daznak's Pit, the Sons of the Harpy lead a massacre that results in the death of many, including Hizdahr, and Daenerys herself escapes from Meereen on Drogon's back. In her absence, her followers decide that, while Jorah and Daario track her down, Tyrion will lead the council, as he is the only one with experience governing a city. As Commander of the Unsullied, Grey Worm will enforce the legitimacy of the council, and Missandei, who is Dany's closest confidant, will serve as the queen's voice. In addition, the former Master of Whisperers for the Iron Throne, Varys, joins the Council, bringing his spy network with him. Shortly before Daenerys' return, he temporarily leaves to gain alliances in Westeros. During this time, her council members are:\n\nnull\n\nAfter the Second Siege of Meereen, Daenerys' forces are joined by a fraction of the Iron Fleet led by Yara and Theon Greyjoy. Before she leaves Meereen with her army setting sail for Westeros, she asks Daario Naharis to stay in Meereen and she names Tyrion Lannister as Hand of the Queen. Varys returns to Meereen with allies from Dorne and House Tyrell. After all of this, Daenerys' council members are:\n\nnull\n\nDuring her Invasion of Westeros, Olenna, Elleria and Yara are all captured or killed by the Lannister\/Greyjoy alliance and Grey Worm and the Unsullied are stranded at Casterly Rock. However, Daenerys gains an alliance with the King in the North Jon Snow by permitting and aiding him in mining dragonglass to be turned into weapons against the White Walkers. After her enormous victory at the Battle of the Goldroad and the return of Jorah Mormont, Daenerys' council members are:\n\nnull\n\nJon eventually bent the knee to Daenerys after she saved him and his band Beyond the Wall, renouncing his title as King and accepting her offer of becoming Warden of the North. He and Davos still remain on her small council and they are currently traveling north to fight in the Great War.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the small council was the creation of King Aegon I, assembled to advise him and carry out policy. The small council is similar to a privy council in real-life medieval monarchies.\n\nIn the novels the council has an additional member: the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, who advises the King on various matters, particularly military ones. In the TV series, Barristan Selmy is never shown to be a member, the reason is explained in the Season 3 episode \"Kissed by Fire\". The reason for this was apparently due to the decision to have Barristan openly reveal his identity to Daenerys Targaryen as soon as he meets her. In the books, he initially hid his true identity, and told her his name was \"Arstan Whitebeard\". Because Barristan did attend small council meetings in the first novel, he knew that Jorah Mormont had been spying on Daenerys for Varys and King Robert. Because he was hiding his identity, however, he did not reveal this information as soon as he met Daenerys. In the TV version, Barristan does reveal his identity to Daenerys as soon as he meets her, probably because it is easy to make such a narrative deception in a book but this doesn't translate well into the visual medium of television. This of course means that if Barristan knew of Jorah's spying from attending small council meetings (in Season 1), there would be no reason for him not to reveal Jorah's spying to Daenerys when he first meets her at the beginning of Season 3. The simple answer the writers apparently settled on is to say that in the TV continuity, Barristan rarely attended small council meetings, because King Robert didn't like having a Targaryen loyalist around when he was discussing the realm's strategies (specifically, to send assassins to kill the Targaryen exiles - in the books, Barristan objected to this along with Ned Stark).\n\nIn the books, Jaime rarely attends the council by choice, since he is not interested in politics. The only time he attended the council (on the third novel), he soon got bored and his mind went elsewhere; before the meeting was over, he excused himself and walked away, leaving to his uncle to take care of whatever was discussed.\n\nThe Commander of the City Guard is not technically a member of the council but often sits in on its meetings to report on conditions in the capital city. Janos Slynt was rewarded with an official seat on the council for his betrayal of Ned Stark. However, Tywin Lannister considers this preposterous when he hears of it due to Janos' common-born status, indicating that the Commander of the City Guard is still not quite considered to be a full council member. Indeed, one of Tywin's specific instructions to Tyrion when he sent him to King's Landing as acting Hand was to remove Janos from the council. In the TV series, it is implied that Tyrion's disgust at Janos' involvement in the purge of Robert's bastard children was the sole reason that he removed Janos, and no specific mention is made of Tywin's instructions. In the books, Tyrion was also disgusted at Janos' actions, but this just gave him greater impetus to carry out his father's instructions (either way, Tyrion removes Janos in the TV series soon after he arrives in King's Landing; in the books as well, he didn't kick him out immediately simply because he had other matters to attend to first).\n\nApart from Tywin, Varys was appointed Master of Whisperers during Aerys Targaryen's reign. Grand Maester Pycelle held his position even before Aerys ascended to the throne. Wisdom Rossart, a pyromancer, was made Hand of the King, during the final weeks of Robert's Rebellion. Varys and Pycelle would retain their positions after Robert Baratheon ascended to the Iron Throne. The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) finally revealed who the other three members of the Mad King's small council were: Master of Coin Qarlton Chelsted, Master of Ships Lucerys Velaryon, and Master of Laws Symond Staunton. After Tywin resigned, Owen Merryweather served as Hand of the King for a few years - an amiable sycophant who failed to quickly respond to Robert's Rebellion when it started, for which he was stripped of his lands and titles and replaced by Jon Connington, until Aerys exiled him as well after his defeat at the Battle of the Bells. Aerys replaced him as Hand by promoting Chelsted to the office, but he later had Chelsted burned alive for refusing to go along with his Wildfire plot. Wisdom Rossart was then made hand for the better part of two weeks, before Jaime Lannister killed him and the Mad King during the Sack of King's Landing. It isn't known what happened to Lucerys Velaryon and Symond Staunton.\n\nAfter Robert became king, he pardoned Varys and allowed him to keep his position, as did Pycelle (who as a politically neutral maester was sworn to serve his castle's ruler, and was only doing his job when he stood by the Mad King - though he did later convince him to open the gates to Tywin's army). Barristan Selmy became the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and Jon Arryn became the new Hand of the King. Robert's brother Stannis was immediately named the new Master of Ships, but two other men initially served as Robert's Master of Coin and Master of Laws, whose identities have not yet been revealed. Renly was a child during the war, and he was only appointed Master of Laws some years later. Littlefinger also only became Master of Coin some years later, after his work as a customs officers at Gulltown increased port revenues tenfold and impressed Jon Arryn enough to take him to the royal court.\n\nAfter Tywin Lannister resumes his post as Hand of the King after the Battle of the Blackwater, his dismisses his daughter Cersei from the small council. Technically as Queen Regent she still has some right to be there, and in practice Tywin does have her physically sit at several important council meetings when he is explaining his plans. However, Tywin makes it clear that he will not let Cersei wield power under him, and when she is present at the council it is just so she can hear Tywin's plans so she can quietly obey them: he doesn't let her take a leading role in the council's discussions. Similarly, in the TV series, Cersei is still shown physically sitting at small council meetings, but for the most part she sits silently as her father leads the discussion.\n\nWhen Tywin resumes his position as Hand of the King, he also sets about reordering the rest of the small council, in particular, that Cersei and Joffrey embarrassingly left the positions of Master of Laws and Master of Ships vacant for over a year. He appoints his brother Kevan Lannister as the new Master of Laws, and Mace Tyrell as the new Master of Ships (as a reward for allying with House Lannister. In Season 5, Kevan reappears and states that he only just returned to the capital for Tywin's funeral, indicating that he was commanding Lannister armies in the field up until this point, and was never made Master of Laws in the TV version. Even after Cersei reorganizes the council upon her father's death, the office of Master of Laws remains vacant.\n\nThe Small Council was gutted after the loss in rapid succession of Littlefinger, and then Tyrion, Tywin, and Varys. Littlefinger returned to the Vale, while Tyrion was falsely arrested for allegedly poisoning Joffrey; Tyrion later escaped and fled Westeros, but not before murdering his own father Tywin; for his role in helping Tyrion escape, Varys also fled into hiding. Of the original Small Council when Joffrey seized power, only Pycelle still remained.\n\nIn Season 5's \"The House of Black and White\", Cersei restaffs the Small Council by stacking it with sycophants, to make its offices just puppets while she functionally rules as the actual monarch in all but name. In the fourth novel, Cersei's corresponding takeover of the Small Council and stacking it with incompetent cronies was a major running plotline affecting politics in the capital city. The TV version significantly condenses this, though keeping the general thematic points the same:\n\nIn the novels, Cersei appointed Harys Swyft (Kevan's own father-in-law) as the new Hand of the King, Orton Merryweather as Master of Laws, Gyles Rosby as Master of Coin, and Aurane Waters as Master of Ships. She appointed Qyburn as the new Master of Whisperers (spymaster) in both the books and TV series. Mace Tyrell was the Master of Ships under Tywin (because after the Royal Fleet got destroyed at the Battle of the Blackwater they need the Tyrell's large fleet), but Cersei grew so distrustful of the Tyrells that she removed him from the office and sent him to besiege Stannis's remaining garrison at Storm's End. Since the council practically consisted of Cersei and her henchmen, it was publicly ridiculed as \"the smallest council\". Littlefinger scornfully refers to the three new members in the council as \"the deaf, the dim, and the blind\".\n\nGiven that these characters were not introduced in the TV series before and the audience wouldn't be familiar with them, Cersei's reshuffling of the Small Council in the TV version is condensed: Cersei isn't bothering to name a new Hand of the King at all, shockingly leaving the office vacant while functioning ruling over the council. In the novels, Cersei is technically still Tommen's Regent - but in the TV version, Cersei has lost the regency: Kevan specifically says that she is only the Queen Mother, and makes no mention of being a regent. A Queen Mother has no right to sit on the council if not a regent (though a king can in theory invite any advisors he wants onto his council - but Tommen isn't even present). Mace Tyrell is retained, and simply made both Master of Ships and Master of Coin. Qyburn is the new Master of Whisperers, and Pycelle remains Grand Maester. As Kevan was apparently going to point out, as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, her brother Jaime is also supposed to be a member of the Small Council, but he has left the capital, though as it turns out, he volunteered to leave, to deal with events outside the city, rather than be at the company of \"the lickspittles and fools who surrounded Cersei\", as he disdainfully regarded the council.\n\nIn the TV version, Cersei offers to make her uncle Kevan Lannister his Master of War - even though there is no such thing as a \"Master of War\". The crown's armies are commanded by the \"Protector of the Realm\" (usually the king, unless he is underaged, incapacitated or chooses to bestow the title to a more competent figure), who in turn commands the four Wardens. This reflects a more complex development in the novels, in which Cersei basically starts making up titles on the Small Council, at her whim (which she technically doesn't have the right to do either). In an act of petty resentment, she comes to loathe the idea of anyone else calling himself \"master\" in his title on the Small Council, feeling this means a loss of control. Therefore, she picks new names based on a few titles from the Free Cities: the Master of Coin is renamed the \"Lord Treasurer\", the Master of Ships is renamed the \"Grand Admiral\", and the Master of Laws is renamed the \"Justiciar\". She offers Kevan to become the new Hand of the King, but he bluntly refuses her after she refuses to give up the regency, openly telling her that she failed as a mother to raise Joffrey, and demands that she yield over custody of Tommen. She refuses, and he returns to Casterly Rock. Essentially the same plot development happens in the TV version, though significantly condensing these characters and plotlines.\n\nFollowing Cersei's arrest, she is stripped of all power, and all her henchmen either flee, removed from their offices or arrested. Kevan takes upon himself to amend the damages his niece caused during her reign, and forms a council of capable people, with consideration of the political aspects:\n\nnull\n\nThe fact that three seats are taken by House Tyrell and its bannermen worries Kevan, but he knows it is necessary to appease the Lannisters' main allies, something Cersei failed to understand. In spite of this potential problem, Kevan and his small council are so effective that Varys feels the need to personally assassinate both Kevan and Pycelle, since they have already started to make headway in reversing the damage Cersei had done to the Realm.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Small_Council"}}

Despite his low birth Gared had always aspired to one day be come a warrior himself. Gared then got his chance to follow this dream with the help of his uncle Duncan, who had risen from lowborn origins to become Castellan of Ironrath and a close friend to Lord Forrester. Gared then found work in house Forrester where he had started out as a stable boy and where had befriended Bowen a squire to Norren one of lord gregor's man at arms. Despite all of his origins Gared had eventually rose up and became Gregor's squire and served him faithfully. Gared has served Lord Forrester throughout the long months in King Robb\u2019s army, and is ready to be a warrior in his own right.\n\nGared is present at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, also known as the Red Wedding. Gared enjoys as one of the Forrester men, Norren, tells stories about the Battle of the Whispering Wood and the capture of Jaime Lannister. Fellow squire Bowen reminds him that Lord Forrester's sword needs cleaning. Finally, Lord Gregor emerges from his tent and joins the conversation between the Forrester men. Bowen notices he is holding a cup and notifies Gared should get him some wine. After this, Lord Forrester asks to speak with him. Gared is promoted and is told that he will fight tomorrow, but that for now he needs to go and find his first-born son Rodrik Forrester. Gared and Bowen make their way to get wine and encounter some of Walder Frey's men.\n\nAfter listening to the soldier at the pump making comments about the wedding, Gared notices that there is something going on. He notices the Frey men's crossbows by their seats, the Frey men in a tent loading them, and finally The Rains of Castamere playing. Panicking, Gared is given choices to make Bowen hurry which in turn alerts the soldiers to his knowledge.\n\nAfter this, Gared is given a choice; to run from Bowen and save Lord Forrester or to save Bowen. If Gared runs to Lord Forrester, Bowen is stabbed in the neck by a Frey soldier. He is then forced to dodge swords and maces, crawls under a burning cart and wrestles with a soldier. He gets to Rodrik but is only able to watch as he is stabbed and killed by Frey soldiers. Once Gared gets to Lord Forrester he is asked where Rodrik is, and Norren asks him where Bowen is. If Gared chooses to save Bowen he pulls him away from the soldiers and the two of them run away. Gared goes through the same sequence as before and still watches Rodrik die.\n\nGared then finds Lord Forrester and if Bowen lives he can be seen stabbing a soldier in the back and also advancing upon the group of soldiers along with Norren, Lord Forrester and Gared. The three\/four attempt to fight the group but Gared is knocked down by a soldier, after which Lord Forrester saves him. Lord Forrester is then hit by a crossbow bolt in the chest, and he and Gared are instructed to run by Norren.\n\nOnce Gared and Lord Forrester make it to the edge of the Frey's camp Lord Forrester falls to the ground due to his wounds. Gared is commanded to journey on with the Forrester greatsword and return it to his son, Ethan Forrester who will be the new Lord of Ironrath. Gared accepts, but before he leaves Lord Forrester also asks him to tell his Uncle Duncan Tuttle the Castellan of Ironrath that \"The North Grove must not be lost.\" and to tell nobody else. Gared once again accepts.\n\nGared is then seen wandering down the Kingsroad, presumably on his way to Ironrath. He sees blood on the road and is given the opportunity to examine, as well as being able to examine other objects such as a dead pig and an overturned cart. Gared then sees three soldiers harassing his father, who is tied to a post. The lead soldier is heard saying \"Roose Bolton shall have his bacon.\" They see Gared and instruct him to \"move along\" as there is \"nothing to see here.\" However, Gared sees his father and advances toward them. At this point he is given the chance to move to his father or draw his sword. Both choices end in the same way, Gared fights the three men. At first, Britt, a Whitehill soldier, takes Lord Forrester's sword from Gared, and Gared is made to choose between two weapons; a pitchfork or an axe. After choosing one Gared either impales the pitchfork in a Bolton soldiers' neck or hacks into his neck with an axe. He then fights for the greatsword back, is stabbed in the leg by the Britt and dodges attacks from another Whitehill soldier and is given the choice to show him mercy or kill him. As the choices suggest, the Whitehill soldier either walks away or is killed by Gared. Britt escapes on his horse regardless of the choices made.\n\nGared then arrives at Ironrath, the gates are opened at his arrival and he is met by Ortengryn. Gared falls to the floor and is escorted inside by the Maester. The wound on his leg is treated by pouring maggots into the infected wound whilst Gared holds it open. Gared is then told to walk around to let the blood circulate. After walking around the Great Hall of Ironrath, Gared is able to speak to Maester Ortengryn. He hands the Maester Lord Forrester's sword just as Lady Elissa Forrester enters the room accompanied by Talia Forrester, who is sent to bed by the Maester. She asks what Lord Forrester was like when he died, and if he had any last words. She appears upset if you tell her that he saved your life, replying \"And yet he could not saves Rodrik's.\" She also asks if her husband had any last words, at this point you are given the choice to stay silent, say that he said he loved her or tell her about the North Grove and break your promise to Lord Forrester. Duncan Tuttle and Ser Royland Degore enter, and Maester Ortengryn leaves accompanied by Lady Forrester. The two men are bickering about what should happen with Gared. Ser Royland wants to fight the Whitehill's when they come for justice but Tuttle believes it to be too dangerous, and so for the safety of the house suggests that Gared go to the Wall and join the Night's Watch. Regardless of Gared's choices here, he is forced to go to The Wall. Duncan tells Gared that he can have his horse, and the two walk out of the Great Hall together.\n\nAs they approach the stable, Gared informs Duncan of Lord Forrester's final words. Duncan questions Gared as to whether he held true to the promise he made to Lord Forrester, after answering Duncan tells Gared that he may require his help soon. He also states that Gared should \"Try to become a ranger, it'll help.\" Gared then makes his way out of Ironrath on the horse, at which point Talia runs up to him and hands him her necklace. Silently, Gared accepts, and then rides away.\n\nA while after this, Gared is seen walking through the Wolfswood with his horse at his side. He hears screaming and his horse, scared, runs away and neighs. Gared runs to investigate and hides behind a tree, seeing Ramsay Snow and a company of Bolton soldiers with a flayed man. Gared hides behind a tree while he observes Ramsay torture the man. After Ramsay is done, Gared breaks a twig, making a sound. Ramsay notices, and one of the Bolton soldiers is ordered over to investigate, and Gared either runs or stays still, if he stays still then after a brief moment the soldier sent to investigate the sound of the broken twig is called back by Ramsay and the group depart on horseback. \u200BGared then approaches the man the group left behind, to discover he has been flayed alive, and has died from his wounds. The shocked look on Gared's face is the last we see of him in the episode. If Gared runs, he runs without getting caught and won't investigate the flayed man. Gared fleeing is the last we see him in the episode.\n\nGared arrives at Castle Black and meets Frostfinger, who questions him as to who he is and why he arrived. Frostfinger reveals he received a letter from Duncan, asking him to make Gared a ranger. Frostfinger makes it clear that Gared has to earn the chance to be a ranger and won't be bestowed it \"like a knighthood\". Gared meets two of his new brothers-in-training, Finn and Cotter. Finn was sent to the Wall for sleeping with a noble woman and killing her fiancé with his own dagger, which is now a prized possession of his. Cotter stole potatoes to feed his sister.\n\nCotter and Finn argue between themselves which results in Cotter pick pocketing Finn's dagger. Gared is put through training, hoping to become a ranger, having to prove himself by firing a crossbow, sword fighting and lifting barrels. Finn mocks and attempts to sabotage Gared during these trials. Once Gared is finished Finn realizes his knife is missing and a fight breaks out. Frostfinger breaks up the fight and intends to punish those responsible. However, Jon Snow arrives, needing men to patrol the top of the Wall with him and Frostfinger sends Gared with him.\n\nGared and Jon Snow talk while on top of the Wall, Gared can explain what happened to Jon's half-brother, Robb Stark, at the Red Wedding and Jon will tell Gared about his own experience in joining the Night's Watch and give him some advice in how to fit in. He also asks why Gared wants to be a ranger.\n\nAt the wall, Gared is practicing his sword skills and then Frostfinger calls a meeting. He tells them they will now take their vows while Finn gets angry at Gared for 'stealing his knife'. They later on go to say their vows at the Weirwood tree. While on the way, Jon tells him that he must be brothers with Finn even though he may be a jerk. Gared approaches him and can end up making things (somewhat) right with each other. They reach the tree and say their vows.\n\nOnce Gared returns, he is surprised to hear he has a visitor at Castle Black. It is his uncle, Duncan. Duncan and Gared discuss House Forrester's status, and move on to speak about the North Grove. Duncan requests that Gared abandon the Night's Watch the first chance he gets beyond the Wall. Duncan leaves while Gared walks over to the elevator that leads atop the wall and Finn and Cotter ask about of what his uncle was here for. Gared refuses to tell them and they enter the elevator.\n\nLater on, Gared is shocked once he sees Britt Warrick arriving at the wall. The two have a brief verbal joust before Frostfinger intervenes and asks what the problem is with the two of them and manages to get the pair to disperse.\n\nJon tells Gared about going to Craster's Keep. He warns him that Britt is also going with. Gared walks over to Cotter and Finn and talks about going to Craster's. Cotter reveals that he took the North Grove map from him, while Finn runs off because of his disbelief of the North Grove, Cotter reveals that he is a wildling and he was going home no matter what. Finn speaks with Gared atop the Wall about Cotter.\n\nFinn leaves while Britt arrives. He attacks Gared, after fighting with Britt - Gared gets the choice to 'leave him', 'make him suffer', or to kick him off the Wall. Either way ends up Britt dying at the end. After Britt has perished, Gared turns around, and he notices Finn, who witnessed the events that just transpired and runs off.\n\nAt the Wall Britt's corpse is burned and Gared has been chained by Frostfinger. Jon Snow, about to leave for Craster's Keep, pulls Gared aside and asks why he did it and is disappointed that Gared killed Britt. Finn inform Frostfinger that Gared attacked Britt, or that he was defending himself, depending on Gared's relationship with Finn. When Frostfinger interrogates him however he will still imprison him telling him he will be beheaded in the morning.\n\nLater that night, Gared escapes with the help of Cotter and decides to desert the Wall. Gared also chooses whether to bring along Finn who fears for his safety being associated with Gared. Finn may not appear however, if the player was not on good terms with him.\n\nBeyond the wall the group come along across of female wildlings. Cotter believes he can deal with them as he is a wildling but no matter what Gared does Cotter will be stabbed in the shoulder. Gared manages to fight the wildlings and the group continue on their journey.\n\nGared and the group rest at what Cotter claims is a deserted wildling camp. While looking for water Gared comes across a particularly young wildling. She raises a spear to Gared, before Cotter interrupts revealing she is his sister, Sylvi and that she can take them to the North Grove.\n\nIn the Northern Forest, Gared is tending to a campfire while Sylvi talks about how they will go join the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, and not to the North Grove. Finn will be present in the conversation if he came with you in Episode 4. Cotter talks about how Gared needs to go North but Sylvi refuses to go there. Finn also says that Gared shouldn't go to the North Grove cause he doesn't believe in it and leaves the conversation angry. Gared can go talk to him after and tell him to go to the fire and says, \"I better get warm before I die.\" Gared goes over to Sylvi and they spot a rabbit. Gared will be prompted to shoot the rabbit, there are two, giving the player two chances. The two of them are talking about who they've lost, and then Cotter (and Finn if he went with them) yell for help, frightened by the Wights of the female wildlings they fought earlier that have come.\n\nThe group fight against the Wights, Cotter is unable to fight due to his arm. Gared says that they can't die, and Finn claims that anything can be killed, and attacks the Wight. The Wight ends up stabbing Finn in the stomach and he falls against the tree. If Finn isn't there, Gared stabs the Wight in the head but it isn't enough and Cotter finishes the job by chopping the head off. Gared cries, \"Why won't they die?\" And Sylvi tells him that he must use fire, Gared kicks one wight into the fire and grabs a torch to hit the other ones. Once they deal with the Wights, if Finn is with you, he will be dead from the spear in his stomach, if not, the three of them make for the North Grove while more Wights run towards them. Gared, Cotter and Sylvi are not seen for the rest of the episode.\n\nGared, Sylvi and a wounded Cotter are moving closer towards the North Grove. While trying to ease Cotter's pain, Gared discovers a deer corpse covered in fresh blood. Gared also notices claw marks on a nearby tree. Suddenly the group is pursued by the animal responsible, a large polar bear. Gared, Sylvi, and Cotter flee across a frozen lake. Gared stays behind to fight the polar bear, giving time for Sylvi and Cotter to escape. The polar bear disarms Gared, and he is unable to retrieve his sword. Unarmed, It forces Gared to retreat back to Sylvi and Cotter. The polar bear pursues, but its massive weight breaks through ice. Both the polar bear and Gared fall into the water. Gared surfaces from the water and is rescued by Sylvi and Cotter. The polar bear chases the group, forcing the three to flee to an unknown camp for refuge. When they arrive, one of the locals reveals himself to be a warg, who then leaves the body of the polar bear pursuing them. Immediately, the animal gives up chase. Gared, Sylvi and Cotter are then captured by the camp's warriors. They are sent to speak with their leader, a woman named Elsera. After Gared reveals he was sent by House Forrester, she tells the three that they are in the North Grove. Elsera protects the grove along with her brother Josera; the warg who followed the group in the guise of a polar bear. However, Elsera notices the grove will soon be attacked by wights. Gared goes with Elsera, Cotter is moved to another part of the encampment to rest, and Sylvi is bound with rope and is watched.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gared_Tuttle"}}

It's meant to remind him of his servitude, like the collar of a dog. He can't remove it, even to sleep. Each link signifies mastery, or at least what those withered old men in The Citadel consider mastery, of a different area of study: gold for the study of sums and accounts, silver for healing, iron for war, black iron for ravenry, lead for poisons and Valyrian steel for the... higher mysteries. Only one maester in a hundred forges such a link, only one maester in a hundred has a sense the gods gave a goat.\n\nThough I admit that no one had performed true magic in centuries. We sit in a room mumbling over a candle of dragonglass, trying to make it catch fire. After a sleepless night of failure, we are supposed to admit to our own limitations. To win the link, we are supposed to lose their curiosity. I never did. In time, the archmaesters decided more links were useless to a man who wouldn't be chained by them. They took my chain and expelled me from the Citadel. Their loss.\n\nThe chain as a whole is supposed to signify the realm. One cannot have only lords or only knights, one needs farmers, smiths, merchants, shepherds and the like. Like a chain forged of many different metals. An obvious and trivial point, disguised with pomposity, much like the maesters themselves. They study without learning and proudly pass down the same knowledge that was passed down to them, with no addition. Perhaps such is to be expected when one considers the kinds of men who become maesters. The youngest sons of noble families, dutiful and timid, raised in the shadow of their older brothers; or bastards and peasant boys whose minds are easily satisfied by the knowledge of their next meal.\n\nBecause bold men will not be chained. They dare to ask questions that the maesters fear to answer. They will look at a living man and ask: \"How?\" ... They will look at the dead and ask: \"What if?\".\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Maester%27s_Chain"}}

Jon Arryn was played in these scenes by John Standing.","Even in the books, Pycelle didn't know who actually poisoned Jon Arryn, but it was convenient for Pycelle that someone else poisoned him before he had to deal with it."],"name":"Jon Arryn","description":"Jon Arryn was the Lord of the Eyrie and the head of House Arryn, one of the Great Houses of Westeros. Jon was the Warden of the East and Defender of the Vale. He was a respected nobleman and both Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon were fostered by him during their adolescence. The Mad King condoned the alleged kidnapping of Eddard's sister, Lyanna, who was also Robert's betrothed, and demanded that Eddard and Robert, still in the Vale, be turned over to the King's justice. Instead, Lord Arryn rebelled, calling his banners to war. House Stark and House Baratheon followed suit. The rebels forged an alliance with House Tully through marriage, with Eddard married to Catelyn Tully and the then-elderly Jon to the young Lysa Tully. After the rebel victory in the war, Robert became King and appointed Jon as his Hand. Jon served the realm well for many years as Hand of the King. Indeed, Jon Arryn was essentially the man really holding the realm together for the next seventeen years, while Robert drank, ate and whored his way through his reign.\n\nJon Arryn died in King's Landing immediately prior to the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement. Jon is survived by his wife Lysa and their six-year-old son, Robin Arryn. Near the end of his life, Jon was investigating the legitimacy of the children of Queen Consort, Cersei Lannister. He later died from unknown, and unexplained, causes just after discovering that the children were secretly not the biological children of Robert Baratheon.\n\nHis dying words were to Robert Baratheon, \"The seed is strong.\"\n\nJon Arryn's body is laid out in state in the throne room of the Red Keep in King's Landing. Ser Jaime Lannister and Queen Cersei discuss Jon's attempts to learn the truth about their incestuous relationship and his failure to do so. Later, news of Jon's death reaches Eddard Stark at Winterfell, who is shocked and upset as he considered Jon to be a second father to him. Catelyn then receives a letter from Lysa accusing House Lannister for murdering Jon.\n\nWhen Eddard Stark attends his first Small Council meeting in King's Landing, he is shocked to learn that the realm is six million Gold Dragons in debt, and refuses to believe that Jon Arryn would let this happen. Grand Maester Pycelle and Renly Baratheon explain to Lord Stark that while Jon gave wise and prudent advice, King Robert did not always follow it.\n\nArryn had asked Pycelle for The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, a book detailing genealogies of the nobility, which notes the heredity preponderance for black hair in House Baratheon.\n\nEddard Stark is told that Arryn visited with an armorer, Tobho Mott, several times before his death and also talked with his apprentice Gendry, inquiring about his mother. Stark immediately realizes upon meeting with Gendry that he is King Robert's bastard son.\" On the day he died, Arryn met with Mhaegen, a prostitute at Lord Petyr Baelish's brothel. She showed him her infant daughter, Barra, who was fathered by King Robert Baratheon.\n\nVarys privately warns Eddard that he thinks Jon Arryn was murdered by an unknown party for asking too many questions, using a rare and untraceable poison known as the Tears of Lys.\n\nUnder forceful interrogation by Tyrion Lannister, Grand Maester Pycelle confesses that he knew that Jon Arryn had unearthed the truth upon seeing Robert's bastard children that Queen Cersei's three children were not conceived by Robert, but by her twin brother Jaime Lannister. Pycelle states that Jon Arryn intended to act and reveal his discovery to King Robert. When Tyrion accuses Pycelle of having Jon poisoned to keep the truth from getting out, he angrily denies that he killed him. Tyrion then points out that Pycelle must have realized that someone had poisoned Arryn (and he wasn't simply sick), but he let him succumb anyway, so he has Pycelle thrown into the Black Cells.\n\nAfter being reunited with Petyr Baelish, Lysa obsessively declares her love for him and the things she has done to demonstrate it, including lacing Jon's wine with Tears of Lys and then sending a letter to Catelyn accusing House Lannister of the assassination.\n\nEventually, Petyr is forced to answer for his many crimes, including his role in the Assassination of Jon Arryn, when Sansa Stark unexpectedly puts him on trial. Sansa publicly accuses Petyr of persuading Lysa (whom Petyr also murdered) to poison Jon with Tears of Lys and write a letter to her sister Catelyn, falsely accusing the Lannisters of killing her husband, igniting the conflict between both great houses. When Petyr's guilt becomes plain for all to see, his cries for mercy are coldly rebuffed by Sansa, who has her sister Arya Stark slit his throat, exacting justice for Jon.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jon_Arryn"}}

However, that does not mean that violence in the city is unheard of, with Dothraki devising cunning means to kill without the use of steel or shedding of blood."],"name":"Khalasar","description":"In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, a khalasar is a tribe of horse riders led by a Khal (warlord). They contain thousands of mounted Dothraki warriors, the largest containing tens of thousands.\n\nKhalasars are subdivided into khas, each of which is commanded by a captain known as a ko (plural, kos).\n\nLeadership of a khalasar is not strictly hereditary. Often when a khal dies his khalasar will break up into new smaller ones led by his surviving kos. The Dothraki follow strength, so if the son of the current khal is weak or underaged, they have no reason to follow him (i.e. Daenerys carrying Drogo's unborn son was no reason for his khalasar to continue to follow her). This way the Dothraki never have a weak child leader inherit rule, which might imperil their survival (such as when the eight year old Tommen Baratheon inherited the Iron Throne in Westeros). Other times, however, the son and heir of an older and successful khal may have himself grown to young adulthood and become a strong and revered warrior in his own right - in which case leadership of the entire khalasar will indeed pass to the son of the khal, instead of breaking up upon his death. In such cases the adult son and heir of the current khal is known as a khalakka: Drogo was khalakka to his father Bharbo and directly succeeded him upon his death, given that by that time Drogo was already a skilled and respected warrior.\n\nDothraki khalasars have no names, nor do any have particularly long-lasting or deep histories and affiliations. Khalasars frequently dissolve on the death of their khal into new, smaller khalasars. On the other extreme, when one khalasar conquers another khalasar, if often absorbs the remaining forces of the defeated khalasar instead of simply massacring them. In this fashion one khalasar numbering only a few thousand riders can rapidly aggregate more and more lesser khalasars into itself until it is a single large khalasar numbering in the tens of thousands. The actual number of riders in any one khalasar is therefore fluid, as they are frequently dissolving, coalescing into different groups, dissolving again, then re-combining with entirely different groups, etc.\n\nGenerally, the khalasars considered large number in the low tens of thousands (the adult male mounted warriors - the women, children, elderly, and slaves moving with the entire khalasar will number more than that). Several khalasars of this size seem to be active at any given time. Khal Drogo's khalasar contained about 40,000 mounted riders, which was considered unusually large. Back during the great wave of Dothraki expansion in the Century of Blood following the fall of Valyria, a few khalasars reached even larger sizes. Khal Temmo's horde at the Battle of Qohor was said to number 50,000. The largest battle of the Dothraki in the Century of Blood was the \"Field of Crows\", the climactic battle in their campaign against Sarnor, the coalition of city-states at the western end of the Dothraki Sea. Hoping to finally stop the advance of the Dothraki, the Sarnori fielded an allied army of 26,000 horse and 100,000 infantry. To face this force, four separate Dothraki khals allied their four khalasars into a massive force of 80,000 mounted warriors - apparently an unprecedented number, and they succeeded in crushing the Sarnori. The Dothraki politically fragmented after the first few generations of the Century of Blood, however, so that in subsequent centuries Drogo's khalasar of 40,000 was considered atypically large.\n\nAfter Drogo was rendered catatonic (and soon died), his khalasar broke up into several smaller khalasars led by his former kos. Pono was the first to leave, with 10,000 riders, and he was followed by Jhaqo who left with 20,000 riders (fully half of Drogo's original khalasar). Jorah explains that over the next few days several smaller bands from the remaining 10,000 riders split off and left as well: Jorah doesn't give the names of their leaders or exactly how many follow each of them, but he does say that (together with Pono and Jhaqo) about a \"dozen\" new khalasars formed out of the breakup of Drogo's old one. Given that the remaining 10,000 riders divided up into ten or so smaller groups, however - admittedly of greater and lesser sizes - these smaller bands probably didn't number more than around one or two thousand each.\n\nOn the other hand, in the years since Drogo's death another round of warring between different khalasars across the Dothraki Sea has led to some being destroyed, and others agglomerating into much larger sizes by absorbing defeated ones. By the fifth novel, Khal Jhaqo's force was again in the east near Lhazar and Meereen, and his khalasar encounters Daenaerys when she flies back there on her dragon. Khal Pono, meanwhile, is said to now have a khalasar of 30,000 mounted warriors - meaning he apparently absorbed several defeated khalasars. Pono's force, however, is now said to be at the western end of the Dothraki Sea, near the headwaters of the Selhoryu River (a tributary of the Rhoyne) - south of Qohor and northeast of Volantis. It is feared that Pono's khalasar will soon menace Volantis, though many anticipate that he will simply leave again after being given customary tribute.\n\nAccording to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, \"Khalasar\" is pronounced \"KHAL-uh-ssar\".\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Khalasar"}}

It is a great and potentially problematic violation of tradition if a khaleesi elects not to do this. In addition to serving as the communal residence of the dosh khaleen, the Temple is used to host important ceremonies and the occasional feast for the current Great Khal. The Khalar vezhven, the gathering of khals to determine which cities to plunder and which populations to enslave, is held within the Temple.\n\nDaenerys is summoned by the dosh khaleen to eat a stallion's heart so that the crones can read the omens, with the ceremony taking place in the temple itself. At first it seems she won't hold the raw meat down, but to both her and Drogo's relief she is able to compose herself. The crones declare Daenerys and Drogo's son will be \"The Stallion Who Mounts the World\", a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in Dothraki history. Daenerys says his name will be Rhaego, after her brother Rhaegar Targaryen who was slain in the rebellion by Robert Baratheon. Later on, Dany's brother Viserys interrupts a feast held within the Temple, and commits the ultimate sacrilege by drawing a weapon. Khal Drogo, careful not to violate tradition himself, melts down some gold in a pot and pours it over Viserys's head, killing him; a bloodless death that is tolerated by both Daenerys and the dosh khaleen.\n\nAfter being captured by the Dothraki, Daenerys was offered to Khal Moro as a gift. She eventually earned the respect of the khal after explaining to him that she was Khal Drogo's wife. However, instead of escorting her to Meereen as per her request, Khal Moro's wife tells her that she must remain in the temple of Vaes Dothrak with the dosh khaleen for the rest of her life as she was a widow of a khal and a former khaleesi.\n\nDaenerys is welcomed to the Temple by the High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen, who admonishes her for not returning to the Temple immediately after Khal Drogo's death. She relates her own history as the wife of Khal Savo to connect with Daenerys, but warns her that because she violated tradition, it is up to the khals assembling for the Khalar vezhven to decide whether Daenerys will join their ranks.\n\nLater on, the High Priestess, clearly hoping that Daenerys will be allowed to stay with them, explains the politics of the dosh khaleen, and that some of them dislike Daenerys and her obvious Valyrian features, thinking that the Dothraki shouldn't breed with outsiders. The high priestess dismisses them, however, pointing out that the Dothraki have always interbred and taken outsiders as khaleesi. She points out a khaleen of Lhazareen origin to illustrate her point.\n\nThe khalar vezhven, is held within the Temple, although the dosh khaleen themselves only make an appearance to bring Daenerys before the Khals to be judged. The Mother of Dragons turns the tables on the khals and destroys the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, killing everyone inside. The dosh khaleen are amongst the crowd gathering to watch the conflagration, and when they see Daenerys emerge from the flames unburnt, they bow with the rest.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Temple_of_the_Dosh_khaleen"}}

She is later poisoned by Cersei Lannister for her role in Myrcella's murder.","In the beginning of A Feast for Crows, Tyene is the third of the Sand Snakes who confronts Prince Doran about his failure to avenge their father. She waits for him at the Old Palace in Sunspear. She is aware of Obara's plan to declare a war against the Lannisters and Nymeria's plan to poison Tywin, Cersei, Jaime and Tommen, but has a different plan: since Dornishmen fight best at home, they will crown Myrcella (who is the lawful heir of the Iron Throne, not Tommen, by the Dornish inheritance law) in order to provoke the Lannisters and the Tyrells to come down to Dorne; then the Dornish troops shall bleed them in the passes and bury them beneath the blowing sands, as happened many times before.

She is also his eldest daughter by his paramour, Ellaria Sand. Tyene fights using a pair of long daggers, though her other signature weapon is her skill with poisons - a tactic she learned from her father. Like her father, she is known to coat her blades with poisons, making a single scratch lethal.\n\nTyene can feign being soft-spoken and childlike, but this is just an act to keep her enemies off guard, as she is just as fierce as her older sisters.\n\nTyene is the youngest of the four adult Sand Snakes, and more impetuous than her older sisters Obara and Nymeria. Where Obara will face threats head-on (confident in her martial prowess), and Nymeria will stand back and analyze the situation to make a precise strike at her enemy's weak points, Tyene tends to heedlessly charge ahead. This is exemplified by her choice of daggers as her main hand-held weapon: they are quick on the draw, allowing her to lash out quickly, before even her older sisters can restrain her.\n\nOberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister.\n\nWhen Ellaria Sand goes to the Water Gardens to scold Doran for his inaction to Oberyn's murder, she tells the Prince that Dorne must go to war against the Lannisters, and points out that the Sand Snakes, who have the love of their people, agree with her, and that they will avenge their father if Doran does not.\n\nTyene, Nymeria, and Obara meet with Ellaria, who embraces her daughter Tyene warmly. They discuss rallying Dorne to go to war against House Lannister. When the conversation shifts to Myrcella Baratheon, Obara reveals information she received from a merchant captain that Jaime Lannister has been smuggled into Dorne. Ellaria insists that they must stop Jaime from reaching Myrcella. They are presented with a choice: side with Doran and have peace, or side with Ellaria and have war. Tyene is the first to speak, saying she will always side with her mother, and then Nymeria and Obara also agree to side with Ellaria.\n\nWhen the Sand Snakes make their attempt to kidnap Myrcella, Tyene battles Bronn with the help of her sister Nym while Obara goes after Jaime Lannister. Although she manages to wound Bronn in the arm with one of her daggers, the battle is quickly broken up by Areo Hotah and the rest of Doran's personal guard. After a tense confrontation, Obara commands her sisters to drop their weapons, and Tyene does so. They, along with Jaime, Bronn and Ellaria Sand, are taken into custody.\n\nThe Sand Snakes are imprisoned for their part in Myrcella's attempted kidnapping, with Bronn in the cell next to them. Tyene seduces Bronn from behind the bars of her cell, all while asking about the cut she inflicted on him during their earlier fight. Unknown to Bronn, Tyene coated her daggers with a poison called The Long Farewell, and her attempts to seduce him were in an effort to raise his heart rate, hastening the poison's course through his body. His vision blurs, his nose bleeds, and he collapses along a wall in his cell. Tyene removes an ampoule containing the antidote from her necklace and offers it to Bronn, but only if he tells her that she is the most beautiful woman in the world. Barely coherent, he replies that she is, and is thrown the ampoule. He manages to drink it before passing out.\n\nAs Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game of reflexes with each other, Areo Hotah arrives at their prison cell to escort the three Sand Snakes to the Water Gardens. Tyene is forced to watch along with the other Sand Snakes as Prince Doran forces Ellaria to swear her allegiance to him in the Water Gardens, bound at the wrist.\n\nTyene and her sisters later watch as Princess Myrcella departs for King's Landing along with Jaime, Bronn, and Prince Trystane. Tyene sexually jokes with Bronn and promises that they may see each other again. After Ellaria seals Myrcella's fate with a poison kiss, Tyene offers a cloth for her mother to wipe the blood from her nose, an effect from the poison coated on her lips, as they watch Myrcella's boat from afar. Though the young Lannister is killed, Ellaria survives, drinking up the antidote.\n\nTyene and Ellaria are with Doran when a maester appears to deliver a message, bearing news of Ellaria's murder of Myrcella. Before the prince has a chance to react Tyene stabs Areo Hotah in the spine, killing him immediately before Ellaria assassinates Doran. Tyene also kills Maester Caleotte by throwing her dagger into his back as he tries to flee, despite Caleotte possessing no threat whatsoever (it is possible that Tyene killed him just for fun), and watches with satisfaction as her uncle bleeds to death. Months later, Tyene is present with her sisters when Ellaria meets with Olenna Tyrell in the Water Gardens. The Queen of Thorns shuts down Tyene when she attempts to speak, demanding that the \"grown women\" speak without interruption. Ellaria claims that Dorne and House Tyrell must work together for justice and vengeance, as Queen Cersei has declared war on both of their factions. Varys then appears, claiming that they will defeat Cersei with \"Fire and Blood\", making it quite clear that Ellaria, the Sand Snakes, and House Tyrell will support Daenerys Targaryen's claim to the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nTyene, her sisters, and their mother travel with Yara Greyjoy's Ironborn fleet through the Narrow Sea to lay siege to King's Landing. Tyene, Obara, and Nymeria casually joke about killing Lannisters. Shortly later, Yara's fleet is ambushed by the new Lord Reaper of Pyke Euron Greyjoy's Iron Fleet. Tyene and Ellaria flee below the deck while a skirmish rages above. Obara and Nymeria are killed while Euron takes Tyene, Ellaria, and Yara prisoner.\n\nEuron proudly delivers Tyene and Ellaria to Kings Landing, bringing them to the feet of Cersei as a gift. Eventually both Tyene and her mother are gagged and chained to the wall of a dungeon. After taunting Ellaria on how she should exact her revenge, Cersei advances on Tyene, praising her \"perfect Dornish beauty\" and musing she must be Ellaria's favorite child by Oberyn. Realizing Cersei intends to kill Tyene in retaliation for Myrcella's death, Ellaria desperately tries to beg for her daughter's life, but being gagged, her pleas are unintelligible. Cersei muses that she contemplated having Gregor crush Ellaria and Tyene's skulls the same way he did Oberyn, but while poetic, in Ellaria's case, it would be too quick, while Cersei mockingly insists it wouldn't be right to have Tyene's \"pretty face crack like a duck's egg\" as she removes the girl's gag and kisses Tyene full on the lips.\n\nTyene desperately calls out for her mother before Qyburn gags her again as Cersei explains that Qyburn figured out the poison Ellaria used to kill Myrcella, the same one she used on Tyene. Qyburn assures Cersei that the poison will inevitably cause death, but how long depends on the strength of the victim's constitution. Cersei then gleefully informs a sobbing Ellaria that she will now be forced to spend her days watching Tyene die and then watch her daughter's \"beautiful face crumble to bone and dust\" before her eyes, promising Ellaria they will keep her alive to do so even if they have to force feed her. Once Cersei is gone, both Tyene and Ellaria try to reach one another, but with their chains too short, they are unable to embrace or comfort each other in her last hours.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tyene_Sand"}}

The second day they were gone was the hottest day in Volantis, so she and her brother joined the other children to go for a swim in the River Rhoyne. While she was talking with a friend, she noticed that her brother was missing. Eventually, she found him floating face down in the water. Talisa and her friend pulled him to the shore but he was dead. Suddenly, a man with a tattoo of a fish on his face (marking him as a fishing boat slave) came and pushed her away. Had she reported him, it would have meant death for the slave for touching a noble. The slave kept pushing down on her brother's chest again and again until he was revived. As the slave cradled her brother and calmed him down, Talisa was inspired by the slave's selfless act. She decided two things right there and then: first, that when she came of age, she would not waste her years dancing with other nobles, and second that she would never live in a place where slavery was legal again. To this end, she sought and obtained medical training (rather than dancing with other nobles) and relocated to Westeros (slavery being outlawed in the Seven Kingdoms).\n\nTalisa tends to a wounded Lannister soldier after the Battle of Oxcross, finding that his foot needs to be amputated. King Robb Stark aids her by holding the man down and giving him a gag to bite on, pointing out that it's better than biting his tongue. After the operation Talisa criticizes Robb for fighting to usurp the crown without having a replacement king, as Robb only claims the title of King in the North. Talisa also points out that the wounded Lannister soldier was a fisherman who had been conscripted, like many others, into the Lannister army and that the forces Robb's army defeated weren't trained soldiers for the most part. As she leaves, Robb tells Talisa that the soldier was lucky she was there to save him and she responds by saying it was unlucky for the soldier that Robb was there.\n\nTalisa follows Robb Stark's army camp as it moves. Robb introduces her to his mother Catelyn Stark, and when she asks about her family, Talisa says that their name is \"Maegyr\". Talisa says that being from Volantis, she isn't familiar with the titles of nobility used in the Seven Kingdoms. Robb watches Talisa as she leaves and Catelyn reminds him that he is not free to love where he will.\n\nAfter a meeting with his bannermen, Talisa seeks Robb out to ask for more medical supplies. She has heard Robb is about to leave for The Crag to negotiate a surrender, which has the things she needs. She wants to write a list to send to the Crag's maester, but Robb suggests she should come with him and get the supplies herself. On their way back they discuss Robb's father Eddard Stark and the lessons he taught Robb about caring for his subjects. They are interrupted by news that Catelyn has released Robb's key prisoner Jaime Lannister. Talisa later goes to comfort Robb. After she reveals more of her past to him they admit their shared feelings for one another and have sex.\n\nRobb talks to his mother about Talisa. Catelyn says that she and Eddard were an arranged marriage, they barely knew each other, and yet found happiness together. However, Robb wants more than that possibility. Talisa and Robb marry in secret before a septon, pledging their lives to each other.\n\nTalisa is recalling to Robb about her mother's prejudices towards Westerosi when Roose Bolton arrives with the news of Hoster Tully's death and that Winterfell has been sacked with Bran and Rickon Stark still missing. While traveling to Riverrun for Hoster Tully's funeral, Talisa notices that Catelyn is making a prayer wheel for the Faith of the Seven. Talisa offers to help her, but Catelyn explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their children. When Talisa asks her mother-in-law if she made them before, Catelyn says twice, most recently for her younger son Bran to survive his fall shortly before the present war began. Catelyn then goes on to reveal to Talisa that the first time she made one was many years earlier for Jon Snow, Robb's half-brother, when he came down with the pox, something Catelyn attributed to her prayers for Jon to die and which she repented. Talisa asks if Jon survived, and Catelyn responds that he did.\n\nWhile at Riverrun, she comforts Robb and attempts to help him with his battle strategizing. She tends to two wounded young Lannister squires. After they are murdered by Rickard Karstark in a petty revenge on Jaime Lannister, she and the rest of Robb's family urge Robb to spare Karstark and send him to the Night's Watch after the war in order to keep the Karstarks, but their pleas fall on deaf ears and Robb beheads him, leading to the Karstark army abandoning Robb and leaving his numbers depleted. Robb later admits to Talisa that he should have listened to her advice.\n\nLater, on the road to the Twins, after a passionate session of lovemaking with Robb, Talisa writes a letter in Valyrian, claiming it is for her mother. She teases Robb over his limited knowledge of the language before asking him to visit Volantis with her after the war is over, as Talisa would like to introduce her mother to her husband... and her grandchild. It takes a moment for the news of her pregnancy to sink in and the couple happily embrace. When Robb and his supporters reach The Twins, Lord Walder Frey inspects Talisa and insists that Robb broke his marriage pact not for love, but for \"firm tits and a tight fit.\" His salacious remarks stir Robb to anger, but Catelyn firmly places a hand on his arm to pacify him before he does anything extreme. Lord Frey quickly alleviates the tension by claiming he would have \"broken 50 vows without a second thought\" to be with a woman like Talisa at Robb's age. After Edmure Tully marries Roslin Frey, Robb jokes that perhaps he made a mistake in marrying Talisa, who feigns offense. She is bewildered by the traditional Westerosi bedding, which Robb explains proves that the marriage was consummated. Talisa replies that their unborn child is proof enough, and suggests that if it is a boy they name him Eddard after Robb's father, which Robb agrees to. After the bedding, the doors are closed and the musicians begin playing \"The Rains of Castamere\", which visibly makes Catelyn uneasy. Lord Walder rises to toast Robb, stating that he has yet to give his new queen a wedding gift. Realizing they have been betrayed, Catelyn slaps Roose across the face and yells a warning to Robb, but by then it is too late. As a startled Talisa sits at a table, Lothar Frey approaches her from behind and begins to repeatedly stab her in the stomach with a dagger, fatally wounding her and killing her unborn child. At that moment, Robb and his men are either shot by the musicians with crossbows or set upon by Frey soldiers. Talisa rises in an attempt to flee but instantly collapses due to her wounds and dies minutes later in her husband's arms. The death of Talisa and their child sends Robb into a state of shock, and he remains holding her in his arms as his men are slaughtered around him. Moments later, Robb and Catelyn are then killed by Roose Bolton and Black Walder Rivers, respectively. While the deaths of Robb and Catelyn and how their bodies were desecrated by the Freys are discussed in detail by friends and foes alike, what happens to Talisa's body in the aftermath remains unknown.\n\nWhen Walder Frey learns that Riverrun has been retaken by Brynden Tully, who had escaped the Red Wedding, he dispatches Lothar and Black Walder to retake the castle, using the captive Edmure, and orders Lothar to present the Blackfish with the knife he used to kill Talisa and her unborn child. She is mentioned again unfavorably by Robett Glover as a \"foreign whore\" for distracting Robb while other members of House Glover suffered during the ironborn occupation of Deepwood Motte. Eventually, Talisa is avenged by her sister-in-law Arya Stark, who murders Lothar Frey and Black Walder and bakes them both into pies that she serves to their father Walder before slitting his throat as Black Walder had done to Catelyn.\n\nArya, disguised as Walder, later holds a feast with the rest of the Freys, commending them for the \"bravery\" at the Red Wedding as they slaughtered their unsuspecting guests, including the pregnant Talisa. However, all the Frey men quickly succumb to poison, and Arya reveals her true identity.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Talisa_Stark"}}

Those armies are no more than jokes: for instance, the Clanker Lords have chained their troops together in groups of ten, wrist to wrist and ankle to ankle.\n\nThe members of Windblown sellsword company, which was hired by Yunkai, have a very low opinion about the Wise Masters and their private \"armies\". They take delight in inventing ridicluous nicknames for the Wise Masters, as written above, and mocking them at every opportunity (not in their presence, of course).\n\nRazdal mo Eraz is named \"Grazdan mo Eraz\" in the novels; the TV series apparently changed his name to avoid confusion, as \"Grazdan\" is a very common name in Slaver's Bay held by multiple characters.\n\nIn the novels, Yezzan zo Qaggaz is actually one of the Wise Masters from Yunkai, morbidly obese and one of the leading slave-masters. The TV series heavily condensed the role so when he appears in Season 5, he is just a slender, normal-looking slave-trader who purchases Tyrion and Jorah at auction when they arrive in Meereen - without specifying if he is actually one of the Great Masters \"from\" Meereen, or if he is a Yunkish slaver-master who just happens to be in Meereen for the Great Games.\n\nThe Wise Masters endlessly bicker among themselves over who has precedence, both in terms of raw power and more arcane and complex principles of peerage which are confusing and inscrutable to outsiders. When their armies march out against Daenerys there are a disproportionately large number of \"captains\" and \"commanders\", about forty, because any slave-master who can muster up a two hundred poorly trained slaves considers himself the equal of one of the more powerful ones who actually possesses two thousand well-trained footsoldiers. The Wise Masters heavily rely upon hired sellsword companies and slave-soldiers: even the sellswords that accept their contracts for good payment consider the slave-masters themselves to generally be foppish aristocrats playing at politics and war.\n\nYurkhaz zo Yunzak is the most prominent of the Wise Masters and the Supreme Commander of the Armies and Allies of Yunkai. Grazdan mo Eraz and Yezzan zo Qaggaz are two of the most capable of the Wise Masters.\n\nEraz is a skilled diplomat, first attempting to simply bribe Daenerys to leave, and later he seeks to make common cause with the slaver-masters in Volantis, deftly flattering them with gifts and propaganda about what a tyrant Daenerys has become - and succeeds.\n\nYezzan, however, stands foremost amongst the Yunkish lords who favor honoring the peace with Meereen. He objects to those who want to assault the city immediately, nor does he consent to return the hostages Daenerys has delivered them (Daario, Jhogo, Hero, Groleo and three of Hizdahr's kin) by way of trebuchet, as the evil sellsword Bloodbeard has proposed. Yezzan, more intelligently, urges caution and diplomacy - saying that fighting Daenerys's Unsullied and her growing dragons is more trouble than it is worth, and if they start fighting her again they might lose and end up being overthrown. However, Yurkhaz zo Yunzak is the one who makes the decisions for Yunkai, and he leads the Yunkai army to fight Daenerys.\n\nFollowing Yurkhaz's death, Yezzan had the most support to replace him, but he has contracted the bloody flux and died. The rest of the Yunkish lords are no more than incompetent fools, and are unable to agree who should take charge. They have been rotating the supreme command amongst themselves; naturally, that adds to the chaos that erupted in their ranks - what works in favor of Daenerys's loyalists.\n\nUnlike the Great Masters of Meereen, of which six slaver families were identifies as the major ones (alongside other smaller ones), the leading families of Wise Masters haven't been clearly identified. The family names of some of the Wise Masters leading Yunkai's army against Daenerys are Qaggaz, Eraz, Myraq, Rhaezn, Ahlaq, Zerzyn, and Faez - but it wasn't clarified if all of these are \"major\" families, given the direct complaint that less powerful slave-masters were claiming equal right to command over their combined forces, etc.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Wise_Masters"}}

Brynden is a respected knight and formidable battle commander, who first distinguished himself in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, nearly forty years before the War of the Five Kings.\n\nBrynden often argued with his older brother Hoster, particularly over the fact that Brynden never married. When Brynden returned home from the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Hoster had already arranged for him to marry Bethany Redwyne, of the wealthy and powerful House Redwyne. Brynden refused this generous match, however, refusing to be told when and whom to marry. Hoster was angry that Brynden would not do his duty to their family and enter into a marriage-alliance to improve their fortunes, and said that he was the black goat of the Tully herd. Brynden joked that given that the Tully sigil is a trout, it would be more fitting to say that he was the \"black fish\" of the Tully school. The nickname stuck, and Ser Brynden became popularly known as \"The Blackfish\" ever since. Brynden even took to using a black fish in his own personal heraldry, which like the standard Tully heraldry it uses a red and blue background, but swaps out the normal silver trout for a black one. Hoster would attempt to contract other arranged marriage-alliances for Brynden over the years, many of them very promising matches, but Brynden turned down them all, which led to constant bickering between the two brothers throughout their lives.\n\nDespite his disagreements with his brother over his refusal to marry, Brynden is very devoted to his family.\n\nDuring the funeral of Hoster Tully, an annoyed Brynden takes the place of his nephew, Lord Edmure, after the latter fails several times to hit the funeral boat with flaming arrows. Later on he also chides Edmure for calling Robb \"nephew\" instead of treating him as his King as Edmure defends his course of action that led to the Battle of Stone Mill. He also consoles Catelyn when she muses about her father's funeral and whether she will ever see Bran and Rickon again, whose whereabouts are unknown following the Sack of Winterfell.\n\nThe Blackfish brings Rickard Karstark and his men before King Robb after they brutally murder Willem and Martyn Lannister as revenge against House Lannister. Brynden is highly offended when Rickard makes a derogatory comment about Ned Stark and punches him in the face in retaliation. Brynden counsels King Robb not to execute Lord Karstark but instead to keep him as a hostage, thus keeping the Karstark forces loyal to the Starks. King Robb disagrees, however, and executes Lord Karstark under charges of treason while Brynden watches on along with Edmure, Talisa and Catelyn. The Blackfish is again present when \"Black Walder\" and Lothar Frey come to Riverrun to discuss an alliance between House Stark and House Frey. The Freys demand that Edmure must marry one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters if the alliance is to go ahead. Edmure is reluctant to agree to these terms but Brynden tells him that he must if they have any hope of winning the war. Edmure finally relents.\n\nEn route to the Twins for Edmure's wedding, Brynden agrees with Catelyn that Walder Frey is the prickliest man he has ever met, and quips that he has seen \"wet shits I like more than Walder Frey\". When they finally reach the Twins, Brynden is visibly angered when Walder Frey lightly insults Talisa, but stays himself. During the wedding feast, he drinks heavily and brings up Roose Bolton's marriage to Frey's granddaughter Walda to further cement their alliance. Roose confides to Brynden and Catelyn that he actually did it since Frey promised him a dowry of silver matching Walda's weight. Brynden briefly goes outside to relieve himself on a tree, narrowly escaping the Red Wedding massacre that follows shortly after and claims the lives of Robb, Catelyn, Talisa and all of their Northern allies; the Blackfish either sneaked away or fought his way through the chaos to escape the Twins.\n\nRoose Bolton and Walder Frey later discover that The Blackfish escaped. Though Frey is undisturbed, Roose is visibly concerned that Brynden will reach the safety of Riverrun before he is found.\n\nPetyr Baelish informs Sansa Stark that Brynden has reunited the remnants of the Tully army and successfully taken back Riverrun from House Frey, and he advises her to seek her uncle out for help retaking the North. Heeding this advice, Sansa sends Brienne of Tarth to meet with Brynden.\n\nLord Walder Frey berates his sons for losing Riverrun, and requests help from the Lannisters in taking it back, thus beginning the Second Siege of Riverrun. While parleying with Jaime Lannister, the Blackfish informs him that Riverrun can hold out for two years, and that he must be ready to lose thousands of men if he wants to storm Riverrun. Realizing that the Blackfish has no intention of surrendering, Jaime is furious that he had to meet him at all.\n\nLater, Brienne of Tarth arrives with Sansa Stark's letter, asking the Blackfish to send his forces North to join Sansa and Jon's army. The Blackfish refuses to give up Riverrun, even for his great-niece. Edmure is sent to retake the castle from the Tully garrison, under threat of the murder of his son. The Blackfish knows that Edmure is not coming of his own free will, and orders the men not to let him in. Though the Blackfish commands the forces at Riverrun, formal authority is vested in Edmure as the rightful head of House Tully and the Lord of Riverrun, and his men are obliged to obey Edmure, not the Blackfish. As his men allow Edmure into Riverrun, a disheartened Blackfish leaves the battlements. Edmure orders his men to surrender and that his uncle be put in chains, but the Blackfish refuses to surrender and resolves to kill as many men as he can. He leads Brienne and her squire Podrick Payne into a waterway to escape Riverrun on a boat. He stays to die fighting for his home, though he admits he'll \"probably make a fool\" of himself due to a lack of recent combat experience.\n\nA Lannister soldier later reports to Jaime that the Blackfish was killed while resisting arrest. Though Jaime appears saddened that he has helped the Freys murder another member of Catelyn's family, it is unknown if he gave the Blackfish a proper funeral or allowed the Freys to desecrate his corpse as they did to Catelyn and Robb at the Red Wedding.\n\nAs the Freys and Lannisters celebrate their retaking of Riverrun at the Twins, Lord Walder gloats about the Blackfish's death at the hands of common foot soldiers. Later, however, the Blackfish and all those who died at the Red Wedding are finally avenged by his great-niece Arya Stark, who murders Lord Walder and his sons, Black Walder and Lothar.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Brynden_Tully"}}

He introduced Andros to Lord Ludd Whitehill, and is a well-known merchant in the ironwood business. He is also an eligible bachelor.\n\nMorgryn was sent along with Andros by Lord Ludd Whitehill to King's Landing in order to negotiate a sell of ironwood with Tyrion Lannister. After an hour of waiting in the Red Keep, the two ambassadors were introduced to Mira Forrester, much to their surpise. Morgryn urged Andros to be polite after the latter became angry over Mira's presence, and continued to try to calm Andros to no avail. Tyrion ended his meeting with the two ambassadors in order to deal directly with Mira, and Morgryn asked him to reconsider their arrangement before leaving.\n\nMorgryn was invited to the royal wedding. While there, he converses with Lord Garibald Tarwick and later prevented Lucan from detaining Mira by bumping into Lucan, causing his wine to spill on his shirt, and ordered Mira to help him clean up and threatened Lucan's job. Morgryn is impressed that she stole the ironwood deal, then warned her that Tyrion was trying to play House Forrester and House Whitehill against each other in order to secure the cheapest possible price for the ironwood. He began to offer his alliance with Mira, but they are interrupted by the assassination of King Joffrey Baratheon and the arrest of Tyrion. Morgryn quickly leaves the scene, telling Mira to get the ironwood decree from Tyrion's chambers if she wished to forge an alliance with him.\n\nMorgryn attends Tommen's Coronation Feast in this episode. Morgryn is seen arguing with Andros by Mira when she sneaks in with the help of her friend. Morgryn will move over to a new group of friends, dissuading them from their initial curiosity as to why he is no longer in the Ironwood business. Morgryn dismisses their theories, saying that he simply has no more interest in it. However, this proves to be false when Mira overhears Andros discussing his partnership with House Whitehill. Morgryn is confronted by Mira with this information, and he admits that he was pushed out of the business when Whitehill took Andros upon as an exclusive dealer. Morgryn holds disdain for Andros for this, and this is apparent when Mira later argues with Andros, and Morgryn compliments her on getting him so angry. While Morgryn seemed both surprised and pleased that Mira destroyed her contract with Tyrion without being detected, the proposed deal they had is now nullified now that he isn't in the ironwood business.\n\nMira can eavesdrop on Morgryn's conversation, and learn that Morgryn is single. If so desired, the player can also have Mira ask about him to Tarwick. Tarwick will reveal that while he is handsome, he also has an unexplained reputation of being dangerous.\n\nWhen Mira was chased by Lannister guards, she seeks refugee with Morgryn. He bribes the guards and invites her into his litter. He reveals that it was him who hired Ser Damien to kill her, since she got in his way of Ironwood trade. He then tossed her out and handed her over to Lucan.\n\nMorgryn later comes to Mira's cell, with the offer of wedding Mira so he could have a claim on Ironrath and the Ironwood, as her family was about to be exterminated by the Whitehills. Mira can either agree with his proposal, becoming his wife and have Tom executed in her stead, or face execution herself.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rickard_Morgryn"}}

Later he walks up to him while he is alone in the forest saying that he and his sister have been searching for him for a long time so that they can protect him. Osha surprises Jojen by putting a spear to the back of his neck, but Osha releases him when Meera suddenly appears with a knife to Osha's neck. Osha warns Jojen that Summer will protect Bran, should Meera harm him but Summer sniffs Jojen's hand and walks on. Jojen and Bran bond as they discuss their fathers when Jojen recalls that he has traveled in his mind to witness Robert's Rebellion in his dreams. Jojen gives cryptic information about Bran's powers as a warg. Osha grows increasingly resentful of Jojen.\n\nJojen and Bran share a greensight dream where Bran climbs a tree to follow a three-eyed raven, although Bran falls after Catelyn Stark appears repeating her warning in which she made him promise never to climb again - a promise Bran broke. Bran and Jojen wake in their camp in the woods, disappointed that he could not follow the three-eyed raven.\n\nJojen Reed has another vision which appears as a seizure. Jojen then tells Bran that in his vision he saw Jon Snow surrounded by enemies.\n\nAfter seeking shelter in a derelict windmill during a rainstorm, the group notices a band of wildlings chasing down an old man. The sounds of thunder terrify Hodor, who shouts out in panic. Fearing discovery, Jojen tells Bran to silence Hodor, who keeps panicking. Bran unintentionally uses his Warg powers to render Hodor unconscious. With the wildlings still outside, Jojen convinces Bran to Warg through Summer and Shaggydog outside, who then maul to death some of the wildlings. While in control of Summer and Shaggydog, Bran sees Jon Snow outside fighting the wildlings. After this, Bran insists that he must go beyond the Wall to find the raven. However, he wants Rickon to be safe, so he tells Osha to take his brother with her to the holdfast of Greatjon Umber, a loyal bannerman of the Starks. Bran bids a tearful Rickon farewell, who leaves with Osha and Shaggydog, while Bran continues northward with Hodor, Summer and the Reed siblings.\n\nAt last, the group make it to the Wall and stay overnight in the Nightfort, an abandoned castle on the Wall that is rumored to be haunted. During the night, Jon Snow's fellow Night's Watch comrade Samwell Tarly, with Gilly and her child, emerge from a secret passageway. Samwell, noticing the gigantic Hodor and Summer, realizes who Bran is and offers to take them to Castle Black, but Jojen tells Sam that they are going beyond the Wall, as no force in the realm of Westeros could withstand the threat posed by the White Walkers. Sam reluctantly shows them the secret sally port and gives them the dragonglass daggers found at the Fist of the First Men, which he earlier used to slay a White Walker. That night, Bran, the Reeds, Hodor and Summer finally pass beyond the Wall.\n\nWhen Bran becomes obsessed with warging Summer, Jojen is forced to warn him of the dangers that perhaps Bran will be trapped by his own powers. He emphasises that they need Bran to survive. Heading further North, Jojen helps Bran find a heart tree. Bran touches the tree, triggering his greensight, showing him a larger heart tree where they must go to find the Three-eyed raven.\n\nLater, Bran and his companions are resting near Craster's Keep. They hear the faint sounds of a baby's cries. Bran enters the mind of Summer to investigate where he finds Ghost, the direwolf of Jon Snow. However, before he can free Ghost, Summer is caught by a trap. At Meera's urgings, they go to rescue Summer and Ghost but are taken prisoner by Karl. While Hodor is being tormented by Rast and the other mutineers for pure amusement, Karl threatens to kill Jojen and Meera before Bran gives up his identity.\n\nJojen and the others are being held imprisoned in a tent. Karl enters the tent and ties up Meera and prepares to rape and torture her. Jojen begs for mercy and offers to help them, saying he possesses the sight. Karl refuses and just before he cuts Meera, Jon Snow and members of the Night's Watch attack the keep. Locke, who really serves Roose Bolton, searches for Bran and finds him and attempts to escape the keep with Bran. However, Jojen signals Bran to warg into Hodor, allowing him to save his own body through Hodor's. When Bran is about to get Jon's attention, Jojen arrives and intervenes, telling him that Jon will not let him search for the Three-eyed raven if he goes with Jon back to Castle Black. Bran agrees and prepares to leave.\n\nThe group arrives at the tree from Bran's vision, but they are ambushed by wights that emerge from beneath the snow. Jojen is grabbed by one of the wights, but Meera comes to his aid before he is dragged beneath the snow. Meera successfully protects him, but one of the seemingly defeated wights pulls a knife out and repeatedly stabs him. Jojen lives long enough to see Leaf, a child of the forest, and tells his sister to go with Bran and the others. Before doing so, Meera mercifully cuts his throat. Soon after, the Leaf uses her magic to destroy Jojen's body to prevent its reanimation as another wight. The three-eyed raven then reveals that Jojen knew that the quest would cost his life.\n\nDuring Meera's rant at Bran, she mentions that Jojen, Summer and Hodor all died to make sure he survived for the Great War.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jojen_Reed"}}

Davos became one of Stannis's most loyal vassals. Matthos serves his father and King Stannis by working as a crewman on his father's warship and also as King Stannis's scribe. He is Stannis's squire and it is expected that one day he will become a knight.\n\nMatthos is present during the ritual burning of the images of the Seven, conducted by Melisandre, as offerings to the Lord of Light. Like the rest of the assembly, Matthos chants praises to the eastern god.\n\nInside the castle of Dragonstone, Stannis holds a meeting in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Matthos reads aloud from a letter that he has prepared stating Stannis's claim to the Iron Throne. Stannis objects to the use of \u201Cbeloved brother\u201D to refer to Robert, which Ser Davos calls harmless courtesy to no avail. Matthos continues to detail the illegitimacy of Joffrey Baratheon as a bastard born of incest between Queen Cersei and Jaime Lannister. Stannis insists that Jaime be called the Kingslayer and that he receive his title as a knight. Matthos finishes reading and Stannis says that Eddard Stark made a mistake by not telling more people when he learned the truth about Joffrey. He orders copies of the letter to be sent to every corner of the realm from the Arbor to the Wall. Stannis says that the time has come to choose and that he wants no man to be able to claim ignorance.\n\nMatthos remains while Davos fails to convince Stannis of seeking an alliance with either his brother Renly or Robb Stark and Maester Cressen attempts to poison Melisandre and only succeeds in dying while the Red Priestess survives unscathed.\n\nDavos and Matthos meet with the Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan on the beach of Dragonstone. Davos promises that Salladhor will be paid a fortune in gold when they take King's Landing. Salladhor points out that Stannis has the smallest army of the claimants to the Iron Throne and wonders why he should fight for the king with the smallest chance of victory. Davos tells him that it is a smart gamble to back Stannis because Stannis is a proven battle commander. He adds that Renly and Joffrey have never fought before. Davos adds that Stannis has just begun the fight and expects more of his bannerman to join his cause because he is the most honorable man in the Seven Kingdoms. Salladhor notes the irony of a smuggler vouching for the honor of a king.\n\nMatthos warns Salladhor to mind his words, calling him a pirate. Davos silences his son and Salladhor says that he was not insulted and asserts his pride in his reputation as an excellent pirate. Salladhor asserts that he does not sail for promises. Davos challenges this, explaining that Salladhor sails on a promise of ships to plunder every time he leaves port. Salladhor says that promise always comes true and Davos says that his promise is the same. Davos points out that Salladhor is not a young man and that pirate's lives are short. Salladhor jokes that only the clever pirates grow old. Davos suggests that Salladhor could continue to steal from cargo ships and live an easy life while it lasts but that he is offering a harder alternative with greater rewards. He promises riches and fame. Salladhor says that he has a good name for songs and then tells Davos that he wants Queen Cersei.\n\nHe says that he will lend his 30 ships provided he can sleep with Cersei when they take King's Landing. Matthos is annoyed by Salladhor's selfishness and says they are not fighting for Salladhor to rape the Queen. Salladhor makes the distinction that he does not intend to rape her and jokes that Matthos has not experienced his persuasiveness. Matthos insists that Stannis has a divine right to rule and Salladhor is dismissive of the claim, saying that he has heard similar all over the world. Matthos turns away and Davos says that he cannot promise the Queen, only the gold and glory. Sallashor asks if Davos believes that Stannis can win and Davos says that Stannis is the \u201Cone true king.\u201D Salladhor contrasts Davos's loyalty to Stannis against their history together; Stannis chopped off Davos's fingers for smuggling. Salladhor says that he will sail with Davos because Davos is the most honest smuggler he has ever met and asks Davos to make him rich. They shake hands and Salladhor leaves.\n\nMatthos asks Davos when Stannis will set sail. Davos says that it will be when Stannis's god wills it. Matthos takes offense and says that the Lord of Light is his god and Davos's god too. He urges Davos to learn to read so that he can experience the holy books for himself. Davos expresses his doubt in the power of prayer. Matthos says that Davos has always returned home. Davos says that he did not pray but Matthos counters that he always prayed for Davos to return. Davos says that he will put his faith in Stannis because of the opportunities he has given their family. Matthos says that Stannis is only a man and Davos warns him not to tell Stannis that.\n\nDavos and Matthos arrange model ships on the Painted Table. Stannis and Melisandre arrive and Davos reports his success recruiting Salladhor. Stannis is doubtful of their capability, saying that pirates prefer to fight unarmed men. Davos deadpans that it is the wiser choice and Stannis counters that they will not have a choice. Stannis asks Davos if he trusts Salladhor. Davos replies that he is an old friend and that they have known each other for thirty years but that he has never trusted Salladhor. Davos reassures his King that Salladhor will follow the scent of gold. Stannis promises that Salladhor will have his share if he gets the job done and dismisses the men. As they leave Melisandre stops Matthos and whispers in his ear, \"Death by fire is the purest death.\"\n\nMatthos serves aboard Stannis's flagship the Fury. They travel to the Stormlands where Renly dies in mysterious circumstances and Stannis assumes control of his forces. Stannis then sails on King's Landing, naming Davos as commander of his fleet. During the journey, Stannis asks Davos to serve as Hand of the King when he takes the Iron Throne.\n\nStannis's fleet, commanded by Davos, sweeps into Blackwater Bay and approaches the city at night. The original plan is to destroy the royal fleet and land troops under the city walls. However, the royal fleet proves to be absent. Instead, Tyrion has sent out a single ship pumping wildfire directly into the bay. Davos realizes too late that it is a trap, and screams at the ships to sail away from the royal vessel. At Tyrion's signal, Commander Bronn of the King's Landing City Watch ignites the wildfire with a flaming arrow. This results in a tremendous explosion that obliterates the leading elements of Stannis's fleet, including Davos's flagship, and kills Matthos, who was standing on the bridge of the ship, closest to the explosion.\n\nWhen Davos escorts Tyrion to King\u2019s Landing to secretly meet Jaime Lannister, whilst he himself meets with Gendry, Tyrion remarks that the last time he was here, he \u201Ckilled [his] father with a crossbow\u201D. Davos adds that last time he was here, Tyrion \u201Ckilled [his] son with wildfire\u201D. \n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Matthos_Seaworth"}}

At the age of 12, Daario was sold by his mother to a slave master from Tolos due to her declining income, alcoholism and his aggressive, unruly behavior and tendency to get into fights with other boys. He was trained as a pit fighter and had his first match in the pits when he was 16. Daario rose to fame within the fighting pits earning his master so much money that at the time of his master's death Daario was rewarded with freedom. Daario chose to fight as a sellsword for the Second Sons sometime after that.\n\nBesides being fluent in the Common Tongue, Daario is also fluent in Low Valyrian due to his Tyroshi origin. Daario also seems to speak some Dothraki, though it is unknown if he is fluent in it.\n\nDaario has an unusual code for a sellsword; he won't sleep with prostitutes and only kills soldiers who are trying to kill him, not bystanders. He does this because he feels that otherwise there is no sport and it is not exciting. Daario has said that the gods gave men two things to entertain themselves with before they die: the thrill of having sex with a woman who earnestly wants it, and the thrill of killing a man who is trying to kill you first.\n\nDaario is a highly skilled and capable warrior. Being trained a pit fighter since the age of 12 and then fighting as a sellsword after that, mostly all of Daario's life has revolved around fighting. During his years as a pit fighter he learned to fight with several different fighting styles; like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest and a Westerosi knight. Daario has over several different occasions proven his skills in combat: when he reveals to Daenerys that he single-handedly managed to kill both of the commanding officers of the Second Sons, when he along Ser Jorah and Grey Worm fight severly outnumbered against several guards in the streets of Yunkai, when he kills the Champion of Meereen in single combat with ease or when protecting Daenerys, Tyrion, and Missandei from hundreds of Sons of the Harpy along with Ser Jorah, coming out on top, unharmed, despite being outnumbered severely.\n\nDaario's weapons-of-choice are a Dothraki arakh and a Myrish stiletto, both which have gold-plated custom-made hilts in the shape of beautiful, naked women. His fighting style is based on speed and quick, accurate strikes with few, mostly finishing, blows based on pure strength due to his relatively small size and lean build compared to the larger, stronger opponents he frequently faced in the fighting pits.\n\nDaario Naharis joins the captains when they visit Daenerys Targaryen, who hopes to convince them to break their contract with Yunkai and fight for her instead. Daario sees through Daenerys's bluff that she has 10,000 Unsullied, reminding her that she has only 8,000. When the Second Sons depart with Daenerys's offer and a barrel of wine, Daario's gaze lingers on the young queen.\n\nBack at their own camp, Daario, Mero and Prendahl discuss the situation, with Mero and Prendahl deciding to assassinate Daenerys. At Mero's behest, a bedslave hands out random coins \u2013 Daario draws the Braavosi coin that indicates he is the one to do the deed. His only response is \"valar morghulis\" - \"all men must die\". That night, Daario, wearing the armor of an Unsullied slips into Daenerys' tent and takes Missandei hostage. He then presents the heads of Mero and Prendahl and informs her he has taken command of the Second Sons. Intrigued, Daenerys demands that he swear fealty to her. Daario bends the knee and swears the Second Sons, his sword, his life, and his heart to Daenerys.\n\nDaario later assists in planning the siege of Yunkai, and is selected, along with Ser Jorah Mormont and Grey Worm to infiltrate the city and open the gates from the inside. The plan succeeds brilliantly, and Jorah and Grey Worm return to their queen triumphant. Daenerys expresses concern over Daario's whereabouts, but he appears a moment later, presenting Yunkai's bloodstained flag to her.\n\nDaario is present outside the walls of Yunkai when Daenerys is greeted by the former slaves who have been liberated. He witnesses as the crowd lifts Daenerys up in the air as they shout \"Mhysa\" to her.\n\nSer Barristan and Missandei reveal that Grey Worm and Daario have been indulging in a bit of gambling; they have been at the contest since midnight and have missed a morning meeting with the queen as a result. Daenerys is very irritated to discover that their contest is a game of who can balance their sword for the longest, the prize being the honor of riding at her side when the march resumes. Daenerys assigns the pair to guard the livestock as punishment for their childish game. When they fail to move, she warns them that the \"winner\" of the contest must find a new queen, prompting them to drop their weapons instantly. Grey Worm's gaze lingers on Missandei, which Daario takes as a sign that he is interested in her, and points out that this problematic given Grey Worm's eunuch status. Grey Worm tells Daario that he is not a smart man for saying such things, to which Daario replies that he would rather have no brain and two balls.\n\nLater on, Daario slips away from his post to discuss \"strategy\" with Daenerys; he gives her flowers under the guise of a lesson in the botany of Slaver's Bay in which he points out that Daenerys must know the land she is to rule.\n\nAt the gate of Meereen, Daario volunteers to fight Meereen's champion in single combat after Daenerys rejects the rest of her inner circle from fighting. Daario declines the use of a horse, noting that they aren't as intelligent as humans. Daario ends the duel with ruthless efficiency, striking down the horse with his stiletto and decapitating the dazed champion with his arakh. After the Meereenese fire a volley of arrows in a symbol of displeasure, Daario urinates on the nearest one in a symbol of defiance.\n\nAfter Daenerys takes control of Meereen, Daario announces at a council meeting that the Second Sons have captured the 93 ships of the Meereenese Navy on his orders. When asked by Daenerys why the Seconds Sons took the navy without being instructed to, he responds by saying that he heard she liked ships. Later on, Daario comes to Daenerys' private quarters of the Great Pyramid and brings her flowers. As Dany refuses him, he tells he has only two talents in his life: war and women. Daenerys asks him about his loyalty and Daario swears his sword and life are hers and asks her to let him do what he can the best, so to send him to kill her enemies. Instead, Daenerys focuses on the other thing Daario claims to be good at and orders him to take off his clothes. When he leaves her bedchamber the following morning he runs into Jorah, cheekily telling him that it's a good time to talk to Daenerys, as she is in a very good mood. Daenerys tasks Daario and the Second Sons with retaking Yunkai and killing every Master who has taken control. However, Jorah convinces Daenerys to give the Masters an ultimatum: to accept her abolition of slavery or die. She tells Jorah to \"catch Daario before he leaves\", and to send Hizdahr zo Loraq with Daario and the Second Sons as her ambassador to Yunkai.\n\nDaario along with the Second Sons and Hizdahr zo Loraq returns from their successful mission in Yunkai and is present within in the Great Pyramid when Hizdahr suggests to Daenerys that she should reopen the fighting pits. Daario is later seen in Dany's bed explaining to her that he agrees with Hizdahr's suggestion to reopen the pits. He then goes on to telling her about his life growing up as a boy who became a pit fighter himself and how fighting in the pits made him the warrior he is today. He is the only one who will give her honest council. He also explains that a \"dragon queen\" is no queen without her dragons, which encourages her to visit Rhaegal and Viserion, who are chained in the catacombs.\n\nDaario leads Grey Worm to a house where the alleged murderer of White Rat is hiding. He tells Grey Worm that his Second Sons overhear things that the Unsullied do not because they blend in with the local population. Daario is also able to deduce where a member of the Sons of the Harpy was hiding because he also understands fear, while the Unsullied do not. Later, he informs the Daenerys' council that the man they arrested has very little useful information since Daario had questioned him earlier. When Mossador murders the Son of the Harpy, Daenerys has Daario behead Mossador in public, causing a riot.\n\nDaario brings Daenerys the news that Hizddahr zo Loraq, as well as many more supplicants are waiting for her. He states that it isn't neccesary for Ser Barristan to be present at Daenerys's side when she talks with Hizdahr, claiming that he is very much capable of protecting Daenerys against Hizdahr himself, which leads to Ser Barristan taking a walk in the streets instead. He is present when Hizdahr yet again tries to convince Daenerys that the fighting pits should be reopened.\n\nDaario and Daenerys wake over the dead body of Ser Barristan. Hizdahr then enters to offer his condolences. Daario suggests to Daenerys that they could pull back to the pyramid district where they can set up a base of operation so that they can efficiently start working on catching the Sons of the Harpy. Daenerys chose to rather go with Daario's other suggestion, which involves apprehending the leaders of all the great families in Meereen and bringing them to her. Hizdahr states in shock of her decision that he is the leader of his family. Daario nods to the guards who then arrests Hizdahr. Daario is present alongside Daenerys in the catacombs when Daenerys threatens Hizdahr and the other apprehended leaders with the use of her dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion. Daario pushes one of the leaders before the dragons and watches as the master is burned alive then eaten. Later, while Daenerys is talking to Missandei she mentions that Daario thinks she should execute all the Great Masters\n\nDaario is in bed with Daenerys, asking her if Hizdahr will soon take his place beside her in her bed. Daenerys notes a hint of jealousy in Daario, which she finds amusing and sweet. Daario suggests that on the opening day of the games in the fighting pits, she should apprehend all the Great Masters, Wise Masters and all other masters of note and execute them. Daenerys responds in horror of this suggestion that she is a queen and not a butcher, to which Daario replies that \"All rulers are either butchers or meat\".\n\nDaario along with Daenerys, Tyrion, Missandei and Hizdahr are in the Great Pit of Daznak observing the opening match which is set to take place. The match features two fighters: one large man versus one smaller man. Daario states to Daenerys that she should gamble on the smaller man because Daario thinks that speed defeats size in combat. Daario is refering to himself when he says this because when he was a pit fighter himself he was also small, but this never stopped him from winning the fights, even when he was fighting against men that were much larger than him. Daario goes on explaining why this is so while twirling his dagger around Hizdahr's head, which makes Hizdahr nervous. Hizdahr disagrees with Daario's opinion on this matter, saying that in his experience watching the games in the fighting pits the larger men win over the smaller men almost every time. Daenerys responds to Hizdahr by saying that he may not be the right man to speak considering Hizdahr has never fought himself. The fight eventually end resulting in the larger man winning, just as Hizdahr had predicted, which leaves Daario with a sour look on his face because in this instance he was wrong.\n\nDaario along with the others are all shocked when Jorah shows up as the second match is about to commence. Daenerys allows Jorah to fight in the match, and even though Jorah is outmatched for most of the fight he does end up winning the fight in the end. Just after the match has ended, Jorah throws a spear towards the podium where Daenerys is sitting, Daario makes sure the spear doesn't hit Daenerys by pulling her to the side. The spear that Jorah threw was revealed to be targeted towards a member of the Sons of the Harpy who had been sneaking up on Daenerys from behind. Daario looks in to the audience to realize that the Sons of the Harpy are there. Daario manages to fight off and kill many of the Sons that were trying to get to Daenerys. Daario witnesses in shock as Hizdahr is stabbed repeatedly in the chest as they are trying to escape from the podium, revealing that Hizdahr wasn't in league with the Sons of the Harpy after all as Daario had predicted. Daario, Daenerys, Tyrion, Missandei, Jorah and a handfull of Unsullied all run towards the center of the arena trying to find a way to escape \u2013 instead finding themselves surrounded by a huge number of Sons of the Harpy. Daario, Jorah and the Unsullied manage to kill several of them before they eventually realize that they stand no chance against such a huge number of Sons of the Harpy. Just as hope seems to fade away, Drogon appears in the arena scaring off most of the Sons and killing the rest. Daenerys ends up mounting Drogon on the back and flying out of the arena. Daario, Tyrion, Missandei and Jorah all look up to the sky as Daenerys flies away on Drogon.\n\nDaario later strategizes \u2013 or rather argues \u2013 with Tyrion and Jorah in Daenerys's throne room. When Missandei arrives with Grey Worm, Daario throws a few barbs his way before firmly declaring that neither Tyrion \u2013 who has no tracking or combat skills \u2013 nor Grey Worm \u2013 who is still recovering \u2013 can come with them to track the queen down. Instead, Daario declares, Grey Worm and Missandei must lead the Unsullied in keeping the peace, while Tyrion makes sure the city's politics don't bring the pyramids crashing down around them. Daario and Jorah then depart on horseback to find Daenerys.\n\nDaario and Jorah's search takes them to the Dothraki sea. Daario gets Jorah to admit that he is in love with Daenerys, while musing that there is no escaping men like them in the world, and that he would like to see Westeros once Daenerys has conquered it. They eventually stumble across a circle of hoof prints with Daenerys's ring in the middle, leading them to discover that Daenerys has been taken by a Dothraki khalasar.\n\nDaario and Jorah are climbing a hill in order to get a vantage point over Vaes Dothrak, which is where their search for Daenerys has taken them. While climbing Daario continues to make fun of Jorah about how Daenrys chose Daario over him, which keeps annoying Jorah. Upon reaching the top of the hill Jorah lays out a plan on how they are going to rescue Daenerys, a plan which innvolves sneeking into Vaes Dothrak during nightime unarmed, because if they were to get caught with weapons they would be killed (because all weapons are forbidden inside Vaes Dothrak), but if they were unarmed they could pose as merchants. Daario doesn't like the idea of giving up his weapons, especially his dagger, and is very reluctant about it, but he eventually agrees to hand them over. Just as he is about to hand over his dagger he notices the Greyscale on Jorah's wrist, Jorah assures Daario that it didn't touch him and that he is aware of the consequences it brings. Daario and Jorah then sneek in to the city during the night. They eventually stumble across the two Dothraki warriors Akho and Iggo in a back alley. Jorah tries to convince the two Dothraki that they are merchant whom have gotten lost in the city, but Akho doesn't belive their story and orders the other Dotharki to alert the city. Daario chases after Iggo while Jorah tries to fight Akhoo. Daario catches up with Iggo and breaks his neck before he can alert the others. Due to Jorah's greyscale condition he is unable to hold his own against Akho and is nearly killed right before Daario arrives to the rescue by stabbing Akho in the back with his dagger that he had lied about leaving behind. Daario then attemps to cover up the stabwound by smashing Akho's body with a rock, making it look like he was smashed to death and not stabbed.\n\nAs Daenerys and another Dothraki widow Ornela exit the Temple of the Dosh khaleen to get some air they run into Daario and Jorah. Daario seizes Ornela and is about to kill her, but Daenerys makes him stand down. Jorah urges them to leave quickly before the bodies of Aggo and the other Dothraki are discovered. Daenerys however has another idea which involves burning down the temple where all the Khals will be meeting to decide Daenerys' fate. Daenerys enters the temple and after a while of talking she pushes down all the pyres inside causing it to light on fire. Khal Moro attempts to flee out the back door but is unable to because it has been sealed from the outside and its guards have been killed by Daario and Jorah. Daario, Jorah and all the other Dothraki witnesses as Daenerys steps out of the burning temple alive. The Dothraki all bow to her, followed by Jorah, and Daario, who still is in shock of what he just witnessed bows last.\n\nThe morning after the burning of the temple, Daario is present with Daenerys when she confronts Jorah about his recent actions. Daenerys forgives Jorah and welcomes him back to her service, but Jorah refuses her offer and rather tells her to send him away again. Jorah then goes on to show Daenerys his Greyscale infection and confess his love for, which seems to make Daario not jealous but rather sad for Jorah instead, knowing he most likely will die. Instead of sending Jorah away to die, she rather commands him to look for \"the cure\" to his infection so that he can come back to her. As Jorah departs into the unknown, Daario and Daenerys along with the Dothraki start making their way back to Meereen.\n\nOn their way back to Meereen, Daenerys questions Daario on how ships she will need to take Westeros, to which Daario responds that in order to bring all the Dothraki and their horses, the Unsullied and the Second Sons, they would need a thousand ships if not more. Daario goes on to tell Daenrys that she isn't a ruler but rather a conqueror instead as her political rule in Meereen has proven. Daenerys suddenly orders Daario and the Khalasar to stop, and she rides off for unknown reasons. After a long while, Daario announces to the Khalasar thah he is going after her. As he is about to leave, they hear Drogon approaching, with Daenerys on her back. She reveals her true intentions to the khalasar and Daario, who looks at her with satisfaction and admiration.\n\nDaario leads the Dothraki in their charge towards the gates of Meereen to end the masters' siege, removing the head of the first Son of the Harpy he encounters.\n\nFollowing the battle, Daario is summoned by his queen. As Daenerys leaves for Westeros she breaks her ties with Daario at Tyrion's prompting, fearing that bringing a lover to Westeros would be a detriment to her cause. Daario recognizes Tyrion's influence and asks to go with Daenerys, revealing that he has truly grown to love her, but she refuses him. Daario and the Second Sons are left in Meereen to keep the peace while a provisional government transfers power to the people.\n\nDaario is briefly mentioned in a conversation between Daenerys and Tyrion. Daenerys describes Daario as a would-be hero, much like Drogo, Jorah or Jon Snow, who are brave enough to perform heroic but foolish deeds that will likely seal their fate, as if it was merely some kind of contest.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daario_Naharis"}}

The religious beliefs of the Dothraki are complex, as there is little division in Dothraki society between what in other cultures might be called \"religion\" and \"custom\"."],"name":"Great Stallion","description":"The Dothraki acknowledge the existence of other supernatural beings or spirits besides the Great Stallion, but it would be incorrect to describe them as polytheistic. Rather, Dothraki religious beliefs are best described as \"henotheism\" - the belief in and worship of a single deity (the Great Stallion), but accepting the existence of other deities who may or may not be worshiped. These other deities may only have power in specific localities. For example, the Dothraki do not revere or worship the Great Shepherd, the deity of the Lhazareen who live beyond the southern border of the Dothraki Sea. However, they do not deny that the Great Shepherd may exist, they just think its power is only strongest in Lhazar, and even then, that the Great Stallion is assuredly a stronger god than the Great Shepherd, in all times and places.\n\nThis belief system is evidenced in the Dothraki language itself: when planning an invasion of Westeros, Khal Drogo declares, \"Anha aqorisok chiories mori, vazzafrok yal mori, ma afichak vojjor samva Vaesaan Dothrak!\" (\"I will rape their women, take their children as slaves, and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak!\"). The word for \"gods\" which Khal Drogo uses, \"vojjor\", literally means \"statues\" - this word can refer to ordinary statues and sculptures, but can equally mean \"gods\", depending on context (similar to how the English word \"idols\" can literally refer to statues, but may also have religious connotations). As the Dothraki conceive it, every nation or people have their own \"idols\" or \"gods\", but the Great Stallion is the best one, and the only one they pray to. By physically capturing or destroying the religious idols of another people's gods, they believe they are defeating those gods.\n\nThe Dothraki believe that the stars in the night sky are the fiery khalasar of the Great Stallion. They also believe that when they die, their soul will ride with their ancestors in the Night Lands, though only if their bodies are properly burned. Burning a Dothraki's body allows their ashes to rise up to the heavens, where their spirit will join the fiery khalasar of the Great Stallion.\n\nIn Dothraki belief, the moon is said to be a goddess and the wife of the sun, apparently part of the starry khalasar of the Great Stallion. This also indicates that the Dothraki conceptualize the moon as female and the sun as male.\n\nChildren are considered \"blessings from the Great Stallion\".\n\nThe Dothraki believe that a prophesied leader, the \"Stallion Who Mounts the World\", will one day unite all of the Dothraki into one khalasar and conquer the world.\n\nThe Mother of Mountains, a lone mountain located within sight of Vaes Dothrak, is considered sacred in the Dothraki religion.\n\nThe Dothraki are a very brave but also a very superstitious people, believing in any number of signs and omens. A Dothraki khalasar will not go to war until the omens favor it, even if to all outside observers the time seems perfect to strike. Although they will honor agreements they have made, it widely known that the Dothraki \"do things in their own time\", waiting for favorable omens.\"\n\nThe Dothraki religion does not include any restrictions on their lifestyle of pillaging surrounding peoples, killing their men, and raping their women. Nor do there seem to be rules against one Dothraki khalasar fighting another and enslaving the survivors. A successful warrior and mounted raider is highly esteemed.  The closest thing to a priesthood that the Dothraki have are the honored wise-women known as the dosh khaleen, crones who are widows of deceased khals. The dosh khaleen dwell in the only city of the Dothraki, Vaes Dothrak, located deep within the Dothraki Sea. They conduct many religious rituals, interpret all manner of omens, and are held to possess great powers of prophesy.\n\nCarrying a sword or shedding blood within Vaes Dothrak is considered sacrilege, though should the need arise, loopholes such as strangling or burning a man to death are permissible.\n\nThe traditional Dothraki wedding ceremony is a daylong feast in which gifts are presented to the new couple. Displays of personal combat, duels to the death, and wild public orgies are commonplace at such a feast. A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair. Because the Dothraki spend most of their time riding on the open plains, everything of importance in Dothraki culture is done outdoors under the sky. Thus, on their wedding night, a Dothraki couple rides away from the main camp to the open plains, and consummate their marriage under the stars.\n\nThe Dothraki traditionally burn their dead in funeral pyres, so that their spirit may go on to the Night Lands. It is considered a terrible dishonor not to burn a dead Dothraki. The prospect of insects and worms eating through their corpse until it decomposes to nothing but bones is considered quite horrifying. Desecrating a corpse by dismembering or decapitating it, as one would cut up an animal, then leaving the individual pieces to rot, is considered tantamount to killing the corpse's soul itself.\n\nDothraki religion also rejects the employment of blood magic. For this reason, maegi are distrusted and hated by Dothraki.\n\nIn real-life, henotheism is a transitional stage between polytheism and strict monotheism. It can be observed in early, pre-Babylonian Captivity Judaism and other early Canaanite religions. Examples include when the prophet Elijah engaged in a contest with the priests of the false god Baal, or when Moses' staff turned into a snake, and the Egyptian pharaoh also turned his staff into a snake, but Moses's snake ate his. In both cases, the god of Israel is shown to be more powerful than any other local deity, but \"defeating\" a false god is tacit admission that they exist. Strict monotheism was only embraced after the Babylonian Captivity. Even then, it is something of a spectrum, as even modern Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) still acknowledge the existence of \"angels\" as supernatural beings, but which are mere agents of the monotheistic God.\n\nWhen asked if the Dothraki were monotheistic or polytheistic, language consultant and creator of the Dothraki language David J. Peterson responded:\n\nWhen the term \"henotheism\" was subsequently pointed out to Peterson, he said that this matched his earlier observation (that \"this type of belief was quite common to many ancient peoples in our world\") and he responded, \"I think that rather hits the nail on the end. Again, we\u2019d need to wait for confirmation from GRRM, but that gels with my interpretation.\"\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the horse god of the Dothraki is referred to as just the Horse God, not the Great Stallion.\n\nThe Dothraki believe that the first human in the world emerged from the Womb of the World lake near Vaes Dothrak, while riding the first horse, a thousand years ago. The dating of this isn't plausible as, unknown to the Dothraki, the civilizations on Westeros, and in the Valyrian Freehold, have written histories dating back roughly six thousand years.\n\nSeason 2 of the TV series mentions that decapitating or dismembering a body and leaving the pieces to rot is a desecration tantamount to killing the soul itself. In the books, the Dothraki have special riders known as jaqqa rhan (\"Mercy Men\") who after battles ride around the field decapitating the dead and dying. It is unclear how to reconcile Irri's distress over Rakharo's decapitation in Season 2 with the customs of the jaqqa rhan. Given that Khal Drogo's earlier threat focused on leaving his opponent's body to rot, and didn't mention decapitating him, it's possible that the main horror of what happened to Rakharo was that his head was left to rot: the jaqqa rhan apparently take heads as a prelude to burning the body.\n\nWhen asked about this, David J. Peterson explained that the jaqqa rhan decapitate fallen enemies, and thus there is no contradiction:\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Great_Stallion"}}

Tywin ordered the city to be taken and the royal family eliminated in a quick and efficient manner; as a result the city was sacked and the royal family massacred by Ser Gregor Clegane. Upon seeing Tywin's betrayal, Aerys ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin's head and instructed his royal pyromancer to set King's Landing ablaze. Jaime responded by personally stabbing the Mad King in the back. When Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark reached the Red Keep, Tywin presented the bodies of the royal family as proof of his allegiance. After the rebellion, Robert Baratheon took the throne and married Tywin's daughter Cersei to cement the alliance between their houses.","Tyrion is accused of the attempted murder of Bran Stark and taken prisoner by Catelyn Stark. Despite their mutual dislike, Tywin regards any affront to Tyrion as an affront to the honor of House Lannister as a whole and will not allow the action to go unpunished. Jaime confronts Catelyn's husband Eddard Stark who is the current Hand of the King to Robert. Eddard takes responsibility for Catelyn's actions. They fight, but the fight is prematurely ended when one of Jaime's guards intervenes, injuring Eddard. Jaime then leaves King's Landing. Lord Tywin leads an army of sixty thousand men from the Westerlands to the borders of the Riverlands where he is met by Jaime. He commands Jaime to take half their men and besiege Riverrun, the childhood home of Catelyn. Tywin is incredulous that Jaime didn't capture or kill Eddard Stark when he had the chance on the basis that he didn't win their fight 'fairly' because a Lannister man-at-arms interfered. Robert dies after being injured by a boar while hunting and Joffrey claims the throne. Eddard challenges Joffrey's legitimacy and is arrested for treason in King's Landing.","Robb wins a further victory against Tywin's reinforcements in the Battle of Oxcross. Tywin returns to Harrenhal to find his courtyard full of prisoners and Ser Gregor Clegane and his men systematically torturing them to death. He orders a halt to the practice because it is a waste of manpower. He notices a female prisoner posing as a boy. She says that it is safer to travel as a boy and recognizing her intelligence he makes her his new cupbearer. Unbeknownst to Tywin the girl is Arya Stark.","When Tywin intervenes, Joffrey rashly accuses his grandfather of cowardice during Robert's Rebellion. An awkward silence follows before Tywin calmly orders for Joffrey to be taken to bed, despite the King's protests, and instructs Pycelle to sedate him, which further enrages Joffrey.","With his family victorious over the Starks, Tywin has the Stark ancestral greatsword, Ice, melted down and reforged into two smaller longswords, while he personally burns down the wolf pelt scabbard of Ned Stark's sword. He offers the first to his son, Jaime, who has returned from his captivity after over two years of absence. He then tells Jaime that he is making plans to have him removed from the Kingsguard so that he can return to Casterly Rock and rule in his stead. However, Jaime adamantly refuses, believing that if he betrays his oath as a Kingsguard, he will once again be scorned from breaking yet another oath. In anger, Tywin disowns Jaime as his heir and as a Lannister. He allows Jaime to keep the sword, warning him that as a man with no family he will need it.","Tywin is laid within the Great Sept of Baelor, where Jaime and Cersei pay their respects first. Cersei spends most of her time chastising Jaime about allowing Tyrion to murder Tywin by setting him free. She tells Jaime how much their father loved him and how he was always his favorite. Later, Kevan points out to Cersei that the Sparrows would have never dared come to King's Landing when Tywin was alive. Likewise, Loras Tyrell indicates to Margaery in confidence that, with Tywin dead, no one can make Cersei marry him, effectively dismantling the arranged marriage.","While meeting with Yara and Theon Greyjoy in Meereen, Queen Daenerys Targaryen mentions how the fathers of all present in the room - including Tyrion Lannister - were evil men who left the world in a worse state than when they were alive (although Tywin, for all his ruthlessness, was renowned throughout Westeros for maintaining peace through the Seven Kingdoms while serving Aerys II). Daenerys goes onto say how she hopes that they leave it in a better state before finalizing a pact with Yara and Theon.","When Tyrion confronts Cersei in the Tower of the Hand (coincidentally, in the very office that both he and Tywin occupied during their tenures as Hand of the King) she once again blames him for their father's death, claiming that her childen Myrcella and Tommen would not have lost their lives if Tywin had remained alive. Tyrion does not deny his killing of Tywin, adding that to some degree he hates himself for killing his own father, in spite of the cruelty Tywin showed him all his life.","* Appears as a corpse.","Quotes about Tywin:","Tywin pledged fealty to Robert in the aftermath of the conflict, and Robert agreed to marry Tywin's daughter Cersei.

Since then he expressed disdain towards Tyrion for the death of his wife, as well as for shaming Tywin and their family by being born a misshapen dwarf.\n\nTywin insists that all he does is for the sake of his family. Tywin's own father Tytos was a generous and caring man, whose bad investments and indecision made House Lannister a laughingstock. As a result, despite admitting to Arya Stark that Tytos was \"a good man\", Tywin viewed his father's kindness as a source of weakness. Tywin successfully rebuilt his family's fortunes almost singlehandedly, and this along with his total destruction of the rebellious House Reyne caused him to embrace ruthlessness as a principle of keeping one's family in power. This ruthlessness, combined with his efficient, intelligent nature, caused the Mad King to appoint Tywin as his Hand, though Tywin later resigned due to insults by Aerys against his family.\n\nIronically, Tywin's harsh actions and unwillingness to serve as a caring father figure have resulted in severe emotional problems in all three of his children, who are all terrified of him. Jaime and Cersei have been having an incestuous sexual relationship since they were very young, partially due to the lack of any loving parental relationship either of them had. Tywin actually spent most of their lives away in King's Landing serving as Hand of the King, and with their mother dead, his children were functionally raised by servants. Tywin only sporadically visited his home at Casterly Rock, and on the occasions when he did return he would deal out severe punishment for any transgressions his children committed while he was away.\n\nWhat little relationship Tywin may have had with Tyrion was destroyed when Tywin had his marriage to the commoner Tysha annulled, then forced Tyrion to watch as he had his guards gang-rape the girl. Tywin wanted to force all of his children into marriage-alliances to benefit House Lannister (as Cersei was later married off to King Robert), and he was offended that Tyrion risked such a future marriage alliance for himself by marrying a commoner for love. The hypocrisy in this is that Tywin himself married for love when he married his own first cousin Joanna, instead of entering into a marriage-alliance with another more powerful noble family. Over the years, Tywin seemed to develop an outright joy in inflicting petty humiliations on Tyrion, such as \"rewarding\" him on his sixteenth nameday by putting him in charge of the privys and sewers at Casterly Rock. Yet despite all this, Tywin is fully aware that Tyrion is the most intelligent and politically cunning of all of his children. Though this has driven him to despise Tyrion more, given that Tyrion is his least favorite son as well as his most valuable, Tywin has occasionally recognized Tyrion's intelligence by naming him acting Hand of the King and later Master of Coin, and betrothing him to Sansa Stark, all for the benefit of the family. When Tyrion is accused of murdering Joffrey, Tywin's reaction appears to show that he is not entirely convinced of Tyrion's guilt, knowing that Tyrion is much too smart to commit regicide in such an obvious manner, but rather than attempt to prove his son's innocence, he uses the opportunity to rid himself of Tyrion once and for all, either by execution or sending him to the Night's Watch. Though he seems to prefer the latter so as to avoid being branded a kinslayer, it is later implied that this was also part of a plan to push Jaime into renouncing his Kingsguard vows and taking his place as Tywin's heir in return for Tyrion's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Tywin possesses a very conservative, patrician set of social values, in which women are suited to securing marriage-alliances and little else, not wielding power on their own. Thus in contrast to House Tyrell, in which female members of the family are trained in ruling and court intrigue as much as the men are, Tywin never trained Cersei how to rule. Without instruction from her father, because Tywin always disregarded her as simply a means to an end, Cersei turned into a queen who actually isn't very skilled at the art of ruling but who based her reign on her personal vendettas with Tyrion and Margaery. However, on one occasion Tywin outright stated to her that he distrusted her not because of her gender, but because she was not as smart as she thought herself to be. This assessment appears quite accurate, as Cersei's attempts to increase her power following Tywin's death simply left her more and more isolated and despised by the people of Westeros.\n\nOf his three children Tywin has the least shame for Jaime, but not outright respect. Tywin feels disappointed that Jaime wants to continue to be a member of the Kingsguard, as while it is the highest honor a knight can aspire to, it means that Jaime had to swear away his rights to marriage or inheritance, which would leave Tywin's hated son Tyrion as his heir.\n\nTywin does have a generally good relationship with his younger brother Kevan, whom he shaped his whole life to serve as his faithful lieutenant. On the whole, however, for a man who claims to value family above all else, Tywin has hypocritically destroyed his relationships with his own children.\n\nTywin is also shown to have no regard for his grandson Joffrey, knowing fully well that he is incompetent at ruling the Realm. He was shown as having no qualms with putting Joffrey in his place when necessary, normally being cold and blunt with the boy and exerting authority over him when need be. At Joffrey's funeral, Tywin openly tells his grandson Tommen that Joffrey was not a good king much to the chagrin of Cersei.\n\nTywin lacks, or at least overtly lacks, the sadistic and bloodthirsty nature of his grandson Joffrey. Tywin is intelligent enough to weigh political reality against a desire for personal, petty revenge. When Tywin arrived at Lannister-occupied Harrenhal, he put a stop to the pointless torture of captured smallfolk, simply because it would be a more efficient use of resources to put them to work. In contrast, during the Sack of King's Landing he allowed his army to pillage and rape throughout the city, devastating its inhabitants. Underneath his calm exterior, Tywin can be seen to take personal satisfaction in crushing anyone who openly humiliates him (Tyrion, House Reyne of Castamere, Robb Stark, Aerys Targaryen etc.) though he only seeks this kind of vengeance when it is practical for House Lannister. Tywin treated his plans for the Red Wedding as a necessity of ending the war against the North, and he had the Stark family sword, Ice, melted down because it was made out of irreplaceable Valyrian steel which could be used to make other weapons. Privately, however, he bore a look of satisfaction as he personally threw Ice's wolf-pelt scabbard into a fire, symbolizing his destruction of House Stark in the same way he had destroyed the Reynes when they humiliated his family.\n\nDespite his ruthless and calculating nature, Tywin is shown to have a good side if he is impressed with someone, demonstrated when he treats his young cupbearer (unaware that she is Arya Stark) with respect and kindness when she displays knowledge and the ability to read, speaks openly with her and even allows her to eat his dinner when he is not hungry and treat herself to whatever she likes in the kitchen (though considering an earlier \"assassination\" attempt on him, Tywin was probably also being cautious about poisoned food). He also demonstrates this constructive side with his grandson Tommen, whom he knows will become a much better and wiser king than Joffrey, and shares his knowledge and wisdom concerning the duties of a king.\n\nAlthough Tywin's skill at politics and administration cannot be denied, his military record is mixed. During Robert's rebellion Tywin participated in none of the battles except his infamous sacking of King's Landing, when it was already clear that Robert Baratheon would win the war. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Tywin lost his entire fleet to a surprise attack by Euron Greyjoy, and in the War of the Five Kings he badly underestimated Robb Stark and was repeatedly outmaneuvered on the battlefield (though on at least one occasion this was due to an incompetent subordinate). However, Tywin later turned the tables by winning a spectacular victory at the Battle of Blackwater (thanks in part to his new alliance with House Tyrell), and although his actions at the Red Wedding, the destruction of House Reyne, and the Sack of King's Landing were extremely brutal, they produced decisive military results. While Tywin might not be much of a field commander, he is certainly a good strategist: he always has the endgame in mind, and always knows how to best inspire fear in his enemies.\n\nWhile not trusting even his own Small Council\u2014telling Tyrion to execute Varys, Pycelle, or Baelish on \"even a whiff of treason\"\u2014Tywin is also much more diplomatic than Cersei or Joffrey. While he doesn't trust any of the Great Houses apart from his own, Tywin recognizes it as necessary to make some concessions to House Tyrell and House Martell in order to keep their valuable support. Following his death, however, Cersei spurns the Martells and re-ignites her previous rivalry with Margaery Tyrell, eventually destroying both alliances and undoing Tywin's careful work in securing House Lannister.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tywin_Lannister"}}

The TV series vaguely implies that the official symbol is a brooch with a hand on it, though this might have just been Jon Arryn's personal Hand symbol, and Ned Stark simply reused it without bothering to design his own.

Seventeen years later, the elderly Lord Arryn dies in King's Landing. King Robert travels north to Winterfell to ask Lord Eddard Stark to replace him. Eddard is reluctant until he receives intelligence from Jon's wife (and his own sister-in-law), Lysa Arryn, that the Lannister family murdered Jon as part of a wider conspiracy. Eddard then accepts Robert's proposal, hoping to learn the truth about Jon's death. (Much later, Lysa revealed that she herself poisoned Jon, under the instruction of Petyr Baelish, and then sent the letter falsely accusing House Lannister for the murder.) \n\nOn the Kingsroad, Eddard is told that Daenerys Targaryen has married a Dothraki warlord, whose army may pose a potential threat to the realm. King Robert suggests assassinating her, but Eddard dissuades him by noting the moral implications and pointing out that the Dothraki do not have any ships.\n\nUpon arriving in King's Landing, Eddard takes up his role as King's Hand by chairing meetings of the small council. He learns that, despite Jon Arryn's prudence, Robert has put the realm more than six million gold crowns in debt. Eddard also hears reports that the City Watch is struggling to control the influx of visitors to witness the king's tournament in honor of Eddard's appointment. When King Robert announces that Daenerys is pregnant and must now die, Eddard argues against the decision. When Robert orders it done anyway, Eddard resigns the Handship.\n\nAfter being injured in an altercation with Ser Jaime Lannister, Eddard is reinstated by Robert on the condition he makes peace with the Lannisters. He agrees, but then learns that the Lannister bannerman Gregor Clegane has been burning farms in the Riverlands. He sends Ser Beric Dondarrion and a hundred men to arrest Ser Gregor and orders that Lord Tywin Lannister present himself in King's Landing to answer for the actions of his bannerman. The other members of the small council consider this act rash. As well as Hand of the King, Lord Eddard is appointed Regent and Protector of the Realm by the dying King Robert after the latter's wounding by a boar. However, Eddard is stripped of this position by order of Queen Cersei Lannister and the newly-raised King Joffrey Baratheon when he tries to expose the truth of Joffrey's birth.\n\nKing Joffrey then names Lord Tywin Lannister, his grandfather and former Hand of the King to the Mad King twenty years earlier, as his new Hand. However, Tywin is too busy fighting the Stark army under Robb Stark in the Riverlands, so sends his son Tyrion to act in his stead. Furious at Cersei's incompetence in allowing Joffrey to execute Eddard Stark, Tywin orders Tyrion to take the situation in the capital in hand and if necessary to mount heads on spikes.\n\nUpon Tyrion's arrival at King's Landing, his sister disputes his appointment as Acting Hand, but is forced to accept it. Tyrion sets about putting affairs in order. He strips Lord Janos Slynt of his lands and titles and exiles him to the Wall, replacing him as Commander of the City Watch with Bronn. Tyrion then exposes Grand Maester Pycelle as being in Cersei's pocket and strips him of his position on the small council. He also forges an alliance with House Martell of Dorne by pledging Princess Myrcella Baratheon to their youngest son in marriage, to Cersei's fury. Tyrion also sends Lord Petyr Baelish to the Stormlands to treat with Renly Baratheon and make a secret offer to Catelyn Stark, that Tyrion will release Sansa and Arya (whom he does not hold) to her in return for Jaime Lannister's release.\n\nTyrion also attempts to restrain Joffrey's cruelty by being kind to Sansa and attempting to distract Joffrey with two prostitutes. The plan backfires when Joffrey abuses the girls to send a message to Tyrion. However, Tyrion succeeds in blackmailing his cousin Lancel into betraying Cersei and feeding him intelligence about her actions.\n\nTyrion attempts to mend fences with Cersei and work with her in preparing the city for Stannis Baratheon's attack. However, Cersei refuses to talk to Tyrion, even for the city's defense, insisting that Joffrey will handle it personally. Tyrion learns from Lancel that Joffrey's plan is to use wildfire to defend the city. Tyrion heads off the plan - which could burn down the city by accident - by recruiting Wisdom Hallyne of the Alchemists' Guild to his cause. Tyrion believes that he is doing a good job as Hand, but is shocked when he sees a street protest where he is named a 'demon monkey' and blamed for Joffrey's excesses.\n\nHouse Martell accept Tyrion's offer of an alliance and Myrcella leaves the city for Dorne. However, after waving her off the royal party is attacked on the streets of King's Landing by the smallfolk of the city, who are starting to starve as food supplies to the city are interrupted by the war. Joffrey fans the flames of the riot by ordering his soldiers to kill the rioters. Tyrion, furious, slaps Joffrey and attempts to restore order.\n\nWhile sailing to attack Kings Landing in the Battle of the Blackwater, Stannis Baratheon tells Ser Davos Seaworth that should they succeed in taking the city and overthrowing Joffrey, he intends to name Davos as his Hand of the King.\n\nTyrion oversees the defense of King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater, using a wildfire trap to destroy a significant portion of the enemy's forces. After the tide of battle turns in favor of Stannis Baratheon and morale runs low, Tyrion personally leads the city defenders into battle.\n\nTyrion is stripped of his power after Tywin Lannister arrives at King's Landing, relieving Tyrion from his position as acting Hand. In a ceremony in which King Joffrey declares him Savior of the City, Lord Tywin is also proclaimed as Hand of the King. Varys notes to Tyrion that he will not be credited for his actions as Hand, but notes that those who are aware of his role are grateful for it.\n\nTywin Lannister, having resumed his position as Hand of the King, holds a new Small Council meeting. To emphasize his dominance, Tywin has the location of the meeting moved to a new chamber, located just outside of his own, in the Tower of the Hand.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Davos Seaworth was named Hand of the King for King Stannis Baratheon.\n\nAfter Joffrey is slain by Petyr Baelish and Olenna Tyrell, his younger brother and heir, Tommen Baratheon, becomes the new King and names Tywin as his Hand. Shortly afterwards, Tywin is killed by Tyrion, leaving the position vacant.\n\nDuring the first session of the Small Council since Tywin's death, Cersei assumes control until her son, King Tommen, appoints a new Hand of the King once he comes of age. Both Lord Mace Tyrell and Grand Maester Pycelle attempt to convince Cersei to name them acting Hand until Tommen appoints his own but she rebuffs them both.\n\nAfter Cersei's arrest by the High Sparrow, Grand Maester Pycelle sent word to Casterly Rock and offered the position of Hand of the King to Ser Kevan Lannister, Tywin Lannister's younger brother and Cersei's uncle. Kevan promptly returns to the capital to take up the affairs of the realm.\n\nWith the death of Stannis Baratheon and the end of his claim to the Iron Throne during the Battle of Winterfell, Davos's position as Hand can no longer be considered valid.\n\nKevan Lannister continues in the role of Hand of the King until he is killed in the Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. His king, Tommen, commits suicide shortly thereafter. After Cersei seizes the Iron Throne for herself, Qyburn crowns her as Queen of the Andals and the First Men and Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. He wears the Hand brooch, suggesting he fills this role for her.\n\nIn the rechristened Bay of Dragons, Queen Daenerys Targaryen appoints Tyrion Lannister as her official Hand of the Queen, in recognition of his loyalty and good governance of Meereen in her absence. Daenerys presents Tyrion with a replica of the Hand brooch, apologizing that it might not be accurate as she'd never seen the original herself (it appears to be made of silver or iron instead of gold or bronze). Tyrion proudly wears the brooch as Daenerys at last launches her invasion of Westeros.\n\nTyrion settles in his new position as Hand to Daenerys, organising the strategics of the invasion of Westeros. When Ellaria Sand verbally assults Tyrion over Myrcella Baratheon and Oberyn Martell, to which Daenerys calls her out for her disrespect.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hand_of_the_King"}}

It is said that during the The Long Night, Azor Ahai rose up and defeated the Others, wielding a sword of fire called Lightbringer.\n\nDarkness lay over the world and Azor Ahai was the hero chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.\n\nThe second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.\n\nThe third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer.\n\nAccording to prophecy, in ancient books of Asshai from over five thousand years ago, Azor Ahai is to be reborn again to challenge the Others. This will occur after a long summer when an evil, cold darkness descends upon the world. It is said that wielding Lightbringer once again, Azor Ahai will stand against the Others, and if he fails, the world fails with him.\n\n\"There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.\"\n\nSome readers believe that Azor Ahai reborn is the same hero as The Prince That Was Promised, while others believe that is erroneous and that they come from two distinct prophecies. Azor Ahai and The Prince That Was Promised have thus far never been mentioned in the same sentence, although Melisandre has mentioned the prince that was promised and Azor Ahai interchangeably; however, she tends to use the name Azor Ahai far more often.\n\nThe World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) clarifies that there are several mythological or legendary characters similar to Azor Ahai, and that both the maesters and the scholars of Yi Ti believe them to all be the same figure (much as all there stories of the Long Night itself are understood to refer to the same event). Other Azor Ahai figures referred to east of the Bone Mountains are Hyrkoon the Hero, Yin Tar, Neferion, and Eldric Shadowchaser.\n\nIn the third and fifth novels, Melisandre states \"When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. The bleeding star has come and gone, and Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt. Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai reborn!\". While Dragonstone (a volcanic island) can indeed be considered as place of \"smoke and salt\", Stannis was not born there but in Storm's End, and so far has not woken any dragons from stone; Daenerys, on the other hand, was born on Dragonstone, and has hatched fossilized dragon eggs into live dragons, in a miraculous ritual under the red comet at the pyre of her late husband Drogo.

Followers of the Drowned God believe that He brought flame from the sea and that He created the ironborn to reave, raid, and pillage. Much of the religion centers around maritime skills and seafaring ability. It is not simply praiseworthy to kill enemies in battle, it is considered a pious act.\n\nA youth in the Iron Islands is not considered a man until he has killed his first enemy. The religion also encourages paying the \"iron price\" instead of the \"gold price\" -- that is, it is better not to pay or trade for possessions, but to take them by force from the hands of dead enemies.\n\nTo outsiders, the Drowned God religion may seem like a thinly veiled justification for pillaging and plundering, but the ironborn themselves take their religion very seriously, and actually have a fairly well developed cosmology and belief system surrounding it.\n\nWithin this belief system, the Drowned God is locked in an eternal struggle against the Storm God. The Drowned God's halls are located beneath the ocean, while the Storm God lives in a castle in the sky with his thunderclouds. The Storm God is constantly trying to send storms to dash ironborn ships against rocks.\n\nResurrection figures prominently in the religion, in the form of being revived from drowning. The Drowned God himself is said to have drowned in the sea, for the sake of the ironborn, but returned to life \"harder and stronger\". Drowning is also employed as a method of sacrificing enemies to the Drowned God.\n\nDue to their belief, the ironborn do not fear drowning in the sea. \"Godly\" ironborn - that is, fearless raiders - who drown are believed to be taken to the Drowned God's watery halls to feast on fish and be tended by mermaids for eternity. Thus, whenever a man dies, ironborn say that the Drowned God is in need of a strong oarsman.\n\nWhile the Faith of the Seven on the mainland prohibits same-sex relationships (for men or women), it is unclear what the attitude of the Drowned God religion is regarding male and\/or female homosexuality. Yara Greyjoy is a prominent ship captain, and she openly engages in sex with either men or women - none of her followers seem to find this unusual, but it is unclear how typical this is (see main article \"Gender and Sexuality\"). In the fifth novel, Victarion drowned twenty male prostitutes, regarding them as \"unnatural creatures\", but it is unclear whether he acted of religious zeal, or due to his personal opinion about homosexuality.\n\nThe common prayer exchanged by followers of the Drowned God states \"What is dead may never die\", with the responding line, \"But rises again, harder and stronger\". If one person begins this prayer, others are usually expected to join in. The prayer involves clutching the right hand in a fist over the heart.\n\nPriests of the Drowned God are called Drowned Men. They anoint devotees using sea water, which is considered holy water in the religion. Infants are ceremonially \"drowned\" during a baptism rite by being briefly submerged in sea water, or by a priest pouring sea water over their head. Adults may also be anointed with sea water in this fashion, when receiving a blessing from one of the Drowned Men. During the blessing ceremony, the following exchange occurs as the priest pours holy sea water over the adherent's head:\n\nAnother type of drowning ceremony, used to anoint Kings of the Iron Islands, involves the Drowned Man actually drowning someone, holding them under the water until they stop breathing. They are then dragged ashore, where they begin to breathe again. The prayer is extended in this ceremony:\n\nUnlike the Faith of the Seven or the worship of the Lord of Light, the Drowned God religion is rather sexist: Ironborn men are expected to raid, plunder, kill, and command ships, but it is frowned upon for ironborn women to do any of these things. While the Faith of the Seven and R'hllor have priestesses, and the Old Gods of the Forest simply have no clergy at all, the Drowned God's priesthood is all-male.\n\nIt is thus considered quite unusual that Yara Greyjoy, as a young woman, has risen to command her own ship and led men on raids. Further, it is a testament to her popularity with the ironborn men she commands that they would willingly follow her, as she would have to work even harder and be a very capable commander to earn the respect of such men. Despite being a very devout and pious follower of the Drowned God, even Balon Greyjoy himself is proud of and accepts Yara's activities, which are decidedly unorthodox for a woman in his culture.\n\nIn the Iron Islands, it is common to execute criminals by laying them on their back on the beach at low tide, with their arms and legs chained to four stakes, so they can see their death slowly creeping toward them a few inches at a time as the tide comes in - an offering to the Drowned God.\n\nAs with other major religions in Westeros, the Drowned God religion has several basic social rules against incest, kinslaying, and bastardy. It also upholds the laws of hospitality, which hold sacred the good behavior of a guest and host towards each other.\n\nAuthor George R.R. Martin has said that the ironborn are loosely inspired by Vikings, and thus their Drowned God religion is inspired by Norse myths. For example, \"Godly\" ironborn who die are said to feast in the Drowned God's halls under the ocean, which is analogous to Viking belief that they will feast in Valhalla when they die. In Norse mythology, those who drown are said to be taken to the bed of Rán. A stark contrast with Viking belief is that the ironborn consider the Storm God the ultimate evil, the Vikings considered the storm god, Thor, the champion of mankind (Thor was dually a fertility god\/warrior god and most Norsemen were farmers). Like in Norse Mythology, sacred hospitality is practiced. \n\nSeason 5 of the TV series introduced idols of the Drowned God, particularly for use in the House of Black and White in Braavos. The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) actually states that the Drowned God has no idols in his likeness - apparently the ocean itself is all that the ironborn venerate. However, several millennia ago, King Harmund II Hoare married a woman of House Lannister and converted to the Faith of the Seven, or rather his own bizarre interpretation of it. In this interpretation, Harmund believed that there were actually eight gods, the Seven and the Drowned God, and he is said to have decreed that \"a statue of the Drowned God should be raised at the door of every sept\" in the Iron Islands. Therefore, it seems that there are at least some informal depictions of the Drowned God - but since there are no \"temples\" to keep them in (the ironborn simply worship at the waves wherever the land meets the sea), they are not \"religious icons\" used as specific objects of veneration, not in the way the Faith of the Seven uses religious icons. At any rate, Harmund's bizarre edicts were a major blunder because they offended both the Drowned Men and the septons who had moved to the islands, so he had to rescind his order. His son Harmund III was later overthrown in a rebellion led by the Drowned Men (specifically one known as \"the Shrike\"), in which every sept in the Iron Islands was also burned down.\n\nAccording to several comments in blog posts by George R.R. Martin, the Faith of the Seven never had much purchase on the Iron Islands compared to the Drowned God religion, but when it did, it was most often among the thralls of the isles - because the Faith of the Seven preaches against all forms of slavery (even though thralldom is not exactly the same thing as full slavery). This even further encouraged the ironborn's leaders to try to remove the Faith from the isles, because it indirectly (or perhaps directly at times) encouraged thrall revolts. In the current generation, Blacktyde may be the only isle with a sizable pocket of followers of the Seven, as Lord Baelor Blacktyde was sent to the Reach in his youth as a ward, and when he came back he had converted to the Seven\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Drowned_God"}}

He joins Beric Dondarrion in order to help him track down Gregor Clegane on the orders of Eddard Stark.\n\nAfter they were ambushed by Clegane at the Mummer's Ford, the 40 men out of the hundred they had traveled with continued on as the Brotherhood Without Banners. After hearing of the deaths of Robert and Ned, he went back to serving his religion with the rest of the Brotherhood.\n\nThoros of Myr, along with Anguy and other members of the Brotherhood Without Banners, runs into Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie. Interested on how they managed to escape from Harrenhal, he convinces the children to come with them at a local inn.\n\nLater, Sandor Clegane is captured by the Brotherhood, and he reveals the true identity of Arya to them. The Brotherhood tries to convict Sandor of crimes because of his long service to the Lannisters, but know of no evil Sandor had personally done to them. Arya speaks up, and accuses him of killing her friend Mycah. He is placed on trial by combat by Beric Dondarrion. After Clegane kills Beric during the fight, Thoros quickly calls upon the Lord of Light to revive Beric, repeatedly chanting \"LORD cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished, restore it!\", and in a few short seconds, Beric is alive and breathing again, his wounds healed as well.  Ser Jorah Mormont mentions the Siege of Pyke and Thoros's flaming sword when reminiscing about his knighthood with Ser Barristan Selmy. Some time later, the Brotherhood is found by Melisandre, who is looking for a blood relative (Gendry) of Stannis Baratheon, in order to be able to create more Shadows. She is surprised to find Thoros among them, and berates him for giving up on his mission to convert King Robert to their religion. Thoros takes her to Beric, where she examines him and realizes that he has been brought back from death.\n\nWhen she asks Thoros how many times he brought him back, he responds with six. Stunned, she claims that he should not have that kind of power, to which he simply remarks that he has no power, he only asks the Lord for favors, and the Lord responds. Thoros then confesses how he had always had a large lack of faith in the Lord of Light and never took his duties seriously because of them, until the day that Gregor Clegane killed Beric, his friend, and Thoros was called upon to revive him. When he saw that it worked, Thoros' faith was restored. Melisandre convinces Beric and Thoros to give her Gendry in exchange for gold, and because the Lord of Light requires him.\"\n\nArya Stark could not forgive Thoros and Beric for selling Gendry to Melisandre. Later, during her travels with Sandor Clegane, she includes their names when reciting her \"death list\".\n\nWhile witnessing a sermon by a Red Priestess in Volantis, Tyrion remarks that she is much better looking than Thoros, who was the only red priest in King's Landing.\n\nRemembering how Thoros revived Beric six times, Melisandre attempts a ritual to resurrect Jon Snow following his murder, which is successful.  Thoros helps Beric to hang Lem and other two men for raiding a religious community and slaughtering its people, slandering the Brotherhood's reputation. Sandor Clegane arrives, having hunted Lem down for the attack, and demands to be allowed to kill the men himself. When Thoros sees Sandor he asks \"the fuck you doing here?\", mirroring the Hound's earlier words to him. When he is given the permission to kill the men, Sandor moves to use his axe, but is stopped by Thoros, who says that the Brotherhood are not butchers - the men must be hanged. He later tells the Hound that Beric and Sandor have both survived for a reason.\n\nThoros, along with the other members of the Brotherhood travel north, but end up staying at a hut which Sandor stopped in a few years ago with Arya. There, Thoros shows Sandor the power of R'hllor, asking him to look into the fire. The Hound witnesses a vision about the Wall, Wights and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Thoros later helps Sandor bury the previous residents of the hut, a Farmer and his daughter, Sally.\n\nThoros gets taken prisoner along with Beric and Sandor Clegane by the wildlings guarding the Eastwatch castle on behalf of the Night's Watch. After finding them in the cells where Thoros is recognized by Jorah Mormont, Jon Snow frees them to join the excursion team going north to capture a wight. On the journey, Thoros questions whether Gendry is still upset with the Brotherhood selling him. Gendry reveals that Melisandre tried to kill him, which Thoros deduces was part of a ritual that needed Gendry's blood. When Gendry persists in his anger toward them, The Hound tells him that he's just needlessly complaining, and Thoros offers Gendry a drink, which he grudgingly accepts.\n\nShortly after the group finally reaches the mountain peak the Hound had seen in the fire, one of the group's scouts sees a large figure in the distance, much larger than a human. When the creature charges after noticing, it is quickly revealed to be a wight snow bear, which makes short work of the scout. Beric and Thoros both light their blades aflame, and the entire group engages. In the course of fighting the beast, another in the group is killed, and Thoros is gravely injured by the bear when he tries to protect Sandor, receiving severe lacerations on his stomach and chest. Beric uses the fire on his sword to cauterize the wounds, while Thoros comments on how strange his life has become considering he was bitten by a dead bear. Thoros is helped to his feet and continues on, though weakened from his injuries.\n\nThoros and Jorah briefly discuss Thoros' role years ago during the Siege of Pyke, with Jorah fondly remembering the Ironborn fearing Thoros' flaming sword. However, Thoros reveals that he doesn't remember the siege he became famous for, having been far too drunk at the time and only hearing about his great feat afterward. Despite his words, Jorah tells Thoros that at the time he thought Thoros was the bravest man he had ever met. Thoros, with a smile, humbly tells him that he was simply the drunkest, before the two continue on their trek beyond the wall.\n\nThey continue to make their way north until they run into an advance patrol of wights, led by a White Walker. Jon engages the leader, killing it with Longclaw. All but one of the wights shatters. They manage to bind the sole remaining wight and carry it when they are forced to flee to a stone island in the middle of a frozen lake. One of the expedition is overtaken by the running wights and pulled under the ice. The cracking ice expands as more dead advance and fall in. Soon the entire island is encircled by a line of broken ice, so the dead are stopped. The expedition is forced to remain overnight, and it is during this time that Thoros freezes to death, devastating Beric. At Jon's instruction, Beric burns the corpse with his flaming sword to prevent the red priest from returning as a wight.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Thoros"}}

Still, Areo does not pass a judgement on his ruler. When Doran tells him \"Until the Mountain crushed my brother\u2019s skull, no Dornishmen had died in this War of the Five Kings.

He joined the Martell household at Sunspear along with Prince Doran's wife, a Norvoshi noblewoman. He has been a trusted servant of the Martells for many years, and is renowned for his skill with his halberd. Hotah's motto is \"Serve, Protect, Obey\".\n\nAreo Hotah is overlooking the Water Gardens with Doran when Ellaria Sand tries to approach the Prince. Hotah blocks her passage, and tells her that the Prince does not wish to be disturbed. In turn, she threatens him, yet Hotah does not move until Prince Doran tells him to let her pass. She berates Doran for doing nothing about his brother's murder, and tells him that she and Oberyn's daughters want Dorne to take up arms and avenge Oberyn. She also wants to harm Myrcella Baratheon in order to send Cersei Lannister a message. Doran strictly forbids her from harming Myrcella while he rules. Ellaria voices doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing, and then storms off. Hotah lets her pass, yet meaningfully indicates his axe to the Prince, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the Water Gardens.\n\nAs Trystane and Myrcella take a walk through the Water Gardens, Areo and Doran watch over them. The prince tells his captain that they need to protect the two, as a betrothal between two Houses who hate each other will only lead to danger for both of them. He asks if Areo remembers how to use his longaxe as it has been a long time since he used it last. Areo assures him that he still remembers how.\n\nAreo leads the Prince's guard to break up the fight between the Sand Snakes and Jaime Lannister and his accomplice, Bronn, when they try to take Myrcella. Obara angrily claims that they fight for Dorne and asks who he fights for. Areo repeats his command that they drop their weapons. Surrounded and outnumbered, the Sand Snakes obey, though Jaime still hesitates. Areo moves quickly and places his the blade of his longaxe at Jaime's neck, telling Jaime that he would have enjoyed fighting him had Jaime had the use of his right hand. Jaime then drops his sword and the guards take them all into custody. Ellaria Sand is also arrested for her part in the attempted kidnapping.\n\nAreo later escorts Myrcella to visit Jaime in his chambers, saying that Doran sent her to quiet Jaime's concerns about her safety. Areo takes his leave, and Myrcella proceeds to have a tense conversation with Jaime in which she says that her mother doesn't really care about what she wants, that Dorne is her home now, and she still intends to marry Trystane Martell.\n\nOn Doran's orders, Areo frees Bronn from custody and takes him before his lord. On Trystane Martell's request, Areo strikes Bronn across the face in retaliation for Bronn striking him earlier, in exchange for Bronn being shown mercy.\n\nAreo is later present when Princess Myrcella departs from Dorne with Jaime and Bronn.\n\nAreo escorts Prince Doran, along with Ellaria and Tyene Sand to the Water Gardens, assuming a guard posting upon arrival. He watches silently as the prince and paramour exchange compliments and talk of how Oberyn and Doran were well suited for their respective lives. Soon after, Maester Caleotte appears to deliver a message, bearing news of Myrcella's death by poison, which Doran immediately realizes was Ellaria's doing. Before Doran has a chance to react, Tyene Sand stabs and poisons Areo in the spine, killing him instantly in order to leave Doran vulnerable for Ellaria to stab and kill him. From Doran's personal guard, Areo is the only one who is killed in Ellaria's coup, possibly because of his unquestionable loyalty to Doran, while the remaining guards stand and watch Doran bleed to death.\n\nA small justice is enacted for Areo when Tyene is poisoned by Cersei Lannister.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Areo_Hotah"}}

The monarch of the unified Seven Kingdoms sits on the Iron Throne in the capital city King's Landing in the royal palace known as the Red Keep."],"name":"King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men","description":"The title refers to the Andals and the First Men, the two largest ethnic groups on the continent.\n\nThe King or Queen simultaneously possesses the title Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, which refers to the seven independent kingdoms that existed prior to their unification in the Targaryen Conquest.\n\nThe ruler usually also holds the title and office of Protector of the Realm, the commander of the armies of the Seven Kingdoms (led by the four Wardens). The office of \"Protector of the Realm\" is sometimes given to someone other than the current monarch, particularly during a regency when the ruler is under-aged, though if the current ruler does not possess great martial skill he may simply choose to delegate the office to someone else.\n\nSome rulers have combined the two aforementioned titles and have instead held the title Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. Known cases of this include Queen Cersei Lannister and Queen Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nThe office of the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms is often referred to as the Iron Throne, in reference to the eponymous throne on which the King holds court. The position was created when Aegon the Conqueror succeeded in his conquest of Westeros, unifying the independent kingdoms of the Isles and Rivers, the Rock, the Reach, the Mountain and Vale, the Stormlands and the Kingdom of the North. The Principality of Dorne was later united to the realm through marriage-alliance.\n\nUpon her ascension to the Iron Throne, Queen Cersei Lannister was named the Protector of the Seven Kingdoms by Qyburn. This title combines the ranks of Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, and was created by Cersei.\n\nThe King or Queen is formally addressed by his subjects as \"Your Grace\" and in official events referred to employing the following structure: \"Name\" of the House \"Name\" the \"ordinal number\" of His\/Her Name, King\/Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Lord\/Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm\". For example, Robert Baratheon is formally referred to as \"Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of His name\" etc. If a king has not yet reached the legal age of majority, however, a Regent will be named to rule until he comes of age.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"King of Westeros\", and this term does not officially exist within the Game of Thrones TV series.\n\n\"Westeros\" is the entire continent, stretching far north to the lands Beyond the Wall, which are unmapped. The \"Seven Kingdoms\" are the large unified realm which covers most of the continent of Westeros, but which stops at the Wall. After the Targaryen Conquest, the term \"Seven Kingdoms\" became a geographical term, referring to how Westeros south of the Wall used to be divided into seven independent kingdoms.\n\nOn several occasions, dialogue in the TV series has referred to the King of the Andals and the First Men as the \"King of Westeros\", but this is not an official term in the novels. Stannis has been referred to as this a few times in the novels, but it is apparently a colloquialism, not the formal title.\n\nFor that matter, the term \"King of the Seven Kingdoms\" doesn't technically exist either: the proper title is \"King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\" At the least, however, \"King of the Seven Kingdoms\" doesn't lay claim to the lands beyond the Wall.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the full title used is actually \"King of the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men\", Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm\". It's probable that \"the Rhoynar\" was omitted in Season 1 for the sake of not confusing viewers who haven't read the books with too much information, because Dorne and the Rhoynar wouldn't be introduced until Season 4. Corroborating this, very few references were made about Dorne at all before Season 4, compared to the earlier novels which referred to it and House Martell often - the TV series held off on giving this much long exposition, until Oberyn Martell was physically introduced on-screen in Season 4 (though on the other hand, Season 1 didn't actually explain who \"the First Men\" or \"the Andals\" were in on-screen dialogue either, only in supplementary materials).\n\nWhen Season 4 did eventually air, however, the shortened title \"King of the Andals and the First Men\" continued to be used. Even during King Tommen Baratheon's coronation scene in \"First of His Name\", with Prince Oberyn Martell standing prominently among the nobles assembled in front of the Iron Throne, Tommen is still crowned using only the shortened title \"King of the Andals and the First Men\" - excluding \"the Rhoynar\", even though as a Dornishman Oberyn is himself descended from the Rhoynar. However, in the season finale, Daenerys is presented using the full title.\n\nIt would appear that the TV series initially chose to continue using the shortened title \"King of the Andals and the First Men\" because it is what they had been using for three seasons, and they wished to remain internally consistent (the other option was to suddenly start using the full title without explanation, introducing a rather large retcon that this is what they should have been saying all along).\n\nThis isn't necessarily an inexplicable situation within the TV-continuity itself: Dorne was actually independent from the Targaryen realm for two centuries, and when they entered united with the Iron Throne they were allowed special privileges (such as maintaining their own equal primogeniture system, and even styling their ruling family as \"Princes of Dorne\", not \"Lord Paramount of Dorne\". Thus it is possible that, in the TV continuity, the Targaryen kings simply never referred to themselves as Kings \"of the Rhoynar\" as well, even after the marriage-alliance (but still as \"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms\"), to acknowledge the fact that Dorne is still \"ruled\" by its own Princes, even if it is now subject to the Iron Throne (further acknowledging that Dorne is essentially a semi-autonomous region of the Seven Kingdoms). It might have been one of the conditions of the marriage-alliance in the TV continuity.\n\nAs explained in the article for \"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms\", all of the Targaryen kings starting with Aegon I himself styled themselves as \"King of the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men\" and \"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms\" - despite the fact that Dorne remained independent. Aegon I had declared himself king of all of Westeros just before his army even landed on the continent, Dorne included. While Dorne had been able to resist his armies and dragons through guerrilla warfare, Aegon himself never acknowledged that this was a permanent state of affairs. Aegon and all of his heirs considered themselves the de jure kings of the Rhoynar and of Dorne, even if they had no de facto control over it (comparable to how medieval English kings would at times hold titles of lordship over \"Wales\", \"Ireland\", and \"France\", despite not controlling all or even most of these territories). At no point (as readers sometimes have assumed) did Aegon ever \"promote\" the Riverlands into being considered the \"seventh\" kingdom (the Riverlands were occupied by the Iron Islands when he invaded and not an independent \"kingdom\", instead making up the \"eighth\" kingdom of sorts). Dorne was always the seventh of the \"Seven Kingdoms\", the Targaryens just refused to ever officially acknowledge that they did not actually control it - in the novels' continuity. In the TV continuity, therefore, the Targaryen kings may have just acknowledged for the first two centuries of their dynasty that they didn't actually rule the Rhoynar people in Dorne, and that one of the special privileges of Dorne uniting with the Iron Throne through marriage-alliance one century ago is that the Targaryens didn't suddenly add \"King of the Rhoynar\" to their title.\n\nOne notable exception to this occurred, however, when the TV series was not internally consistent and used the original full title from the novels, including mention of \"the Rhoynar\" - in the Season 4 finale, \"The Children\", when Missandei introduces Daenerys Targaryen as \"Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men\". Moreover she was speaking in Low Valyrian at the time, so her lines were actually written in on-screen subtitles. This was not even consistent use for Missandei and Daenerys within Season 4 itself: earlier in episode 4.3 \"The Laws of Gods and Men\", Missandei introduced Daenerys as only \"Queen of the Andals and the First Men\" (again with on-screen subtitles, so this wasn't just a mistake by the actress but in the script). In the middle of Season 4, as already noted, no mention was made of the Rhoynar in the title even at Tommen's coronation in episode 4.5, when Oberyn Martell was standing in front of the audience.\n\nNo official word has come down to make sense of this, but it appears to simply be a mistake by the scriptwriters, i.e. they accidentally wrote the full book-version of the title and forgot their own change to the continuity. This conclusion is reinforced by a comment George R.R. Martin himself made:\n\nThis strongly implies that there was an actual sit-down meeting of the writers back in Season 1 when they formally established the principle that the title in the TV continuity was officially going to be shortened to just \"King of the Andals and the First Men\", and as a scriptwriter in Season 1 Martin was aware of this. The title was also consistently given as \"King of the Andals and the First Men\" throughout Season 5, omitting the Rhoynar. The single use of the full book version of the title in the Season 4 finale therefore simply appears to be a script error and not canonical.\n\nIn the Season 6 premiere, however, Daenerys once again switched back to introducing herself as \"Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men\", without explanation.\n\nAt this point it is again unclear what the title is \"officially\" supposed to be in the TV continuity. The TV writers could have retained the original version which omitted \"of the Rhoynar\", or they could have initiated a retcon by adding in \"of the Rhoynar\" from Season 4 onwards: instead they inconsistently flip-flopped between the two forms. It is possible that the two terms are simply interchangeable.\n\nIn the three hundred years between the Targaryen Conquest and the War of the Five Kings, there has never been a Ruling Queen: a female heir of the current monarch inheriting power in her own right. The first four Targaryen kings all had male heirs who were also their eldest child. However the fifth Targaryen king, Viserys I, only had one surviving child by his first wife before she died, a daughter named Rhaenyra Targaryen. With no other heirs, Viserys I and his court raised Rhaenyra with the expectation that she would be the first Ruling Queen. However, Viserys I remarried late in life, and had several sons with his second wife, the eldest of which was his son Aegon II.\n\nWhen Viserys I died this sparked a succession war between Rhaenyra and Aegon II, known as the Dance of Dragons, which raged from 129 to 131 AL (about 170 years before the War of the Five Kings). Aegon II ultimately had Rhaenyra fed alive to his dragon, but her supporters continued to fight in the name of her children, and not long afterwards Aegon II himself died childless. As the only remaining heir of Viserys I or Aegon II, Rhaenyra's own son Aegon III inherited the throne (Aegon III's own sons both died childless, and ultimately Rhaenyra's younger son Viserys II succeeded to the throne).\n\nAfter the Dance of the Dragons, the Targaryens revised the official royal succession laws to follow an extreme form of male-preference primogeniture, placing female heirs behind all possible male ones, i.e. if all of a king's sons died childless, his own younger brothers would inherit instead of his daughters (their nieces). Such was the case when after both of Aegon III's sons died childless, his daughter Daena was skipped over in succession for Aegon III's younger brother Viserys II. These altered inheritance laws ensured that there was no Ruling Queen in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Many historians point to the succession of Rhaenyra's son Aegon III after Aegon II died as proof of the legitimacy of Rhaenyra's claim to inheritance in the civil war, and while she lived she did personally use the title of Ruling Queen. Officially, however, Rhaenyra is considered a rival claimant and is not counted in the formal line of succession. Any possible future Ruling Queen by the name of \"Rhaenyra\" would be titled \"Rhaenyra I\", not \"Rhaenyra II\". As this would lead to controversy over whether to acknowledge Rhaenyra's claim during the Dance of Dragons, subsequent generations of the Targaryen family simply avoided the issue by never naming any subsequent daughters \"Rhaenyra\".\n\nAt the end of season 6, where King Tommen Baratheon commits suicide after the destruction of the Sept of Baelor, Cersei Lannister has proclaimed and coronated herself as Queen of the Andals and the First Men. Cersei considers herself the first true Ruling Queen in the history of Westeros, but then again so did Rhaenyra - future historians in Westeros will decide if she's just another rival claimant. Cersei claimed the Iron Throne without any legal grounds whatsoever - apparently just right of conquest.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/King_of_the_Andals,_the_Rhoynar,_and_the_First_Men"}}

It is derived from the phrase \"hold the door\", the words that Hodor heard during the seizure that mentally disabled him as a result of the future Bran Stark accidentally warging into his young self during a vision. Nonetheless, House Stark set him to work at a productive occupation within his capacities, as a stableboy serving at Winterfell. Hodor is incredibly large and strong. While he is slow of wits, he is gentle and loyal to the Starks. He is actually Old Nan's great-grandson and only known relative.","Hodor greets the arrival of King Robert Baratheon with the rest of the Stark household when the King arrives to recruit Lord Eddard as his new Hand of the King.Theon Greyjoy directs Hodor to carry the crippled Bran Stark to the great hall to meet Tyrion. He holds Bran while Tyrion offers to give him the plans for a new kind of saddle that he can ride even in his crippled state. Some weeks later, Hodor excitedly bursts into Bran's room with the saddle made from Tyrion's schematics. Hodor bathes naked in the hot pool in the Godswood while Bran prays. Hodor is seen by Osha, who tells Bran that she thinks he must have giants' blood in him. Bran reminds Hodor to get dressed.","Bran dreams that he is Summer, seeing the world through the direwolf's eyes as he stalks through the Godswood and looks up at the Red Comet. He goes to the pool next to the Heart tree and looks down at his reflection. The next day Bran has Hodor carry him out to the godswood; Osha accompanies them and finds a plant that can be used to make a pain relieving tea. She asks Bran if he has had more strange dreams and he claims that he does not dream at all. He changes the subject to the comet, saying that he has heard men say it is an omen favoring Robb in the war. Osha says that she has heard people say the comet is Lannister red and favors their enemies and that she heard a stableboy say the comet was blood red and marked the death of Eddard. Hodor kneels by the pool and Osha helps Bran to the ground by its edge, affectionately stroking his hair. She tells him that stars do not fall for men and that a red comet signifies dragons. Bran stares at his reflection in the water and asserts that dragons are extinct. Bran continues to have wolf dreams. During one, he follows Hodor and again sees the world from Summer's point of view. Summer follows Hodor as he comes to wake Bran up. Bran looking through Summer's eyes jumps up on the bed, and Bran finds himself looking down at his own face. Bran wakes to find himself looking into Summer's eyes with Hodor looking on. Bran discusses his dreams with Osha as Hodor prepares his horse. Bran says that he dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell, flooding the castle and killing his people and killing Ser Rodrik Cassel. Ser Rodrik leads the garrison to relieve the siege of Torrhen's Square by an unknown enemy. The attack was a feint orchestrated by Theon Greyjoy who uses the opportunity to seize Winterfell. Later, Osha kills a guard, then leads Hodor, Bran, and Rickon out the gate, freeing them from the clutches of the ironborn. They travel to a shepherd's farm on the outskirts of the Stark lands. Theon hunts for them with hounds, tracking them to the farm and then losing the scent. He returns to Winterfell with the charred corpses of two boys, claiming that they are Bran and Rickon. He makes no mention of Hodor and Osha. When Maester Luwin sees Osha taking bread down into the crypts, he looks at the bodies and realizes that they are not Bran and Rickon. Later in the crypts, Osha tells him that after they escaped, they doubled back through a stream to mislead the hounds, and have been hiding in the crypts beneath Winterfell ever since. Realizing the bodies were orphans working at the farm and that Theon killed them so no one would know that Bran and Rickon had escaped him, they determine not to tell Bran as he would blame himself. However, Bran, sitting next to a sleeping Hodor and Rickon, has heard them. When the escapees finally emerge from the crypts, Winterfell has been burned and Maester Luwin is badly wounded in the Godswood. He tells them that the children must be taken to the Wall to Jon Snow who will protect them from the invading ironmen and get word to Catelyn and Robb. Later, Hodor is pushing Bran in a wheelbarrow, while Osha carries Rickon, as they head away from Winterfell.","After seeking shelter in a derelict windmill during a rainstorm, the group notice a band of wildlings chasing down an old man. The sounds of thunder terrify Hodor, who shouts out in panic. Fearing discovery, Jojen tells Bran to silence Hodor, who keeps panicking. Bran unintentionally uses his warg powers to render Hodor unconscious. With the wildlings still outside, Jojen convinces Bran to warg through Summer and Shaggydog outside, who then maul to some of the wildlings to death. While in control of Summer and Shaggydog, Bran saw Jon Snow outside fighting the wildlings. He tells Osha to take Rickon with her to the holdfast of Jon Umber, a loyal bannerman of the Starks. Bran bids a tearful Rickon farewell, who leaves with Osha and Shaggydog, while Bran continues northward with Hodor, Summer and the Reed siblings. Later, the group arrives at the Wall and stay overnight in an abandoned castle. During the night, Samwell Tarly, with Gilly and her child, meet Bran and the Reeds in the castle. Samwell, noticing the gigantic Hodor and Summer, realizes who Bran is and offers to take them to Castle Black. They refuse and Jojen tells Sam that they are going beyond the Wall, as no force in the realm of Westeros could withstand the threat posed by the White Walkers. Sam reluctantly gives them the obsidian blades as well as obsidian arrowheads found north of the Wall, which he earlier used to slay a White Walker. True to his gentle nature, Hodor initially does not want to take the blade offered to him, only taking it when directly told to do so. That night, Bran, the Reeds, Hodor and Summer finally pass beyond the Wall.","Hodor is captured by the mutineers alongside his companions when they scout Craster's Keep and attempt to free Summer and Ghost. While Bran, Jojen, and Meera are taken inside the keep, Hodor is chained up outside and abused by the mutineers.

Using his immense strength, the Bran-controlled Hodor lifts Locke off the ground and snaps his neck. Hodor is visibly disturbed when he regains control of his body. He later escapes with the rest of his companions. As the group continues to travel north, they finally arrive to the Heart tree from Bran's visions. The sun is low on the horizon as they approaching the tree, and the group is soon ambushed by skeletal wights. Bran wargs into Hodor again to fend them off, but there are too many of them. As they are about to be overwhelmed, one of the Children of the Forest saves the group with her magic fire balls. Hodor carries Bran into the cave beneath the Heart tree where the wights cannot reach them, and brings him near the Three-eyed raven.","Hodor keeps holding the door to give Meera time to escape with the still unconscious Bran, sacrificing his life as the wights tear him apart in their attempt to break out of the cave.","During Meera's rant at Bran, she mentions that Jojen, Summer and Hodor all died to make sure he survived for the Great War.","Although normally peaceful, Hodor's imposing size, incredible physical strength, and years of service to the Starks have made him a force to be reckoned with whenever the situation demands it. He is able to carry Bran on his back over long distances with no visible signs of fatigue, and (under Bran's control) lift a full-grown man off the ground and break his neck with minimal effort. However, he lacks initiative and does not enter combat unless being warged by Bran.","Hodor is not described in the books as having a large scar on his right temple: this was added by the makeup department of the TV series to hide a tattoo possessed by actor Kristian Nairn. When asked if it was difficult to express a range of emotions when playing a character who can only speak a single word, Kristian responded: :\"Unlike in the book, where Hodor's emotions are portrayed by a combination of the single word, the situation, and the reader's imagination, I have a very powerful medium to use as well: my body language. I was partially deaf when I was a child, and often in school, before I was fixed, I had to read context and emotions from people's faces and body language. That's also a huge part of sign language, and my knowledge of that (although I'm extremely out of practice) has put me in good stead for this part.\"","In the books, Old Nan actually says the reason she thinks Hodor is mentally disabled is because a horse kicked him in the head - though she may have just assumed this because he worked in the stables."],"name":"Hodor","description":"Hodor generally seems to have a happy demeanor, overjoyed by basic things like presenting Bran with a new saddle, hearing the echo of his own voice in a well, or greeting one of the Stark direwolves. He is deeply loyal to the Starks, who have treated him very well, apart from the time Bran Stark unintentionally warged into him as a child to save himself, causing Hodor to become simple-minded. Despite his large size and strength, Hodor is a gentle soul who is terrified by violence - even violence done by himself, as he often cowers in fear instead of fighting back against foes who are actually smaller than he is (something Rast chastises him for). Even so, his loyalty to the Starks is so great that he continues to follow (or rather, carry) Bran Stark through great dangers.\n\nIn his youth, before his fateful seizure, Hodor is shown with an ordinary friendly personality, capable of speech, getting on well with Lyanna, Ned, and Benjen Stark and demonstrating an interest in learning swordplay.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hodor"}}

Eight years before the start of the series, Balon rose in rebellion against the Iron Throne and was defeated in a bloody war. Balon's two older sons were killed and Theon was taken by Lord Eddard Stark as a hostage for Balon's good behavior and obedience. With Yara as Balon's only remaining child in the Iron Islands, he raised her as a surrogate son, encouraging her to become a reaver in her own right, which is unusual for women in the patriarchal culture of the ironborn. She is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship, to the disquiet of some of the ironborn who hold that women should not fight or command men in battle.","Yara assembles her ships at Red Harbor. She rides to Lordsport to reach her fleet and encounters Theon struggling to command his unruly crew. She seizes the opportunity to mock him again. Her men would wait a year for her if need be, but Theon's crew is not loyal to him.","In the letter, Ramsay demands that Yara's father order all ironborn to leave the North by the first night of the full moon under threat of flaying all of them alive and further torture and mutilation to Theon. Balon refuses to yield the lands and castles taken by the ironborn and dismisses Theon for having disobeyed him and for no longer \"being a man\" and unable to continue the Greyjoy line with children of his own.

She rebuffs Theon's labeling her as a woman by pointing out that he is the one wearing a skirt, knowing full well that he has already been berated for it and it will only enrage him. She is a fierce warrior and a staunch leader, and obdurate about her own independence. She does not apologize to her father for leading a personal mission to rescue Theon from the Boltons, despite having failed and lost many men.\n\nBecause of her sharpness, Yara can come across as aggressive towards people she doesn't like or people who try to put her in her place, and isn't swayed when Theon warns her against crossing him. She can be slightly judgmental and labels Theon as an idiot for forgetting that, while he had conquered Winterfell, the ironborn were sailors and islanders and couldn't hold Winterfell for very long. Nevertheless, she clearly loves Theon enough to want to rescue him from Ramsay Bolton. By the time Theon returns to the Iron Islands after Eddard Stark's death, Yara is a renowned leader and, in Balon's words, has commanded and killed men with her own hands. Despite their troubled past, different personalities and Theon's actions, Yara still values Theon's advice, possibly from his experiences in the North and Riverlands, shown when she only agrees to Daenerys Targaryen's conditions when Theon nods at her, and continues to be protective of him, telling Ellaria Sand to leave him alone when she asks him to pour ale for her and then invites him for a threesome with Yara (though it can be argued that Ellaria did not know that Theon had been castrated by Ramsay).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yara_Greyjoy"}}

He and Cersei have three children: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. However, unbeknownst to Robert and most of the realm, all three were actually fathered by Cersei's twin brother, Jaime Lannister. On the other hand, Robert had many bastards from other women, including Gendry and Barra.","Jon Arryn began investigating the lineage of Cersei's children, comparing their appearance to Robert's bastard offspring. He died under mysterious circumstances shortly after beginning his investigation. Robert has decided to ride north to Eddard's keep Winterfell to name him as Jon Arryn's replacement.","On the Kingsroad, the royal party reaches the Crossroads Inn, a noted stop on the way south to the capital. Joffrey was injured by Nymeria, a direwolf belonging to Ned's younger daughter Arya during the halt. Arya is brought before Robert and truthfully blames Joffrey for instigating the incident but Joffrey's falsified version of events is supported by Sansa. Robert appears to sense what is going on and becomes furious that a minor fracas has become a major incident with his wife and his new Hand accusing one another's children; he also appears to exhibit disdain towards Joffrey over the fact his son was beaten and disarmed by a girl several years his junior. He decides to let Ned discipline Arya whilst he will do the same to Joffrey, but to appease his Queen he agrees that a direwolf must be executed. When Nymeria cannot be found, Robert acquiesces to Cersei when she demands that Sansa's wolf Lady be killed instead, infuriating Ned, who carries out the deed himself.","After learning the true parentage of Joffrey and his siblings, Stannis Baratheon has his scribe Matthos Seaworth prepare a letter to be distributed to the Seven Kingdoms. As Matthos is reading a rough draft of this letter to Stannis, the latter orders the reference to Robert as his \"beloved brother\" be taken out since he and Robert never loved each other. When Joffrey hears the \"rumors\" about his parentage as well as the fact that Robert had other children, he realizes that his enemies may think that Robert's bastards have a better claim to the throne than he does. In response to this threat, he orders the City Watch of King's Landing to hunt down and kill all of the bastards. Under the leadership of Lord Commander Janos Slynt, the Watch carry out a city-wide massacre of Robert's bastards, including the infant Barra. The only bastard known to have escaped this slaughter was Gendry.","Meanwhile, Robert's bastard Gendry - having now survived imprisonment under Gregor Clegane at Harrenhal as well as the massacre back in King's Landing - is now traveling with the outlaw group called the Brotherhood Without Banners who ultimately exchange him to the red priestess Melisandre in exchange for two bags of gold. Unaware of what she intends to do with him, Gendry is initially cordial towards Melisandre who reveals the truth about his father as they pass the Red Keep. They arrive at Dragonstone where Gendry meets his uncle Stannis, who refers to his nephew as \"half Robert, half low-born.\" Melisandre later seduces Gendry before quickly tying him to a bed and leeching his blood as part of a ritual to help Stannis's quest for the Iron Throne. However, Gendry is later freed by Davos Seaworth before Stannis and Melisandre can completely sacrifice him thus preserving Robert's bloodline.","When Joffrey is assassinated at his own wedding feast, Tommen becomes the heir apparent despite the \"rumors\" about his actual parentage. As he stands vigil with Cersei and Tywin over Joffrey's corpse in the Great Sept of Baelor, Tywin proceeds to grill Tommen as to what makes a good king. At one point, Tommen asks about strength and Tywin refutes this by pointing out that King Robert was a paragon of strength but ultimately not a good king. He goes on to cite that during his 17 year rule, Robert only attended a scant three meetings of his own Small Council.","Eventually, however, Cersei confesses to her relationship with Lancel to the High Sparrow, saying she was lonely and afraid. When reminded by the High Sparrow that she had a husband, she flippantly argues that Robert was off whoring every chance he got but the High Sparrow shuts her down by saying, \"His sins do not pardon your own.\" He inquires about the \"rumors\" that her children, including the current king Tommen, were not fathered by Robert. Despite his warning that speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime, Cersei continues to lie that her children were in fact fathered by Robert. Though the High Sparrow casts a rather suspicious glance toward Cersei, he relents but informs her that there will still be a trial to ascertain the truth behind the other charges that she continues to deny, including Robert's murder.","In Braavos, Arya Stark witnesses a play mocking the War of the Five Kings as part of a new assignment from the Faceless Men.

Gendry and Jon get along well, as Jon's father (his true parentage still unknown) was good friends with Robert. Gendry accompanies Jon, bringing with him a war hammer with a stag sigil, taking after his father and his father's House.","Robert Baratheon is rumored to have fathered over a dozen bastard children over the years. In her youth Cersei visited a woods witch who foretold that she would have three children (Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen), while Robert would have \"twenty\" (though it isn't clear if she meant exactly, or was using the number broadly). Those bastards who have been introduced in the TV series so far include:","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Robert is in his mid-thirties when the events of the books begin. He is jovial and fun-loving, fond of battle, women, and drink. As a young man Robert was a formidable warrior, noted for his chivalry, sense of honor and immense charisma. He won several loyal Targaryen bannermen to his cause through strength of personality alone. Very tall and incredibly muscular, Robert was considered one of the most attractive men in Westeros, desired by many maidens in the realm. However, after becoming king, Robert let himself go somewhat, becoming fat, soft and indolent, though still capable of great generosity to his friends. Robert has also become more bitter following Lyanna's death and his unhappy marriage to Cersei, despite their multiple children. A great deal of people lost respect for Robert after he won the Iron Throne, dismissing him as a sot, a brute and a drunken fool, Eddard Stark being one of the few exceptions."],"name":"Robert Baratheon","description":"Robert Baratheon, as a young man, possessed the typical talent for warfare and leadership as his brothers, as expected of Baratheon men. He was a charismatic and fearsome military commander and a formidable warrior, shown by his famous defeat of Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, pending the death of Aerys Targaryen. Robert was considered a very good man at heart, and he ultimately was, but people often couldn't see this because externally he appeared to be a brutal, heavy-drinking party animal. He had a fondness for strong drinks, women, tourneys and for extravagant parties, which he heavily immersed himself in after the end of his Rebellion against the Mad King- perhaps to drown his grief over having lost Lyanna. People often commented derogatorily that he was a drunken fool, and failed sometimes to see past his powerful temper.\n\nAdmittedly, however, Robert proved to be a poor peacetime ruler; a soldier more than anything else, he understood nothing about administration, frequently ignoring the sound advice his Small Council gave him. He showed some good judgement by choosing Jon Arryn and later Eddard Stark as Hand, but then unintentionally undermined their good administration with his reckless spending on luxuries and entertainments, which eventually bankrupted the Seven Kingdoms and forced him to take loans from the Iron Bank of Braavos and the Lannisters. It is worth noting that the two men he selected as Hand were two men who had been extremely close to him, whom he trusted, as opposed to men like Tywin Lannister, who would have been an extremely effective, if unapologetically ruthless Hand. Thus, Robert isn't completely prone to errors of judgement. Also, he expressed a certain amount of charisma when he met Ned's children at Winterfell, complimenting Sansa's beauty and even playfully suggesting that Bran would be a soldier. He also showed a good sense of humour in remarking that Ned had 'gotten fat', before raucously laughing when Ned silently indicated that he had done too.\n\nRobert's relationship with Eddard Stark brought out the better side of Robert. Since he did not have a particular fondness or relationship with either one of his actual brothers, he considered the Stark lord a surrogate brother. Ned was the only person who could genuinely counsel Robert on any subject, and the only person he appeared to want to listen to, since he seemed extremely impatient with anybody else, especially his wife (something he didn't make any attempt to hide). Robert trusted Ned deeply and had a very strong sense of empathy and reason for him, assuring him that he only asked Ned to be Hand because he needed him - Robert openly told Ned that he was a loyal friend, showing his extreme admiration of Ned's character. In addition to this, Robert had a deep personal love for Lyanna Stark, Ned's sister, and often lamented about her death, but this lamenting often gave way to Robert intensely tirading about his hatred for the Targaryens - he called Rhaegar Targaryen a monster and scorned him as he believed that he had raped Lyanna, and even after he had vanquished Rhaegar on the Trident, his brutal hatred of the surviving Targaryens. Robert's love for Lyanna went to such a vast extent that, on their wedding night, he visited Cersei in their bed (critically drunk) and openly mistook her for Lyanna, showing that he was unable to accept that Lyanna was apart from him.\n\nDespite plunging into the temptations of drinking, feasting, gambling and suchlike, Robert Baratheon was not a stupid man in some respects. Even years after his climactic rebellion and his famous defeat of Rhaegar Targaryen, Robert still had a sound mind when it came to military matters; he was still able to precisely recite the strategies of the Dothraki if they invaded and provided statistical arguments as to why the Dothraki, with Viserys Targaryen as the figurehead, would eventually gain the upper hand. He was also able to recognize and lament for his mistakes, and apologized to Joffrey that he had never been a particularly good parent. Also, on his deathbed, he begged for Eddard to help him in some way that Robert himself had been unable to, and finally let go of his hatred for the Targaryens when he asked Eddard to do what he could to protect Daenerys Targaryen from being assassinated, accepting that she did not have to suffer for her father and brother's actions.\n\nRobert had a tendency for being cruel or harsh towards Jaime Lannister, referring to him personally as Kingslayer (even though it was Aerys Jaime had killed, enabling Robert to take the throne) and laughingly mocking his status as Tywin Lannister's son forced to guard his extravagant king. He also had the gall to mock Jaime's execution of the Mad King, only to be shocked into silence when Jaime coldly reminded him of Aerys's madness. Robert could be smug, and arranged for Jaime to be on guard when Robert was entertaining his whores, knowing that Jaime (closer than anyone to Cersei) would be aware that this was a vicious insult. However, Robert at least suggested out loud to Eddard Stark that he would even consider naming Jaime as Hand if Ned refused to retake the position. He was also emotionly abusive toward Cersei and had least once, physically struck her though he did feel remorse about it, saying it wasn't a kingly thing to do.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Robert_Baratheon"}}

Tyrion is not fooled by this, but is happy with the development."],"name":"Second Sons","description":"The Second Sons have a long, though checkered history. They are one of the oldest sellsword companies, having been active since soon after the Doom of Valyria four hundred years ago, when they took part in the Battle of Qohor. They were one of two sellsword companies hired to bolster Qohor's defense in the face of a massive Dothraki horde. The Qohorik forces were slaughtered, however, and both sellsword companies broke their contracts and fled rather than face certain death. The Dothraki were miraculously defeated the next day by a force of 3,000 Unsullied - but this did not help the Second Sons' reputation.\n\nOver the centuries they have had more success than at the Battle of Qohor, finding enough steady employment and profits in the frequent wars of the Free Cities that they have been able to remain operating for four hundred years. Like many mercenary companies, they have fought in the Disputed Lands, territory between Lys and Myr which both cities constantly feud over.\n\nIn recent years, however, the Second Sons developed a bad reputation under their captain Mero, a Braavosi known as the Titan's Bastard. As a result none of the Free Cities would hire them anymore, and they fell on such hard times that just prior to the War of the Five Kings they had to travel all the way to Slaver's Bay in search of cities willing to employ their services. By this time the Second Sons consist of about 2,000 armored cavalry.\n\nAfter Daenerys Targaryen frees the Unsullied with her dragons, she starts carving a path across Slaver's Bay, determined to liberate all of the slaves of the region's cities. As she marches on the next city, Yunkai, she parleys with its envoy Razdal mo Eraz. Razdal offers Daenerys gold and ships if she will simply leave Yunkai alone, but she refuses, determined to free the city's tens of thousands of slaves. Razdal warns that Yunkai is not Astapor - though her own advisors say that while Astapor trained Unsullied warrior-eunuchs, Yunkai is mostly known for training bed-slaves. Razdal nonetheless warns her that Yunkai has \"powerful friends\" who will stop her army if it attempts to take the city.\n\nDaenerys, Ser Jorah Mormont, and Ser Barristan Selmy sneak closer to Yunkai to investigate Yunkai's new \"friends\", and discover that they have hired the Second Sons. Barristan feels that their 8,000 Unsullied can defeat them, but that the 2,000 armored cavalry of the mercenaries might be enough to cause them significant trouble. Rather than accept the losses they might cause, Daenerys requests a parley with the captains of the Second Sons, offering to simply pay them more if they switch to her side. Captains Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn arrive at her tent, along with their lieutenant Daario Naharis. She offers to reward them with their choice of lands and castles in the Seven Kingdoms when she eventually retakes them, but Mero and Prendahl are unconcerned about potential future reward. Moreover, they say they can still beat her Unsullied, for although they are outnumbered they have faced worse odds and won - to which Jorah notes that they have faced worse odds and run.\n\nDaario is more diplomatic, and points out that while the Unsullied are impressive infantry, Daenerys has no cavalry forces or siege engines. Daenerys points out that she didn't even have an army a few weeks ago, and a year ago she didn't even have dragons, yet now she has both. Daario is smitten by the young queen's beauty and spirit, but Mero proceeds to be very crass, spewing out a stream of sexual profanity at her. He is so insulting that Grey Worm offers to cut out his tongue, but Daenerys says not to harm a guest while under parley. After the captains decline her offer and leave, however, Daenerys orders Barristan that when they face them in battle he should make sure to kill Mero first, which he says he gladly will.\n\nMeeting in their camp later, the three officers discuss their plan of action. Mero fondles a Yunkai'i whore while fuming about Daenerys's obstinance. They privately agree that they actually don't have the strength to defeat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield, so they come up with a new plan: one of them will quietly sneak into Daenerys's camp during the night and assassinate her, after which her army will disperse. Mero decides that they should draw lots by picking different coins, and Daario is selected for the task.\n\nThat night, Daario infiltrates Daenerys's camp wearing the stolen armor of an Unsullied, and enters her tent while she is taking a bath. He holds a blade to the throat of her servant Missandei, but then explains that he is not there to kill her. He explains that he is so smitten with her beauty that he disagreed with the other officers about killing her: he then unloads the contents of his sack on the floor, revealing the severed heads of Mero and Prendahl. Having thus promoted himself to be the new captain of the Second Sons, Daario pledges them to her service.\n\nDaario, Jorah, and Grey Worm successfully sneak into Yunkai and free enough of the slaves to start a general uprising, after which the city quickly falls to Daenerys's combined dragon\/Dothraki\/Unsullied\/Second Sons army.\n\nDuring Daenerys's conquest of Meereen, Daario Naharis commands the Second Sons to take the Meereenese navy, which consists of 93 ships. When Daario tells the Queen and her council, the possibility is raised of using the fleet to invade Westeros. However, she ultimately refuses and decides to remain in Meereen to rule over Slaver's Bay and enforce her abolition of slavery.\n\nUpon hearing that the Wise Masters of Yunkai have gotten back into power and re-enslaved the freedmen, Daenerys instructs Daario to send his Second Sons to retake the Yellow City and kill every Master. However, Jorah convinces Daenerys to give the Masters an ultimatum instead: to accept her abolition of slavery or die. In order to act as her ambassador to Yunkai, he decides to send Hizdahr zo Loraq along with Daario and the Second Sons.\n\nAfter the success of Hizdahr and Daario's diplomatic mission to Yunkai, the Second Sons return to Meereen to find the city being patrolled by Unsullied as a result of the actions of a resistance movement known as the Sons of the Harpy.\n\nIn order to end the threat of the Sons of the Harpy, who are attacking Unsullied warriors in Meereen in resistance of Daenerys's rule of the city, Daario uses his less-conspicuous Second Sons to find them by mingling with the population. Using such tactics, the Second Sons are able to track a member of the Sons of the Harpy who is captured by Daario and Grey Worm.\n\nLater, several Second Sons are flirting with a Meereenese prostitute, who is secretly in league with the Sons of the Harpy. The Harpies then ambush the mercenaries and lure a patrol of Unsullied into a trap in the catacombs.\n\nWith the slave masters defeated and slavery abolished across Slaver's Bay, the region is renamed the Bay of Dragons in honor of Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons. Having formed several new alliances in Westeros, the Targaryen forces begin to set sail towards the Seven Kingdoms. However, on the advice of Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys decides to leave Daario Naharis and the Second Sons behind, charging them with keeping the peace in Meereen and the rest of the Bay of Dragons until the people choose their own rulers.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Second_Sons"}}

Bran is a warg and currently the new Three-Eyed Raven, using his supernatural gifts to assist his family in the war against the White Walkers.","Bran is the fourth child and second son of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard is the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell and Eddard also holds the title Lord of Winterfell. He is also the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon.","During Robert's visit, Bran goes exploring. While climbing a decrepit tower, he catches the king's wife, Queen Cersei, and her twin brother, Jaime, engaged in sexual intercourse. To keep his silence, Jaime pushes him out of the tower window. Bran survives the fall, but is left comatose, forcing Eddard to leave him in Winterfell. While he is unconscious an assassin attempts to kill him. Catelyn struggles with the man until Summer arrives and rips out the would-be assassin's throat. Summer then stands guard at the end of Bran's bed. Bran awakens with no memory of what happened some weeks later, at the same moment as his father is forced to kill Sansa's direwolf, Lady.","They flee as far as a nearby farm. Theon tracks them with hounds but loses their scent at the farm. He returns to Winterfell with two charred corpses, displaying them publicly and claiming that they are Bran and Rickon. The escapees actually doubled back, using a stream to mask their scent and are hiding under Theon's nose in the crypts of Winterfell. Bran overhears Luwin telling Osha that the bodies must be Jack and Billy, the two orphan boys that he had previously assigned to assist a shepherd.","Bran is on the road to Castle Black , along with his brother Rickon, Osha, Hodor and the direwolves, Summer and Shaggydog, in order to seek shelter with his \"half-brother\", Jon Snow. Bran continues to dream about chasing the Three-Eyed Raven, but encounters in his dream a strange boy, whom he later meets while awake. This is when he meets Jojen Reed and his sister, Meera. Jojen possesses \"the sight\", the rare gift of seeing the past and present through his dreams, and is able to speak with Bran through their dreams. Jojen also saw the Three-Eyed Raven, who is apparently responsible for bringing the sight to them, and tells Bran he is a 'Warg', someone who can control the minds of animals. Osha is distrustful of the siblings.","Later, Bran and his companions are resting near Craster's Keep. They hear the faint sounds of a baby's cries. Bran enters the mind of Summer to investigate where he finds Ghost, the direwolf of Jon Snow. However, before he can free Ghost, Summer is caught by a trap. Against Meera's urgings, they go to rescue Summer and Ghost but are taken prisoner by Karl. While Hodor is being tormented by Rast and the other mutineers for pure amusement, Karl threatens to kill Jojen and Meera before Bran gives up his identity.","Bran is still largely believed to have died along with Rickon at the hands of Theon. When Sansa Stark returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay at the behest of Petyr Baelish, Ramsay initially forces Theon to keep up the charade and apologize to Sansa. Eventually, however, an irate Sansa forces Theon to finally admit that he did not kill her brothers. Stunned by this admission, her anger towards Theon cools but when she asks if he knows where they might have gone to, he breaks down and leaves the room, fearful of what Ramsay will do if and when he finds out what he just told her. However, Sansa appears to be left with a sense of renewed hope by the revelation that she still has surviving family left.","Benjen takes Bran and Meera to a Weirwood beyond the wall, and explains that he cannot pass due to magic used during the building of the Wall to make sure the dead can't go beyond it. He then rides off, leaving Bran and Meera alone by the weirwood. Bran sees the weirwood, and begins to crawl over to it. Meera asks him if he is ready, and he replies that he is now the Three Eyed Raven - he has to be ready. He then places his hand on the tree and returns to his vision in the Tower of Joy. Following his father inside, he watches him find Lyanna in a bed of her own blood. She whispers to him and reveals she has just given birth to a newborn son by her alleged kidnapper Rhaegar Targaryen, and implores Ned to protect him from Robert Baratheon.

As David Benioff explained, Bran simply caught up with his material from the most recent book, and his arrival at the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven was a good stopping point, so it made more sense to just take a year off from his storyline to focus on other sub-plots which are also competing for time:","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Bran is seven years old when the action begins. He has a love of climbing, and has been known to climb the walls of Winterfell and go exploring its ancient nooks and crannies. He dreams of one day being a great knight, but he is also fascinated by magic. Bran is described as having red-auburn hair like his mother, full brothers, and oldest sister, though on the series he has brown hair. Robb Stark's hair was also similarly darkened for the television series, while Rickon's is lightened to blond."],"name":"Bran Stark","description":"Before the incident of his fall, Bran was an extremely curious and adventurous boy. He was noted by his mother, and by his brother Robb, to have done a great amount of climbing around the walls of Winterfell and having never fallen, showing a considerable amount of bravery on his part. His curiosity was majorly what led to his fall in the first place, since he was drawn into the encounter between Jaime and Cersei out of sheer curiosity as to what was happening. After his fall, Bran turned towards melancholy, citing that he would rather be dead than be unable to walk, distressing Robb upon hearing Bran say so. This factor is to be expected, because Bran had a previously extremely adventurous nature and couldn't bear to be unable to continue that way. However, Bran became happier once Tyrion gave him the designs for a special saddle, since he also loved riding as much as he did climbing. Bran had it in him to be a good lord in his own right, as proven by his brief tenure as acting Lord of Winterfell when Robb left to fight Tywin Lannister.\n\nAfter Theon Greyjoy betrayed his house and seized Winterfell, Bran's innocence proved to be a disadvantage for him, since Theon coerced him into surrendering Winterfell under the promise that nobody would be harmed. Bran proved unable to predict that Theon, under excruciating pressure from his bad reputation among the ironborn, would break his word the moment somebody openly defied him. Bran was a compassionate young man, still, and pleaded tearfully when Theon ordered for Ser Rodrik Cassel to be executed. Upon meeting Jojen Reed, however, Bran proved capable of accepting the powers that he possessed, showing an open mind on his part, even if such a thing set him apart from companions like Osha. He became almost unbreakably determined to meet the Three-Eyed Raven that kept coming to him in his dreams, even if it meant separating from his brother Rickon and, later on, from Jon Snow (who would have protected him at Castle Black). When Bran finally reached the Three-Eyed Raven, one of the first things he pressed the Three-Eyed Raven about is whether or not Bran could walk again, and is briefly disappointed when told that he will never walk again.\n\nAfter growing up under the tutelage of the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran maintains his curious nature, especially when he and the Raven visit Winterfell; his curiosity piques when he sees his long-dead aunt Lyanna. Bran is disappointed by the prospect of returning to the real world. Later on, Bran expresses confusion when witnessing the duel at the Tower of Joy, especially when his young father started losing the duel - this confusion turned to horror when he realised that Arthur Dayne lost because Howland Reed blindsided him, having been told all his life that Ned ultimately killed the man in an honourable duel. This horror resurfaced when he realised that the Children of the Forest were responsible for the creation of the White Walkers, only to be silenced when Leaf cited the havoc caused by men to be the main reason for this course of action. He also shows incredulity at what his own powers can accomplish, as shown when he realises how he is responsible for breaking Hodor's mind in the first place.\n\nUpon returning from Beyond the Wall, Bran's personality has changed significantly, as a result of the expansion his powers have taken since the battle at the Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven. He has become extremely calm to a fault, to the point of being almost detached from everyone else around him. Having become the new Three-Eyed Raven, Bran has been given access to many more events, which he explains several times, so much that Bran becomes aware of almost anything, for example the wedding between his sister Sansa and Ramsay Bolton, and even the conversation between Littlefinger and Varys. Bran has become almost wiser than he was before, ultimately not accepting the Valyrian steel dagger that Littlefinger gives him, citing that it would be useless for a cripple, but at the same time obviously not trusting the gifts that the man gives him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bran_Stark"}}

Ethan and his twin sister Talia both shared a great love for the towering trees of Ironrath. He was young when his house joined the War of the Five Kings, and the end of the war placed him into a role which he was unprepared for.\n\nEthan was once tormented by a miller's boy, and while his mother wanted to intervene, his father wanted him to fight his own battles. His brother Asher, however, had none of it and grabbed the miller's boy by his neck and knocked half of his teeth out. Gregor was furious, but all Asher cared about was his little brother.\n\nAfter his father is killed and oldest brother Rodrik Forrester is presumed dead during the events of the Red Wedding, young Ethan officially becomes the new head of House Forrester, (though it is assumed he was still the acting Lord throughout the course of the war. It could also have been Duncan Tuttle, the castelan, and Lady Forrester), when House Bolton is enforcing its new Lannister-backed rule of the North. Ethan succeeds despite being the third son because second son Asher Forrester was exiled some years before.\n\nEthan is first seen playing in the ironwood grove with his siblings Talia and Ryon. He is hiding from the two behind tree. Talia scans the area and remarks that if he was smart he would reveal himself, while Ryon states he doesn't like the game anymore because they can't find Ethan. His hiding spot is revealed, and he comforts Ryon. Ryon begins to speak about everyone who he misses, his siblings and Gared Tuttle, who was recently sent to the Wall.\n\nThey discuss Gared's fate, and how Ser Royland Degore was worried about him because he believes Ethan can't fight well, and called him a milksop. Talia recommends that Ethan let him teach him how to fight, as he taught Rodrik, Asher, and even herself how to fight. Ryon agrees, believing a lord should know how to fight.\n\nTalia begins to reminisce about how Rodrik, Asher, Ethan, and her used to play in the grove for hours, but Rodrik became serious and Asher became angry. She asks Ethan to not be like that, but be the way he already is. Ethan can promise not to change or state that he may have to.\n\nSer Royland calls out, stating that Ethan is need in the great hall immediately, as Lord Ludd Whitehill has arrived unannounced and unexpectedly. His siblings beg him to stay, and even if the player chooses to stay in the grove, Ethan goes to the meeting.\n\nDuncan Tuttle and Ser Royland brief Ethan. Royland wishes to be decisive and firm, ordering him to leave and not give him any satisfaction, while Duncan wishes him not to provoke the Whitehills. Lord Whitehill and his men enter. Lord Whitehill begins giving him condolences for his late father and brother, although they weren't his friends. He raises his hands to be shaken, which Ethan can do, ignore it, or thank him. Regardless, the rival lord proclaims that his only regard that he wasn't there to drive the dagger into his heart himself.\n\nLudd announces that the Forresters finally got their due. Ethan responds to this, before Ludd rants on how the house received him with no bread and salt. Ethan also answers this, possibly angering him even more. Royland and Lord Whitehill share a glare before Duncan reminds Ethan that he's losing control. Ethan redirects Ludd's attention back to himself, and asks why exactly he's here.\n\nA Whitehill man-at-arms, Britt Warrick comes forward and explains his encounter with Gared, stating how they were attacked for no reason. When Ludd asks how Ethan answers for his men, Ludd is angered further, he questions on the whereabouts of Gared. After hearing what has happened Lord Whitehill, angrily proclaims he's not leaving until he gets his justice, and unless they bring the coward who did it they'll answer to Roose Bolton. Ethan's mother, Lady Elissa Forrester intervenes, calming Ludd. He apologizes, but turns back to Ethan, proclaiming it's not over. Ethan declares it's over, and Elissa reminds that Ethan is Lord of Ironrath and that his word is law there. Ludd reminds him that Lord Bolton will have the final say, asserting that he will tell Roose that a Forrester man killed one of his own, and that the new Lord Forrester lied to his face and denied him his justice before leaving.\n\nAfter the Whitehills leave, Royland either remarks that he was wrong about Ethan and he stood up to him like a true lord, or Duncan will remark that Ethan acted wise. Lady Forrester adds that he was brave, but he'll need to be braver when Ramsay Snow, comes to see him bend the knee.\n\nLater, in one of the wooden towers of Ironrath, Maester Ortengryn follows him disclosing that he is young and there are those that are uncertain of his leadership, but relates that three hundred generations of Forrester lords stand behind him, and speaks of his ancestors, such as Gerhard the Tall, the founder of the house and his grandfather Thorren the Bold, who seized back the river valley from the Whitehills. Ethan asks about his father, who Ortengryn affirms will be known as Gregor the Good.\n\nAs Ethan looks over the smallfolk and Forrester men train, Ortengryn tells him that they were his father's people to lead and protect, but now they're his. The maester then informs him that his father and all of the previous lord had one man he trusted above all overs: his Sentinel and that Ethan must now choose a Sentinel. Before their conversation can continue, they hear Ser Royland yelling, and look down to see him kicking a man with chains to the ground, and asks to summon Ethan.\n\nEthan comes down, and Royland explains that the man, Erik, is a thief and deserter, who they caught stealing weapons when he was supposed to be guarding them. Erik rants on how they haven't been paid and their lot of bread and wine grows smaller everyday, before Royland silences him. Duncan, Royland, and Ethan meet, where they discuss the punishment. Royland reminds him that his father took three of a thief's fingers, while Duncan notes the men are on edge, while Royland replies that the men must know they can't do whatever. Duncan says he could send him to the Wall. Ethan turns toward the thief, and either takes three fingers, which Royland or him will carry out, send him to the Wall, or gives him mercy.\n\nAfter the punishment is meted, Ortengryn comforts Ethan, and notes that a Sentinel could help him in these kinds of situations. He gives Ethan the Bracer of the Sentinel and reminds him that tonight is his first small council meeting and it would be wise to give the bracer then.\n\nHe goes to discuss the matters with Duncan and Royland, who both praise themselves and recommend they become Sentinel. Royland tells Ethan of their defenses, and recommends they put everyone that can hold a spear on the wall to intimidate them when they arrive, while Duncan talks about their food supplies, and offers that they could demand food from the smallfolk. Ethan also goes to talk to Ryon, who is carving a sword which he calls \"Two Brothers\" because it has Ethan's and Rodrik's name on it. Ryon states that one day he'll have a real one, he then asks if Erik was a bad man. He says that people who do bad things need to be punished, and that someone did something bad to his father and Rodrik and someone should do something worst to them.\n\nHe visits his uncle Malcolm Branfield, who is in the stable preparing his horse. He recommends that Ser Royland should be the Sentinel, because he needs a warrior at his side, he's and explains that he is preparing for a journey across the Narrow Sea to retrieve Asher. Talia comes and briefly talks with Ethan, informing if Mira did or didn't ask for help from Lady Margaery, but comforts him on his decision, and can be asked who should be Sentinel, to which she names Duncan, who's wise and fair. Before Ortengryn convenes the small council meeting, he can be asked about the ironwood, which he believes is their gold. He recommends that they could give the Boltons ironwood and they'll leave them alone.\n\nThe small council meeting begins. The maester, Lady Forrester, Ser Royland, and Duncan are all present. Ethan first names his Sentinel, much their happiness and the other's dismay. The Sentinel reports of Ramsay Snow, alerting them that he is a day's ride away. Lady Forrester believes they should prepare for the worst, while Ortengryn argues that the Boltons need them to harvest ironwood. Royland interjects, demanding they answer with the sword. Duncan either attempts to silence him with his Sentinel status, or Royland does the same to him. Ethan settles it. Duncan wishes to be diplomatic, but Royland states that the Bolton sigil is a flayed man. Lady Forrester interrupts, stopping the bickering and asks Ethan to devise a plan to deal with Ramsay, because Mira's efforts, if asked, are not guaranteed to succeed.\n\nOrtengryn wishes to make an offering of ironwood for peace, Royland wants to fight, while Duncan wants to use diplomacy. Ethan selects a plan of action. After this is selected, Royland recommends that they position their forces at the gate and they make Ramsay wait at the gate and only let him in because Ethan allowed it. Alternatively, Ethan can choose to meet Ramsay in the great hall. He also deals with the man who was not chosen to be the Sentinel.\n\nAfter the rest of the council leaves, Lady Forrester speaks with her son. She tells him of his exiled brother Asher, how he can help them. She explains his skilled fighting skills, and his hunger for it. She also reminds him of the miller's boy, and what Asher did to protect Ethan. Malcolm comes in, and Lady Forrester pleas for Ethan to allow him to go to Essos. Ethan selects his decision.\n\nBefore the meeting, Ethan is informed that Mira could not get help from Mira if she asked. Ryon, Talia, Lady Forrester, and Ethan's Sentinel are present waiting for Ramsay.\n\nIf Ramsay is to met at the gate, he is annoyed that it is down. Ethan lets him and Lord Whitehill. He is given an ironwood shield, which he tests. He gazes on the smallfolk and Forrester men, before entering the great hall. If he is to be met in the great hall, the ironwood shield will be tested by him in there.\n\nIn the great hall, Ramsay asks Ethan to bend the knee, and Ethan can choose to do so or not. They begin to discuss the fate of the Forrester's Ironwood supply. He splits it 50\/50 with the Whitehills to see who fares better. He also orders a garrison of twenty Whitehill men at Ironrath. Things seem to be going well until Ramsay begins to toy with Ethan's siblings, Talia and Ryon. Ethan convinces him to stand down (unless he was only provoking him to see what Ethan will do) and Ramsay seems to pull back. However, Ramsay suddenly stabs Ethan in the neck--leaving a fatal wound, and leaving no official heir as Ryon is taken as a ward by the Whitehills.\n\nTalia tells their brother Rodrik (who is revealed to have survived the Red Wedding) about Ethan's death.\n\nHis corpse is later seen on an Ironwood casket with his father on another one next to him. When the funeral starts, Rodrik will give a eulogy to his little brother before alighting his body. With the cremation taking place, Talia sings of losses of the two fallen lords.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Bastards, Ethan is finally avenged when Sansa Stark feeds Ramsay to his own hounds.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ethan_Forrester"}}

He mentions that he \"hears all sorts of things\" as a coal boy, and leaves Mira's chambers.\n\nTom later appears after Mira's request for Margaery's help in supporting her house is denied. He offers to help Mira by providing information, saying that there are those in King's Landing who would be willing to support her.\n\nTom appears at the beginning of the episode delivering a letter to Mira Forrester from her mother, requiring Margaery's influence to betroth Elaena Glenmore to Rodrik Forrester.\n\nTom again appears at the end of the episode, hearing screaming he rushes to where Damien has nearly choked Mira to death, he hits Damien on the head which causes him to bleed and throw his intentions of killing Mira to him instead.\n\nThe player can then order Mira to attack Damien with the knife, thus killing him or running away, leaving Tom alone to fight with Damien, later, telling Mira in the next episode that he killed Damien with a rock.\n\nKilling Damien will have the two engage in a conversation about how Tom found her hearing screaming, he then drags Damien's body away, knowing that he can get rid of the body to where no one will be able to find the corpse.\n\nSera and Mira walk through the gardens of King's Landing, discussing the upcoming wedding. Sera points out a lord she is planning to court and asks Mira to cover for her while she talks to him. During her absence Mira has the option of speaking with Tom about the Lannister guard, Damien.

Tom suggests that Mira get herself into Tommen's coronation feast to speak to Lords Andros and Morgryn, the ironwood merchants hired by Lord Whitehill, in order to get more information.

Stannis fought for Robert during the war. He was besieged at Storm's End for much of the conflict. He was rescued from starvation by the smuggler Davos, who brought a ship full of onions into the castle. Stannis knighted Davos as a reward but also punished him for his smuggling by cutting four finger tips from his right hand. Davos is fiercely loyal to Stannis and saw his punishment as just. Davos's son Matthos served Stannis as a scribe. Stannis went on to conquer Dragonstone, the seat of House Targaryen. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.","Varys tells Eddard that Queen Cersei is more concerned about Stannis than anyone else, including the army that Robb Stark has raised. Stannis is a proven and experienced battle commander and is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies. Eddard replies that Stannis is the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne, to Varys' disappointment.","Stannis returns to Dragonstone and confronts Melisandre about the validity of her predictions. He begins to strangle her in fury but relents when she reminds him of the spell they used to kill Renly. He experiences remorse of murdering his brother. Melisandre warns him that he will commit worse betrayals before their long war is over but insists that he must fight on and assures him that it will be worth it in the end, because he will be king. She shows him a vision in the flames that awes him and restores his faith in her.","Later, Stannis visits Davos in his cell. Davos protests that Gendry is an innocent who has never done him any wrong, but Stannis argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory, which Stannis believes is the only way to save every man, woman, and child in Westeros from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path, and asks how Davos can doubt the power of Melisandre's god when Stannis has seen visions of \"a great battle in the snow\" and Davos saw the creature she gave birth to. Davos speculates that the real reason Stannis came is because deep down, a part of him knows what he's about to do is wrong, and he knew Davos would tell him the truth he needs to hear, regardless of how it would be taken. After extracting a promise from Davos that he won't act against Melisandre again, Stannis has Davos released.","After being granted an audience with the Iron Bank of Braavos, Stannis and Davos travel to Braavos, where they meet with Tycho Nestoris. Although at first dismissive of Stannis's claim due to his inferior army and his lack of resources to repay any debts to the Bank, Davos defends Stannis as the only one able to repay the debts, both that he takes and those of the Iron Throne. Davos's plea insists that Stannis always pays up and that the Lannisters will be faced with a power vacuum when Tywin Lannister (who is 67 years old) dies and that, if such a moment occurred, the Bank wasn't likely to see a return on its investment in Westeros. The bankers decide to grant Stannis his loan and their support, allowing Davos to once again hire Salladhor Saan into their service. Meanwhile, back in King's Landing, Tyrion Lannister is on trial for murdering King Joffrey. Enraged at the injustice, he hisses at the audience: \"I should have let Stannis kill you all.\" On the day after the Battle of Castle Black, Stannis arrives with his army to fight the wildlings. His attack interrupts Jon's meeting with Mance Rayder and actually saves his life. Mance's forces surrender to the Baratheon army, and Stannis is introduced as the true King of the Seven Kingdoms. Mance points out that they are outside the Seven Kingdoms. Stannis also demands that Mance and his forces kneel, as it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a King. Mance refuses, saying that Free Folk do not kneel, knowing that Stannis will kill him if he does not. Davos asks Jon what a member of the Night's Watch is doing in the camp, away from the wall, and Jon explains that he came to treat with the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Jon introduces himself as Ned Stark's bastard son and acknowledges that Stannis is the true king, as his own father died supporting the claim. Out of respect for Ned, Stannis takes Jon seriously, asking him what his father would do with Mance. Jon responds that he was once a prisoner of Mance's, and that he could have killed him or tortured him but instead spared his life; in turn, his father would spare Mance in the situation. However, he urges to Stannis that they should burn the dead, to avoid them returning as wights. Later, Stannis is present at the Watch's funeral for their fallen brothers.","Although Stannis was not pleased that Jon interfered with Mance's execution, he presents Jon an enticing offer. If Jon bends the knee and swears his loyalty to Stannis, the king will legitimize him as Jon Stark, making him the Lord of Winterfell. Stannis, after receiving a message from Lyanna Mormont, knows that having a Stark on his side is the best chance of rallying the Northerners to his cause. Jon is tempted by the offer, since he wanted to be a true Stark since he was a boy, but he tells Samwell Tarly that he intends to refuse the offer.","Though gone, Stannis's failed attack on Winterfell ultimately leads to House Bolton's downfall, having enabled Sansa to escape, reach Jon and for the two of them to rally an army to liberate the castle and return it to House Stark, signifying that Stannis's death was ultimately not in vain.","Samwell Tarly mentions that Stannis talked about an underground mountain of dragonglass underneath Dragonstone during his stay at Castle Black.","Spoken of Stannis","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Stannis is a very different man to his two brothers. While they are handsome, jovial, charismatic, and bold, Stannis is colder, more logical, and reserved. He acts only after much forethought and planning. Stannis lacks passion and, while not engaging in wanton cruelty, is merciless to those he considers his enemies. Stannis has an absolute belief in law and duty, and joined his brother's rebellion against the Targaryens only after much soul-searching."],"name":"Stannis Baratheon","description":"Stannis was a cold, hard, serious, stubborn, firm and rarely-forgiving man but also brave and in possession of an immense sense of duty. As is expected of Baratheons, Stannis was proven on the battlefield as both a commander and warrior. He had a keen mind for strategy and warfare that led him to be respected by many high-lords and was also fearless in combat, where he could battle and defeat other soldiers, even when injured or unarmoured. While he may not be popular, he is certainly respected as a warrior and commander.\n\nStannis led at the front lines alongside his troops to inspire them on many occasions. His military record prior to the War of the Five Kings was exemplary; he held Storm's End against an overwhelming siege for much of Robert's Rebellion and captured Dragonstone at its conclusion, and he achieved two crucial victories during the Greyjoy Rebellion. His ambush against Mance Rayder's army was also a decisive victory, despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered. Stannis's only two major defeats were at the Battle of Blackwater (where he was attacked on the flank by unexpected Lannister-Tyrell reinforcements) and the Battle of Winterfell (where Stannis's stubborn desire to give battle in spite of the odds doomed him and his army)\n\nWith regard to his brothers, Stannis was in better control of his emotions in comparison to the temperamental Robert and youthful Renly, whereas he always appeared calculating and stoic, repressing his emotions and desires for most of his life for the sole objections of the greater good. Even when fully prepared to vent his emotions, he is able to retain his composure and dignity, even when he is about to be executed. Stannis has very little patience for false politeness that is expected of a lord in court and generally states his opinions of others or what is on his mind aloud. Because of this he does not surround himself with sycophants as Cersei does but with advisors whom he trusts to be blunt with the truth, whether he may object to it or not.\n\nStannis has an unbreakable code of honor and sense of duty and justice which governs his actions. He supported his brother in Robert's Rebellion and fought bravely to put down the Greyjoy Rebellion. When a newly-crowned Robert granted dominion of the much larger wealthier storm lands to Renly and left Stannis with Dragonstone, Stannis accepted his brother's wishes. During the Siege of Dragonstone, Stannis held out against the Tyrells despite the hunger, hopelessness and overwhelming numbers they faced. When Davos finally managed to smuggle food into the castle, Stannis made sure his men were fed first before feeding himself. He then rewarded (and punished) Davos fairly, which impressed the smuggler and earned his admiration.\n\nAfter learning that Robert's children were all bred of incest and had no actual entitlement to the Iron Throne, he recognized his right to be king, but despite his ambitions, Stannis did not appear (or externally appear) megalomaniacal. He admits to Davos Seaworth that although he did not ask to king, by every rightful law he is and had to accept his duty whether he liked it or not. Stannis, while fundamentally viewed as a good, or at the very least, decent man could easily be swayed due to his religious faith and obsession with fulfilling the prophecy of Azor Ahai which could turn him toward ruthless, regrettable actions, such as burning his daughter alive.\n\nStannis is also not as popular with the smallfolk as his two brothers are. Robert, although a poor ruler was at least respected as a warrior and Renly was the most well-liked of the Baratheons. Stannis, meanwhile, is lacking both the charisma and handsomeness that is found within his family. Due to his cold and blunt nature, he inspires little loyalty or love from his peers and he does not seem to care about his unpopularity nor does he seek the respect or admiration of the people but has faith that his men will follow him and die for him anyway because of his birthright. Stannis is also reliant on fear to keep his men in check and considers public displays of kindness a weakness leaders should not possess. On the other hand, Stannis's advisor, Davos Seaworth has complete loyalty, admiration and respect for Stannis and encourages his claim completely despite being drastically punished by him in the past, implying some degree of bravado on his part.\n\nEver since encountering Lady Melisandre and welcoming her into his inner council, he has accepted her religion in The Lord of Light completely and also her beliefs that he is The Prince That Was Promised, a messiah figure within the faith of R'hllor. Stannis, after converting to The Lord of Light has employed the use of blood magic to secure his claim to the throne such as human sacrifices and burning leeches. Stannis is also quite proud of his faith as he uses the symbol of R'hllor, a burning heart as the banner for his house, modified with the stag head of House Baratheon in the middle.\n\nStannis has a good side. If he is impressed with someone, and he is not above making personal friends. He did love his daughter, Shireen, defending her from his wife, Selyse who hated her since birth on account of her gender and refusing to kill her because of her Greyscale. He also made a friend of Davos Seaworth, one of his most trusted advisors and this was reciprocated fully with Davos pledging his loyalty and life to Stannis. He even planned to name him Hand of the King after he took the Iron Throne and comforted him over his sons death despite imprisoning him as a traitor at the time. He was obviously impressed with Jon Snow and, unlike many people in the Night's Watch, treated the bastard seriously presumably out of respect for his father, Eddard Stark who made him aware of Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella's parentage and was prepared to legitimise him as Jon Stark, making him the official Lord of Winterfell if he agreed to help his cause. Robert and Stannis were in a loveless brotherhood, which they admit to each other. This was also the same with Renly, however they appear on slightly better terms than with Robert. During negotiations he welcomed Renly to a place in his small council and (until he fathered a male heir) was prepared to allow him be heir to his throne if he lay down his forces. He also showed remorse over indirectly killing his little brother and he doesn't attempt to lie to Brienne of Tarth, Renly's Kingsguard, over his involvement. In the end Stannis doesn't begrudge Brienne's intentions and simply tells her to do her duty, which was to execute him.\n\nDespite his accomplishments and supreme tactics, Stannis was extremely stubborn. He refused to ask Robb Stark or his brother to his assist his army, ignoring that Robb and his goals could help each other, claiming he stole The North from his kingdom. Stannis equates this with everything, viewing everyone who does not support his claim as foes and lords of different parts of the Seven Kingdoms without his say-so as usurpers. The prime example of Stannis's rigidity is what caused his demise. Ignoring the loss of half his forces and Melisandre abandoning him, he continues his siege on Winterfell anyway and is quickly destroyed by Ramsay Bolton's forces. With his faith broken, his ambition quashed and his family destroyed, Stannis does not attempt to avoid his fate and calmly accepts his execution.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stannis_Baratheon"}}

She was also the half-sister of Rhaenyra Targaryen from her father's first marriage to Aemma Arryn. At some point, she became the wife of her eldest brother (which was common for the Targaryens in order to keep bloodlines \"pure\"). When her father was on his deathbed, he announced that his eldest child Rhaenyra would be Queen. However, Alicent firmly disagreed and proclaimed Aegon as King. This therefore lead to Helaena becoming Queen Consort of the Seven Kingdoms. This later lead to a rebellion between her half-sister and her eldest brother\/husband that would be known as the Dance of the Dragons, in which Aegon would set up loyalists to the crown known as the Greens, whilst Rhaenyra set up a rebellious faction known as the Blacks. She gave birth to three of Aegon's children Jaehaerys, Jaehaera and Maelor. During the rebellion, Daemon Targaryen hired two murderers, known as Blood and Cheese, to avenge the death of Rhaenyra's son, Lucerys Velaryon. One was a former Gold Cloak and the other was a rat catcher from Flea Bottom who knew every part of Maegor's holdfast. After breaking into the Red Keep, they demanded that Helaena choose which of her sons she would rather have dead, at the very minute she was putting her sons and daughter to bed. Whilst her sons were at knife-point, Helaena begged that they kill her instead, but Blood and Cheese refused. Faced with this ultimatum, Helaena named her youngest son Maelor as the victim of the assassins. Some believed that this was because he was too young to understand, but others believed that is was due to Jaehaerys being the heir to Aegon's throne. Cheese then told Maelor that he was unwanted by his mother. However, Blood then struck off the head of Jaehaerys with a single blow. By the time that the guards came to the bedroom, they found Helaena screaming, driven mad by grief, still clasping her child's corpse. This therefore made the war take a drastic turn, making it become an annihilation of bloodshed on Aegon's part. When Rhaenyra came to King's Landing on the back of her dragon, the Small Council surrendered Alicent and Helaena. After Rhaenyra finally took the throne from Aegon, resulting in his disappearance of him, Helaena flung her from the Red Keep, and was impaled on iron spikes that lined the moat.

He is not seen in the first season but has been guarding Drogo's wife Daenerys Targaryen since their marriage. Drogo is wounded and later dies leading to the separation of his khalasar. Following Drogo's death, Daenerys hatches three dragon eggs in his funeral pyre and Kovarro swears his loyalty to her. She names him as one of her bloodriders alongside Rakharo and Aggo.\n\nDaenerys leads what remains of her khalasar deep into the Red Waste. Facing starvation she sends Rakharo, Aggo and Kovarro to scout in three different directions, using the last remaining horses. Kovarro is sent east. He finds the city of Qarth and is met by the ruling council called the Thirteen. Hearing of the dragons they invite Daenerys to the city. They give Kovarro a replacement horse for his ride back into the Red Waste. He returns to the khalasar and reports his discovery that Qarth is three days to the east, on the sea. When Daenerys asks Ser Jorah Mormont what he knows of Qarth he tells her that the desert around it is known as the Garden of Bones because it is littered with the remains of travellers who have been refused entry to the city. Kovarro leads the khalasar to Qarth, but the Thirteen refuse to admit them without seeing the dragons. Daenerys threatens them and they are admitted under the protection of Xaro Xhoan Daxos.Xaro welcomes Daenerys into his home, giving her people accommodation and buying her gifts. He throws a reception for her in his gardens. Several of her khalasar are also present. Daenerys is distracted by Jorah Mormont, Kovarro and Malakho gathering around a bejewelled golden peacock statue. She asks Ser Jorah what they are doing and he reports that they are discussing stealing the statue. Malakho thinks that it is too heavy but Kovarro believes that they can parcel out the weight by prying out the jewels and chopping up the soft gold. Daenerys admonishes her bloodrider to show more respect for their host. He says that he will wait until they leave and she cautions him not to steal from the man who saved them from the Red Waste. Kovarro and Malakho walk off. Kovarro takes a goblet from a passing servant, emptying the liquid from it.\n\nKovarro accompanies Daenerys to a meeting with the Spice King who refuses to invest in her return to Westeros. When they return to Xaro's home, they find that it has been attacked. Irri and several Dothraki warriors have been killed along with some of Xaro's guards and the dragons have been stolen.\n\nKovarro stands guard for Daenerys when she appears before the Thirteen to appeal for their help. They are stunned when Pyat Pree admits to the theft and proclaims Xaro the king of Qarth. Pyat uses his magic to murder the rest of the Thirteen. Kovarro ushers Daenerys out of the meeting room. Pree's doubles follow them and invites Daenerys to reclaim her children at the House of the Undying. They take refuge in a disused courtyard and Daenerys convinces Jorah to accompany her to reclaim her dragons despite their certainty that it is a trap.\n\nKovarro aids Ser Jorah and Daenerys to the House of the Undying.

He ascended the social ladder until he entered the King's small council as the Master of Whisperers. Using his spy network and influence, Varys had his agents locate the sorcerer, who had him gagged and shipped to Varys in a crate.\n\nWhen Tyrion Lannister visits Varys to discover who ordered Ser Mandon Moore to try and kill him during the Battle of the Blackwater, he finds the Eunuch prying a crate open.

With these words, Varys closed the lid of the box again, with the sorcerer still inside.\n\nKinvara later tells Varys that the man who castrated him was little more than a \"second-rate sorcerer\", an amateur dabbling in the dark arts.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sorcerer"}}

Roslin will join him soon after she gives birth to their child."," "],"name":"Edmure Tully","description":"Ser Edmure is the son and heir of Lord Hoster Tully. Edmure is the new head of House Tully and thus has recently become the Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. The Riverlands are one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Tully is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Riverrun is the ancestral seat of House Tully.\n\nEdmure's mother Minisa Tully died in childbirth during his early childhood. He has two elder sisters Catelyn and Lysa. He was also raised with his father's ward, Petyr Baelish. It was Edmure who first nicknamed him \"Littlefinger.\"\n\nCatelyn is the widow of the late Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Lord Paramount of the North, and Lysa is the widow of Jon Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Lord Paramount of the Vale.\n\nTyrion is accused of the attempted murder of Bran Stark and taken prisoner by Catelyn Stark. Tywin Lannister launches an invasion on the Riverlands as a response. Jaime smashes the river lords at the battle of the Golden Tooth and lays siege to Riverrun. Edmure is not specifically mentioned, but he presumably takes part in the defense of his region.\n\nEdmure is first mentioned in a conversation between Robb Stark and Rickard Karstark. Rickard states that the march to Hoster's funeral is a distraction, but Robb tells him that Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. Rickard remains unconvinced and doesn't think he has enough men to make a difference in the war effort.\n\nEdmure presides over the funeral of his father, per the custom of House Tully, in which the departed is placed on a funeral boat and set on flames with a flaming arrow. Edmure fails at hitting the boat three times in a row, causing his annoyed uncle to push him away and complete the deed himself. After the funeral, Ser Brynden chides his nephew for attacking Stone Mill. Edmure proudly asserts that his \"blunder\" sent Gregor Clegane scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. He says that they will not win this war if Robb is the only one winning any battles, and that there is enough glory to go around. Robb responds angrily and tells him it is not about glory, before reminding him that his instructions were to wait for the Mountain to come to him. Robb informs him of his plan; he wanted to draw the Mountain to the west, into their country, where he could surround and kill him. Edmure tells Robb they took hostages, including Martyn and Willem Lannister. More than two hundred men were lost in the battle, less than what the Lannisters lost, but Robb furiously tells him that they need their men more than Tywin needs his. Edmure apologizes for his mistakes, but subtly tells Robb that it would not have happened had he known of his plan from the beginning.\n\nAfter Lord Rickard murders Willem and Martyn Lannister, Edmure insists that if word of this leaves Riverrun, Tywin Lannister will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews. Therefore, he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys, and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over. Robb, however, refuses to be a liar: he says he cannot fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks. Catelyn says they should keep Lord Rickard hostage, and Edmure agrees, adding that Robb should tell the other Karstarks that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal. Robb ignores their pleas, and he has Lord Karstark brought out to the courtyard of Riverrun to be executed during a driving rainstorm. Edmure then witnesses the execution.\n\nWhen emissaries from House Frey arrive at Riverrun to negotiate Walder Frey's terms of reconciliation with Robb Stark, Edmure is pressured by Robb, Brynden and Catelyn to take Robb's place in his previously arranged marriage to Roslin Frey. Edmure initially refuses, stating that the laws of gods and men are very clear; no man can compel another man to marry. His uncle Brynden threatens him and tells him that the laws of his fists are about to compel his teeth. Robb tells him that if he refuses, his alliance with the Freys is dead. Edmure wants to pick one of his daughters for himself, the same courtesy that was given to Robb. He thinks that if he refuses, Walder will come back and offer him a daughter of his own choosing. Catelyn scolds him, angrily asking him if he is willing to risk their freedom and lives for a chance at a prettier wife. Robb reminds him that he wanted to make amends for his military blunder at the Stone Mill, but Edmure had something less permanent in mind. Robb eventually manages to convince him and Edmure reluctantly agrees.\n\nIn the Riverlands, en route to The Twins, Robb's army is forced to make camp, their progress delayed by heavy rain. Catelyn warns them that the prickly Lord Frey will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him, but Edmure points out that Frey is getting the wedding he wanted; his sister counters that he is getting a wedding, but not the one he wanted, glaring at her son and his wife as she says so, pointing out that Frey wanted one of his daughters wed to a king. Robb retorts that Edmure is the best match House Frey has been offered in its history.\n\nUpon finally arriving at the Twins, Edmure nervously eyes Walder Frey's brood, trying to figure out which of the unattractive bunch is to be his wife. At the ceremony, Walder lifts Roslin's veil, revealing her to be a beauty, much to Edmure's relief, Robb's shock, and Catelyn's, the Blackfish's, and Walder's amusement. At the wedding feast, Edmure enjoys himself immensely and, when Walder and Robb call for the bedding ceremony, eagerly allows himself to be led away by the other Frey girls. It is only after his departure that the Red Wedding begins.\n\nEdmure is taken prisoner and remains a hostage of Lord Frey, who remarks to Lord Roose Bolton that Edmure spent his wedding night in a dungeon.\n\nEdmure is still a captive at the Twins when Ser Brynden raises what remains of the Tully army and retakes Riverrun. When Walder learns of this, he summons Edmure into the main hall. The disheveled Edmure is brought up from the dungeons in chains, and Lord Walder orders Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers to use him in taking back Riverrun.\n\nWhile the Freys are besieging Riverrun, outside the castle, Edmure stands beside Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers with a noose around his neck. They threaten to hang him if the Blackfish doesn't surrender Riverrun, but the Blackfish says nothing. When they hold a knife to Edmure's throat and threaten to cut his throat, the Blackfish calls their bluff and dares them to, knowing that if Edmure dies, the only chance the Freys have of taking the castle is by attacking it. Shortly thereafter, Ser Jaime Lannister arrives with a Lannister host to take command of the siege from the Freys. He chastises the Freys for making threats they are not prepared to carry out and orders Black Walder to bathe and feed Edmure.\n\nLater, Jaime meets Edmure in the tent where he is being imprisoned and implores him to appeal to his uncle to surrender Riverrun. The Blackfish is an old man and is willing to die for honor's sake, Jaime reasons, but Edmure has much of his life still ahead of him and would rather live by surrendering. Jaime mentions that despite Edmure only spending his wedding night with his new wife Roslin Frey (in the hours before the massacre at the Twins begin), this was enough to impregnate her, and she has given birth to Edmure's infant son. Edmure points out that he has never seen his son, nor has he seen Roslin since the Red Wedding, and he has been in a cell in the Freys' dungeon for years since the massacre.\n\nJaime offers to reunite him with his wife and son and have him live out his days in gentle imprisonment as a hostage at Casterly Rock. His son will be tutored, trained in combat, and given his own keep when he comes of age. Edmure refuses, and incredulously asks Jaime if he actually thinks himself to be a decent person. Edmure then seriously asks how Jaime can possibly stand to live with himself, day after day, after all of the crimes committed by him and his faction in this war, specifically massacring his family. Though Jaime briefly appears shaken by the truth of his captive's words, he threatens that if Edmure declines his offer, he will bring his infant son to the siege and hurl him at the castle walls with a catapult. Edmure does not realize that Jaime is bluffing, and reluctantly agrees to his terms.\n\nEdmure approaches Riverrun's gates and requests entry as the Lord of Riverrun and head of House Tully. The Blackfish orders his men not to let him in, as he knows that Edmure is coming to demand the surrender of the Tully garrison. Sworn to the head of House Tully and not the Blackfish, the Blackfish's men see no option but to comply with their lord's demand, and allow Edmure entry. Upon entering, Edmure commands that his men surrender, that the gates be lowered to allow in the combined Lannister and Frey force retaking the castle, and that his uncle be captured. The Lannister-Frey army enters Riverrun, but as Jaime had hoped, it is a peaceful surrender and no lives are lost. A Lannister guard later reports to Jaime, however, that the Blackfish died fighting when the guards came to restrain him.\n\nWalder Frey later mentions that Edmure is back in a cell, although he has no plans to kill him as \"killing [his] son by law would not be right.\" After the celebration, however, Walder is murdered by Edmure's niece Arya Stark.\n\nAfter killing Lord Walder, Arya uses his face to impersonate him and kill all his sons with poison before riding south. Edmure is presumably still being held captive by the Lannisters.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Edmure_Tully"}}

However, she later unites the newly crowned King in the North with Daenerys Targaryen, believing they both have an important part to play in the Great War.","Originally born a slave in Essos centuries ago, Melisandre is a Red Priestess of the Lord of Light, a deity that is not widely worshiped in Westeros. Hailing from Asshai, a country located in the far east of the continent of Essos, she claims to wield powerful magical abilities, particularly the power of prophecy. Melisandre wears a large ruby necklace that seems to glow whenever she performs her magic. Some years ago she crossed the Narrow Sea and came to the court of Lord Stannis Baratheon on the island stronghold of Dragonstone, to preach her faith.

Later, she oversees the burning of Mance Rayder, personally lighting the pyre and denouncing him as a King of Lies, while proclaiming Stannis the only true king.","Melisandre is present at a war council meeting while Sansa Stark, Jon Snow and Davos discuss which of the Northern houses they can ask for support. Melisandre later rides with Jon and Sansa when they depart from Castle Black.","When Jon Snow finally arrives at Dragonstone, Melisandre stays back, observing from the cliffs.

Melisandre says that she will stay away from both Jon and Daenerys as her days of \"whispering in the ears of kings\" are over. Melisandre declares that she has \"brought ice and fire together\" and that her work is done. Varys is delighted to hear that she will depart for Volantis soon, and advises her not to return to Westeros. Melisandre states that she cannot follow that advice, as she must return to Westeros once more to face her end: like Varys, it is her fate to die in Westeros.","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Melisandre is a priestess of the red god, R'hllor, the Lord of Light, whose worship involves the idolization of fire and light. R'hllor is a popular deity in several of the Free Cities (particularly Lys, Myr, and Volantis) but is almost unheard of in Westeros. Although the series has altered some of Melisandre's actions, van Houten's portrayal is overall consistent with Melisandre as described in the books."],"name":"Melisandre","description":"Melisandre is best defined by her seemingly unwavering faith in the Lord of Light, which seems to dominate every move she makes. A religious fanatic, she attributes many, if not any, great thing to be done in the world as an act carried out by the Lord; however, funnily enough, she doesn't credit herself with anything she does in the fire god's service, describing herself as simply a vessel for his will. She is extremely intelligent in her own way and appears to have an uncanny understanding of other people, which enables her to either gain their trust or to subdue them in a confrontation without it coming to blows between them, which sets her apart from women like Cersei Lannister (who subdues them by threatening them with her own family's power) and Margaery Tyrell (who actually gets people to trust her and feel comfortable around her). The latter is a person whom Melisandre especially contrasts with in this regard, because almost everyone feels uneasy around her, in spite of her calm and serene behaviour.\n\nMelisandre has a habit of being exceptionally changeable in spite of her absolute faith in R'hllor, which is demonstrated several times. When she meets Stannis Baratheon, she convinces him that he will win the war with great ease on the basis that he is the one true king, and goes to extremely great lengths to ensure that this victory is carried out (to the point of using blood magic to murder Renly Baratheon, which proves to be a wasteful move since Stannis ended up losing the Battle of Blackwater Bay anyway). When Stannis broods over losing at Blackwater Bay, he actually threatens her and she remains faithful to R'hllor, although she doesn't willingly admit that her god wronged both her and Stannis by causing the loss at Blackwater Bay - a suggestion which Melisandre ought to believe because she is convinced that the Lord of Light controls everything, and seems to have protected the usurping lords who stand against Stannis. She defends herself by assuring Stannis that the war between Stannis and his enemies will be long and costly, but eventually he will succeed.\n\nMelisandre is a woman who is completely aware of her own enigma - in fact, her enigma is something that she relishes in. Very little is truly known about her past other than generalisations that she gives other people; she claims that she has been fighting for far longer than Stannis ever has (something which is strongly supported by how old she is revealed to be), and is revealed to actually be a ferocious opponent in her own right, as she subdues Stannis when he attacks her by reminding him of how he needs her alongside him. She also frightens Davos Seaworth with her own powers, especially by alluring him in anticipation for what he is about to see. One prime example is when Davos returns to Dragonstone and Melisandre maintains control over Stannis by provoking Davos into attacking her, which leads to him being arrested. In spite of her animosity, Melisandre wasn't above realising that Davos was still of use to Stannis and that he would be needed in the coming war. Melisandre is also completely able, and adept, at using her own sex to her advantage, seducing Gendry into being a part of her ritual for Stannis - however, when Robb Stark is killed as a result of this ritual, Melisandre scorns Davos for wanting to see the Lord's power, since the ritual still hasn't brought Stannis closer to the Iron Throne, even though Melisandre performed the ritual herself.\n\nMelisandre, although apparently representing a god who is good and true, can deliberately be incredibly ruthless and cruel. She is completely willing to erase hundreds of lives in representation of her faith in the Lord of Light, to the point of outright murdering good men and allies under the assumption that it will win Stannis favor with her god. She saw nothing wrong with burning people publicly, and behaved as if they had been freed from their sinful bodies and become assets to the Lord of Light, comparing it to how a woman screams before she gives birth and is immeasurably happy afterwards - Shireen Baratheon is quick to point out the drastic difference being that women giving birth aren't ash and bone afterwards. Melisandre speaks of the sinfulness and cruelty of her enemies, even though she herself can be cruel and even arrogantly, unapologetically sadistic, shown prominently when she taunts Davos with the concept that the mass-casualties at Blackwater Bay were his fault because Melisandre wasn't there, and how she uses Mathos's own death (which happened right in front of Davos) as an example to this. The worst example of her cruelty by far is when she convinces Stannis to burn his own daughter alive in public, ignorant to the screams of both Shireen and her mother, and the brutal despair that Stannis experiences.\n\nAs the War of the Five Kings climaxes and devolves into disaster, Melisandre's faith begins to crack. She begins to lose faith in Stannis as the Battle of Winterfell comes closer at hand, but remains at his side for the most part; however, after the deaths of Shireen and Selyse (the latter of which Melisandre is partly responsible for), Melisandre flees the battle, perhaps in fear of Stannis's rage, and is unable to do anything to help Stannis crush the Boltons in battle, even though she claimed to Davos that she would have eased Stannis's victory at Blackwater. Melisandre's faith is crushed at the news of Stannis's defeat and the concept that she was wrong, and she becomes more withdrawn than before. She seems to transfer her faith to Jon Snow, who actually proves to be the man who would win a great battle in the North, and supports him after she resurrects him. This is a surprising turn for Melisandre because she supported Stannis so strongly under the impression that he was the one true king that would defeat the great evil to come, only to transfer her faith to somebody else. On the other hand, this is an understandable move by Melisandre because she tries to maintain her faith in the Lord of Light, in spite of the misfires and obstacles that come her way. It should be noted that during her service to Jon, Melisandre stops proselytizing her faith and only uses her magic when he commands it, adopting a more subdued approach to her religion and future events and ultimately behaving a bit more like Thoros.\n\nMelisandre's inadvertent cruelty and ruthlessness, as well as her extremely costly faith in the Lord of Light, finally explodes in her face when Davos finally confronts her over the death of Princess Shireen. Having quarrelled with Davos over the true greatness of the Lord of Light from the beginning, Melisandre is defenseless when Davos berates her over the wastefulness of her sacrifices and the fact that, in spite of her claims to represent a great god, she purposefully burned a child at the stake on the basis that she had king's blood in her veins. Melisandre is unable to speak when Davos condemns the Lord of Light as evil because of what he 'made' Melisandre do, and has the gall to shame Stannis and Selyse as equivalently responsible for Shireen's death, even though, out of the three of them, Melisandre was the only one who didn't show restraint in the act. She is unapologetic about her own blind faith, and maintains her philosophy that the Lord of Light is influential in the battle between good and evil, and the fact that she committed unforgivably evil acts in representation of good.\n\nEven though Melisandre stakes a claim of superior knowledge about the Lord of Light, she faces several incidents and outcomes which she proves unable to predict or even understand. She is speechless at the revelation that Beric Dondarrion had been brought back six times by the Lord of Light, which she deemed impossible. She is also disappointed at the concept that there is nothing after death, even though she convinced herself and tried to convince many others that death would be a release into someplace much greater than the hell that everyone lives in.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Melisandre"}}

Syrio tells her that she is more vulnerable when she is \"with her trouble\" rather than concentrating on the here and now. He teaches her how to forget her troubles so she can concentrate on fighting.","Arya believes Syrio to be dead, and tells the Hound that he was killed by Ser Meryn Trant. Sandor proceeds to mock Syrio, claiming that Trant is a poor fighter, and that \"Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants\".","Arya finally exacts vengeance for Syrio when she kills Meryn Trant at a brothel in Braavos.","Braavos and the Free Cities are loosely similar to the medieval Italian city-states, vaguely \"Mediterranean\", so actor Miltos Yerolemou, a Greek Cypriot based in London, portrayed Syrio with an accent \"a little Greek, a little Italian and a little Spanish, and then pushed it East into Persia\". Given the diverse polyglot nature of Braavos, there is no way of taking Syrio's on-screen accent as \"typical\" of all Braavosi (the way that Cersei could recognize Shae's Lorath accent). The Spanish dub of the TV series produced in Spain renders Syrio's speech as an Arabic accent, to try to maintain the impression that he is a foreigner to Westeros.","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Syrio Forel was once the First Sword of Braavos, the most skilled bravo or sword-fighter of the city, in the service of the Sealord himself. He specialized in a style of combat known as 'water dancing', favoring a light sword and expert balance over the Westerosi style of hacking at one another with massive swords in heavy armor. It is unclear why he departed Braavos to relocate to King's Landing."],"name":"Syrio Forel","description":"Mastering the technique of the Braavosi Water Dance, Syrio Forel was eccentric and confident in his movements and words, showing himself fearless and flamboyant. Arya Stark states that he was one of the greatest swordsmen that ever lived; this is proven true as he single-handedly defeated five armored Kingsguard with a wooden training sword. Syrio never wore armor in combat and preferred light weaponry, as the Water Dance strongly relies on agility and being light on one's feet. He often used his enemies use of armor to his advantage in a fight, wearing them down and outmaneuvering them with his speed before finishing them off. Syrio's lack of armor and strong weapons, however, might have resulted in his downfall against Meryn Trant. Sandor Clegane jests that even through Syrio might have been \"the greatest swordsman who ever lived\", he lost to the cowardly and weak Trant solely because the knight had a big sword and armor. Syrio's teaching style could be considered unusual but effective. During lessons with Arya, he taught her that in combat the sword and the one holding it should be one, and to teach her mobility and dexterity, had her chase cats around the Red Keep.\n\nSyrio seemed to lack faith in the Old Gods and the New, claiming the only true God is Death, as everyone succumbs to Him eventually. He possesses a warrior's belief in this, however, claiming that the only thing one says to Death is \"not today\". Courageous, implacable and fearsome, Syrio showed no visible fear even when faced with Meryn Trant and deprived of his only weapon's effectiveness. Syrio had a very observant view on Westerosi combat, considering it to be little more than hacking and hammering, in that it lacked elegance or precision (An opinion only acceptable from a master swordsman, naturally), and he had a sense of honour as evidenced by his disgust that Meryn Trant's men would have the gall to threaten a little girl. Syrio Forel was obviously quite charismatic, as he inspired Arya's behaviour after his death: She was motivated to kill Meryn Trant for killing Syrio, and continued to utilise his lessons after he allowed her to escape from Cersei Lannister's men.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Syrio_Forel"}}

The Royal Fleet is anchored at Dragonstone, positioned to defend King's Landing and Blackwater Bay . The large fleet of House Redwyne is used primarily to defend their home ports on the Arbor, a large island off the southwest coast of the Reach. The Iron Fleet, composing the navy of the Iron Islands, isn't usually thought of as at the authority of the Iron Throne. If anything, the royal fleets are often used to keep the Iron Fleet in check when ironborn captains ignore the ban on commerce raiding that the Targaryen kings imposed when they took power. House Lannister also commanded a large fleet anchored at Lannisport, but it was destroyed in the Greyjoy Rebellion. The Lannisters subsequently rebuilt their local fleet, though it is kept on a purely defensive posture around Lannisport during the War of the Five Kings, due to the nearby threat of the ironborn.\n\nOne of Stannis's few advantages at the opening of the War of the Five Kings is that while he - initially - has the smallest land army out of all factions in the war, as the former Master of Ships, a disproportionately large fraction of the Royal Fleet sides with him. George R.R. Martin confirmed in the Blu-ray commentary for \"Blackwater\" that while it is not outright stated in dialogue in the TV series, Stannis's position as Master of Ships during his brother Robert's reign is why he has the allegiance of most of the Royal Fleet.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Master_of_Ships"}}

Beric honors their agreement, and Sandor is released.","At a meeting of the Small Council, Varys informs the other members that The Hound has been seen in the Riverlands. Cersei calls Sandor a coward and a traitor. After learning of the incident at the tavern, Tywin raises the bounty on Clegane to one hundred Silver Stags.","He tracks down three of the perpetrators and brutally kills two of them, decapitating one of them, then buries his axe into the second outlaw, then slits another outlaw's throat and finally swinging his axe into the last outlaw's crotch. He demands Lem's whereabouts, but the man refuses to answer, prompting Sandor to finish him. Sandor ultimately finds Lem and his two cronies, about to be hanged by Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr. Sandor demands the privilege of murdering them himself, but relents and settles by hanging Lem and one crony personally, and taking Lem's boots for himself. Later, while eating with the Brotherhood, Beric reminisces on his previous fight with Sandor and convinces him to join their cause, as they are heading North to counter the coming White Walkers.","Sandor travels with Jon to the parley in King's Landing, marking his first return to the city since he abandoned it during the Battle of the Blackwater. He reunites with Brienne, and recalls how she nearly killed him. Brienne informs him of Arya's safety, and how she can defend herself. Sandor appears pleased.","Sandor Clegane shares many traits with his brother, such as his large build, immense strength and toughness, though not to the same extent as Gregor, especially after the latter has been revived by Qyburn. Sandor has shown to be capable of lifting a man clean off the ground by his neck with no visible strain or forward momentum from the weight. After being wounded and slightly crippled from his fight with Brienne, Sandor still possessed strength enough to carry a massive log by himself, whereas the other logs needed four people to carry them. Sandor is a skilled swordsman but favors heavy strikes and brute force, like his brother he utilizes his sword in a one-handed style. Sandor is atleast compentently skilled in using a warhammer and daggers, as demonstrated in his battles with the wights.","Spoken by Sandor","Sandor's fate is similarly ambiguous in the novels: Arya simply leaves him to die, but has never been confirmed that he actually died. In A Feast for Crows, during their search for Sansa and Arya, Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne visit a monastery at the Quiet Isle, where they spot a limping hooded man fitting Sandor's general description works as a gravedigger; Sandor's horse, Stranger, is also there. The Elder Brother tells Brienne that the Hound is dead and that he buried him himself, covered him with stones, and set his helm atop the cairn to mark his final resting place. The Elder Brother tells further: \"I came upon him by the Trident, drawn by his cries of pain. He begged me for the gift of mercy, but I am sworn not to kill again. Instead, I bathed his fevered brow with river water, and gave him wine to drink and a poultice for his wound, but my efforts were too little and too late. The Hound died there, in my arms.\""],"name":"Sandor Clegane","description":"The Hound is seen as a violent, aggressive and brutal man, with a fatalistic view of the world. He is a formidable warrior and he doesn't hide his love of killing people, believing all men love it, and he generally hates soldiers who try to convince themselves otherwise. However, he also displays small hints at being a reasonably affectionate and compassionate man underneath, particularly in response to Joffrey's treatment of Sansa. This is largely a result of his disgust at the brutality of his older brother Gregor: the respect and knighthood given to Gregor for his extreme brutality left Sandor thoroughly disillusioned that honorable men succeed in the real world the way they do in romantic songs. His growing disgust at Joffrey's sadism and concern for both of the Stark girls, however, show that he is not yet so cynical that there are no moral boundaries he wouldn't cross.\n\nThere were a few times when Clegane showed visible signs of hating Joffrey, such as when he orders Sansa Stark to be stripped and beaten by Ser Meryn Trant. The Hound was the first to offer Sansa a cloak to cover herself after Tyrion ordered the spectacle to stop. His affection for Sansa is also demonstrated at the Battle of Blackwater when he offers to take her back to Winterfell, which she declines. He also seems intent on lecturing her about killers such as Joffrey, Tywin, and even her brother Robb Stark, trying bluntly to inform her about how brutal the world really is. This was not the only time he showed something that bordered on compassion: he was brave enough, during the Hand's Tourney, to stop Gregor Clegane (A man he hates beyond any calculation) from needlessly butchering Loras Tyrell.\n\nDespite having initially a captor-prisoner relationship. Sandor becomes protective and even trusting of Arya. During their journey to the Eyrie, Sandor slowly opens up to Arya, and tells her how his own brother burned half of his face. He tells her that the worst part wasn't the actual pain, but the betrayal that his own brother did it, and that his own father covered it up by telling everyone that Sandor was burned by some bedding that caught fire. He points out that while Arya thinks she's alone because most of her family is dead or missing, he is even more alone, because at least while Arya's parents were alive they cared about her, unlike his own family. When the pair meet Brienne of Tarth he immediately becomes aggressive and protective of Arya even saying that he is the one who watches over her, implying a significant bond has grown between them, this is reflected later on when Arya tells the Waif that she had taken him off of her list.\n\nAfter his near-death experience, Sandor becomes more reflective of his actions and many of Septon Ray's teachings resonate with him, helping him to develop an aversion to unnecessary violence and a desire to live in a peaceful, contributory manner. This is also partly due to Ray's own dark past when he committed heinous crimes at the wishes of others, similar to Sandor during his service with the Lannisters. However, he is still fully willing to fight when the need arises, disagreeing with Ray's notion of not taking up arms if left with no other choice. This is further proven after Ray's murder, where Sandor sought to avenge his slain friend immediately until he reunites with Thoros and Beric. Though he resents Beric and Thoros for their previous encounter, his desire to protect the innocent compels him to join the Brotherhood and to help Jon Snow fight against the coming army of the dead.\n\nDespite having mellowed out somewhat during his stay with Ray and the villagers, Sandor has since reverted to his more cynical and acidic self, swearing and openingly insulting his allies in the brotherhood. However, Sandor still retains his guilt and capacity for remorse as upon coming across a farmhouse he recognized, he instantly became reluctant to enter it. Later, he is discovered by Thoros of Myr burying the dead out of guilt for his part in their fate and laments that they deserved better.\n\nSandor, despite being proud of being tough and \"hard to kill\" as he once told Ray, held no shame in being defeated by Brienne of Tarth, openingly telling Ray when he asked who took him down, that it was by a woman. Upon meeting Brienne again on his way to the Dragon Pit, they exchanged words civily, both of them explaining that they were just trying to protect Arya.\n\nWhile Sandor hates his brother to the point of desiring to kill him, when confronting Gregor as the Dragon Pit, he showed a moment of emotion when asking Gregor what was done to him before quickly dismissing it and reminding his brother who was going to end him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sandor_Clegane"}}

He was the great-uncle of Daenerys Targaryen, and unknown to him, was the great-great uncle of Jon Snow. Aemon's origins have long been forgotten by most, as he remained dedicated to his vows as a Maester and a brother of the Night's Watch for many decades. ","For the TV series, Jaehaerys II has been removed, with Aerys II being the son of Aegon V, thus the televised Aemon more closely related to Daenerys and Viserys, being their great-uncle instead of their great-great uncle."],"name":"Aemon","description":"Aemon was born into the royal House Targaryen, the second son of King Maekar I and Queen Dyanna. Originally known as Prince Aemon Targaryen, he was not his father's eldest son, so he eventually joined the order of Maesters. Aemon gave up all rights to inheritance when he took his vows, which also included relinquishing his surname \"Targaryen\".\n\nAemon's older brother, Aerion, later died, however, and despite being a sworn maester there were those who felt that the crown should pass to him. Aemon refused the throne, however, and it passed to his younger brother, who became King Aegon V. Aemon then joined the Night's Watch to further remove himself from the political intrigues of the royal court and from those who wished to set him up as a rival against his brother.\n\nMany years later, Aegon V died in the Tragedy at Summerhall and the crown passed to his son, Aemon's nephew Aerys II, who later became known as \"The Mad King\". Aerys's growing insanity ultimately led to the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion, which saw House Targaryen deposed and practically exterminated. Upon hearing about the brutal deaths of his family in King's Landing during the rebellion, Aemon bore great sadness which never left him.\n\nAround one hundred years old, Aemon is thought to be one of the oldest living men in Westeros, though he has retained all of his wits and his mind is still very sharp. He has served as the maester at Castle Black for many decades.\n\nAemon has long since gone blind due to old age. It is not clear when he went blind (he was not born blind), though he has stated that he was already old and blind during Robert's Rebellion. As a man of learning, he laments not being able to read anymore, even though Castle Black ironically has an ancient and well-stocked library consisting of thousands of books. Because one of a maester's basic duties is to handle messages sent to and from a castle by messenger-ravens, Aemon has to rely on the assistance of others to physically read the letters for him.\n\nAfter Tyrion Lannister has arrived at Castle Black, Maester Aemon asks him to urge the Queen to send more men to the Night's Watch: there is a severe lack of men to defend the Wall. They discuss the coming winter, and Aemon assures Tyrion that the next winter will be long and terrible. Lord Commander Mormont is worried about rumors of White Walkers abroad north of the Wall. He sends Benjen Stark ranging to investigate.\n\nWhen Jon Snow and the other new recruits are done with their first training, Maester Aemon gives the new stewards their assignments. Jon is to become Jeor Mormont's steward, which is a great disappointment to Jon: he had hoped to become a ranger. Samwell Tarly is assigned as Aemon's steward, to help physically read letters delivered by messenger-ravens to the blind old man. Aemon chides Jon that he swore a vow to serve the Watch in any capacity, then departs. Sam then reminds Jon that being a steward for the Lord Commander might mean that Jon is being groomed for a high command position in the Watch. The bodies of two of the rangers who accompanied Benjen are found near the Godswood. The Lord Commander plans to have Aemon examine them, but they return as wights and have to be burned before he does so.\n\nWhen Jon hears about his \"father\" Eddard Stark's imprisonment, he is torn between his loyalty to the Night's Watch and his love for his family. Maester Aemon intercepts Jon as he is preparing to desert the Watch. Aemon says he is aware of Jon's struggle and reveals his Targaryen heritage to him, recounting the deaths of his nephew Aerys II, Aerys's son Rhaegar, and Rhaegar's two young children; neither Aemon nor Jon are aware that Rhaegar and his children were Jon's true father and half-siblings. He sat and waited on the Wall while he heard about his family being butchered during Robert's Rebellion and the few survivors fleeing into exile, and did nothing because having joined the Watch, his duty was with his brothers there and no longer with his House. Aemon explains that this was a difficult decision, yet he had to make it and that one must live with the consequences of one's choices for the rest of one's life. Maester Aemon remains at Castle Black during the Lord Commander's great ranging.\n\nMaester Aemon is still at Castle Black when Samwell Tarly returns with Gilly after escaping from Craster's Keep. Aemon at first advises Sam that he swore an oath when joining the Night's Watch, believing that Sam fathered Gilly's son.\n\nSamwell corrects him that he is not the father, but that the girl is one of Craster's daughter-wives, which engenders sympathy in Aemon. Because it is too dangerous beyond the Wall, Aemon relents and offers shelter to Gilly in Castle Black for the time being. Gilly thanks him and calls him \"my lord\", but Aemon insists that he gave up being a lord many years ago (when he joined the Order of Maesters and left House Targaryen). With the matter settled, Aemon commands Samwell to make sure all of the messenger-ravens are well-fed, and tells him to take a quill and parchment: he dictates to Samwell a request for help which will be sent to all the major lords throughout the Seven Kingdoms, imploring them for aid against the threat of the White Walkers.\n\nMaester Aemon is one of the five black brothers to \"judge\" Jon Snow for his actions during his time with the wildlings. Jon hides nothing of his actions, neither his murder of Qhorin or his affair with Ygritte.\n\nSer Alliser Thorne, the acting Commander of the Night's Watch, and the recently arrived Janos Slynt believe that Jon should be executed for his actions and for the breaking of his vows, but Aemon defends him, saying that Jon was merely following Qhorin's orders and that he isn't the first to have broken his vow of chastity. Ser Alliser points out that Jon has quite literally slept with the enemy. Jon counters with all the information that he had learned while among the wildlings, such as Mance Rayder's strategy of attacking the Wall from the North and the South, and demands that they either kill him or let him go. Aemon tells him that they have no intention of executing him and Jon leaves. Alliser reprimands Aemon for having overruled him but the maester answers that he knows when a man is lying and when he is telling the truth. When asked how he acquired such insight, Aemon wryly replies that he grew up in King's Landing.\n\nMaester Aemon is present when Olly brings news of the massacre that occurred in his village. Many black brothers present want to retaliate, but Aemon reminds everyone that there are just over 100 men at Castle Black (including himself). He insists that defending Castle Black is the priority and they cannot afford to lose a single man. Jon Snow reluctantly agrees, reminding everyone that he knows from his time infiltrating the wildlings that they are trying to lure as many men out of Castle Black as possible, to weaken it for the main assault from the north.\n\nOn the eve of Mance Rayder's assault on Castle Black, Maester Aemon confronts Sam in Castle Black's library. Aemon remarks on the ironies of old age: the library is well-stocked with thousands of books, but his blind eyes can no longer read them. They discuss some of the propaganda surrounding wildlings before discussing Sam's feelings for Gilly. Aemon shares with Sam the same warning he gave to Jon, that love is the death of duty. Aemon implies that he might have become King of the Andals and the First Men if he'd been willing to break his vows. He also mentions that as a royal prince, he was sought after by a great many women in his youth \u2013 but there was only one whose advances he accepted. Aemon reprimands Sam for not realizing his elders were young once too. Although Aemon says that his memories of that woman are in some ways more real to him than Sam is (given that he'll never really know what Sam looks like), he lets the subject drop and says that he and Sam should both focus on their duties.\n\nFollowing the arrival of Stannis Baratheon, Maester Aemon leads the eulogy for the black brothers that gave their lives defending Castle Black. When Jon Snow speaks to Tormund, the captive wildling curiously asks why he was given medical treatment. Jon tells Tormund that it is Aemon's duty as a maester to treat anyone who is wounded, friend or foe.\n\nMaester Aemon presides over the choosing of the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He allows people to speak for their candidates before the voting begins. When Sam asks to speak and is mocked by Janos Slynt, Sam reveals that he had found Janos hiding in a cellar during the Battle of Castle Black. As Sam continues to humiliate Lord Janos to the delight of many black brothers, Maester Aemon smiles at his steward's boldness. When all of the votes are counted, it is revealed that there is a tie between Jon Snow and Ser Alliser Thorne. Aemon is the last to vote and breaks the tie by voting for Jon.\n\nJon Snow notices Maester Aemon's absence at a meeting of the Night's Watch and questions Sam. According to Sam, Aemon does not feel well and apologizes for not being able to attend the meeting. Jon tells Sam to take good care of the old maester.\n\nSam reads him a letter from Slaver's Bay detailing the recent activities of Daenerys Targaryen, Aemon's great-niece. In spite of his dedication to his vows, Aemon muses with sadness at the injustice of Daenerys fighting her battles alone, with her last relation \"useless and dying\" thousands of miles away. Jon Snow then arrives, asking for Aemon's advice on a plan he's been devising. Jon asks how he's feeling, and Aemon sardonically points out he feels like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death at the Wall. Aemon bluntly tells him to \"kill the boy, and let the man be born\", that Snow must make the mature decisions that will save lives, rather than the immature decisions that will get people to like him.\n\nAemon's old age catches up to him and he takes to bed as he grows weaker, tended by Gilly and Sam. His mind starts to wander, and he imagines conversations with his late brother \"Egg\" before he passes away. Sam later gives a eulogy as Aemon's body is cremated on a funeral pyre.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Aemon"}}

When she was young she dreamed of being a regal Queen like Cersei Lannister, and that just like in the epic songs she would meet her knight in shining armor. She has inherited her mother's Tully coloring, like most of her siblings, and Lady Catelyn thinks Sansa will be even more beautiful than she was when she was younger. She is often seen in contrast with her sister, Arya Stark who has neither her looks nor her accomplishments in feminine activities and comportment.","Sansa is given praise by Septa Mordane after exceeding in her sewing abilities, in contrast to her sister Arya, who finds this tedious and difficult.","Stannis Baratheon sails his fleet into the bay outside King's Landing, triggering the Battle of the Blackwater. Sansa is summoned to the throne room to say goodbye to Joffrey. He forces her to kiss his new sword and she subtly undermines his bravado. She then takes refuge in Maegor's Holdfast with Shae; Cersei is hosting the women of the court there. She torments Sansa during the battle, mocking her faith, telling her that Ser Ilyn Payne is present to kill her if the walls are breached and drunkenly telling her to use her sexuality as a weapon. Cersei eventually storms out, believing the battle lost. Sansa attempts to keep the morale of the women up with prayers and singing. Shae tells Sansa to return to her chambers and bar her door to keep her safe should Stannis breach the keep. Sansa finds Sandor waiting for her inside. He tells her that he is going north and offers to take her with him. She is reluctant to leave the potential safety of being rescued by Stannis but he warns her that all men are killers. Stannis's force is ultimately defeated by a host of House Lannister and House Tyrell reinforcements led by Tywin Lannister.","While the daughter and sister of traitors, Sansa is a very valuable hostage. If Robb Stark dies, she becomes \"the key to the North\" as the Lady of Winterfell, greatly expanding the power of whichever great house she marries into. While she prays at the Red Keeps's godswood under guard, Margaery comes and talks to her, telling her that they should see Highgarden, the Tyrell home, together. Sansa replies that Cersei would never allow her to leave King's Landing. Margaery tells her that she could be wife to Margaery's brother Loras Tyrell, to which Sansa is overjoyed. They go to see Loras during his swordplay practice, during which she admires him. Loras and Sansa spend more time together in the following weeks, though Sansa is far more enthusiastic about their impending marriage than he is. Loras admits he's always wanted a big wedding with lots of guests, fancy food and a good tournament, though he only seems to remember that there will be a bride when Sansa gives him an expectant look. One subject where they do find common ground is their shared hatred of King's Landing, with Loras declaring the capital to be \"the most terrible place there is\".","Meanwhile, Joffrey amuses himself with a farcical \"reenactment\" of the War of the Five Kings, with each king being played by a dwarf. The dwarf playing Robb Stark wears a wolf's head that is eventually knocked off by the dwarf playing Joffrey. Sansa again looks on in grief. When Tyrion makes a veiled reference to his nephew's cowardice during the Battle of Blackwater, a furious Joffrey pours wine over his uncle's head and orders him to be his cupbearer to humiliate him further. Joffrey drops his goblet on purpose and then kicks it under the table when Tyrion tries to pick it up. Sansa, seemingly feeling pity for Tyrion, picks up the goblet and hands it to him. At Sansa's behest, she and Tyrion try to leave, but Joffrey calls them back and demands Tyrion bring him the cup again. Tyrion grudgingly obliges but unbeknownst to everyone, Olenna had slipped some poison into Joffrey's cup. Poison that was contained in a stone that Olenna pilfered from the necklace that Sansa was wearing. Later, as Joffrey lies dying from being poisoned, Dontos Hollard approaches Sansa and encourages her to leave in order to save her life, a suggestion Sansa takes to heart.","Sansa, still under the alias Alayne, attends a sword jousting session for Lord Robin at Runestone, along with Littlefinger and Yohn Royce, visibly unimpressed with Robin's sub-par skills at swordsmanship. Sansa notices that Littlefinger receives a raven message. Soon after, they leave Robin in the care of Lord Royce, for further training. On the carriage ride, Sansa questions Petyr as to why they are heading west when Lord Royce was told they would be traveling to the Fingers, unsure of his source of distrust. Petyr promises her that they are going somewhere far away, where Sansa will be safe from Queen Cersei.  On their journey, Sansa and Baelish stop for lunch at an inn, where she tries ale for the first time. Sansa can't see what all the fuss is about, although the entire episode is designed to catch Littlefinger off-guard so she can ask about the raven-message he received back at Runestone. Baelish doesn't answer the question beyond indicating that the old saying \"dark wings, dark words\" doesn't apply in this instance. Shortly thereafter, Brienne of Tarth appears unexpectedly and declares herself for Sansa. Baelish doubts that Sansa would want a sworn shield who let both of her previous masters die, even when Brienne reveals the true, somewhat unbelievable circumstances of Renly's death. Sansa seems inclined to agree with Littlefinger, pointing out that Brienne was present at Joffrey's wedding, to which the warrior replies that neither of them wanted to be there. Sansa rejects Brienne's offer of service and watches as she quickly defeats the guards and escapes.","With the Stark victory, the remaining Northern lords joined by the Vale Lords arrive at Winterfell to discuss the new situation in the North. Some, such as Lord Yohn Royce, object to the wildlings' presence, but Jon defends them as they had been invited. The lords of both the North and the Vale claim that they need to return to their homes before the winter hits, despite Jon's warnings that the true threat represented by the White Walkers is still coming down on them. At this point, Lyanna Mormont chastises the assembled Northmen for refusing to support Jon in his hour of need. Although she stands by her declaration to Stannis Baratheon that no one but a Stark will rule over the North, she discards Jon's bastard status, instead acknowledging him as having Ned Stark's blood in his veins. With that, she acclaims him as the King in the North, as his \"brother\" Robb had been before him. Lyanna's speech is followed by a similar declaration from both Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor, and Lord Glover of Deepwood Motte. The assembled Lords of the North and the Vale acclaim Jon Snow as the King in the North. Jon looks at Sansa, and she smiles back at him, but her smile fades when she glances at Littlefinger (the only other person not cheering).","The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.","Unlike in the show, Sansa never befriends Shae and does not trust her. Shae does whatever Sansa tells her, but sometimes she gives Sansa very insolent looks. Sansa has no idea why, for she does not know Shae is her husband's lover.","Sansa believes that her marriage to Tyrion is valid, as she reminds Littlefinger on the fourth novel when he reveals his plans to marry her to Harrold Hardyng. It is unclear whether Sansa knows her marriage can be annulled; Littlefinger never brings up this option. He assures her it is not a problem, her intended marriage must wait until \"Cersei is done and Sansa\u2019s safely widowed\". "],"name":"Sansa Stark","description":"When she lived at Winterfell with her family, Sansa grew up as the eldest daughter of a Great House, trying to emulate her mother's example of a \"proper lady\" from the southern courts. Sansa's devotion to the traditional, refined \"feminine virtues\" caused friction between her and her blunt, tomboyish younger sister Arya, with whom she had a playful rivalry. As a little girl, Sansa naively believed in the tales and epic romances in which every princess gets her honorable knight in shining armor to sweep her off her feet. Sansa was infatuated with the traditional romances about mythical figures like Jonquil, and historical figures like Duncan, the Prince of Dragonflies. Her greatest goal in life was to be married to a heroic and handsome prince, sitting around with other noblewomen eating lemon cakes while gossiping about the goings-on at court.\n\nSansa's innocent infatuation with the ideals of princesses and knights - perfectly understandable for a 13-year-old girl - made her tragically susceptible to the manipulations of the Lannisters. She held the blind belief that all queens and princes are kind and truthful, as if inherently a result of their titles, when Cersei just happened to be a woman who married a king to secure a marriage alliance, and Joffrey just happened to be her son. Without real cause, she blindly loved Joffrey with all her heart, and trusted and admired Cersei, only for them to repay her love and trust by beheading her father before her very eyes.\n\nAfterwards, Sansa has a harrowing experience as a prisoner of the Lannisters, a plaything for the psychopathic Joffrey to have publicly beaten by his guards for petty amusement. Her shock at the death of her father was only later deepened at the news of how her mother and brother Robb were horrifically killed at the Red Wedding and their corpses desecrated. She was visibly elated upon hearing that Arya, Bran, and Rickon were actually still alive, and though she took mostly after her mother and had a somewhat distant relationship with Jon, she loved him all the same. She was surprised to hear that Jon had become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and Jon was the first person for her to decide to turn to for shelter after escaping Winterfell, aware that he would protect her from Ramsay.\n\nSansa subsequently escapes King's Landing to the Vale with Littlefinger, and her experiences have clearly changed her personality. She had to learn from painful experience how to lie to survive at Joffrey's court, saying one thing but meaning another and manipulating people to her own ends as best she could. No longer under constant control by Joffrey and Cersei's guards, she is in her own way beginning to mature into her own power and influence as a political force.\n\nThe numerous tragedies she has suffered, and the crimes against herself and her family, have also darkened her personality turning her more ruthless, though not quite cruel. This shows when she refuses to take Theon's arm when he comes to escort her to the Godswood to marry Ramsay and coldly asks if he thinks she cares what Ramsay will do to him if she doesn't. She also later expresses approval of what Ramsay did to Theon, now Reek, and declares she would do the same. Once reclaiming Winterfell, Sansa feeds her abusive husband, Ramsay to his own hounds, even smiling as it happened.\n\nHowever, despite all the suffering that she has been through, Sansa appears to have retained a certain degree of compassion that is also demonstrated in her multiple attempts at reaching out to Theon, especially after she gets him to finally forget Ramsay for once and confess the truth about Bran and Rickon. After Theon helps her escape from Winterfell, Sansa once again sees Theon as a surrogate brother and even says outright that she will do her best to stop Jon from harming him. Sansa also becomes more compassionate towards Jon, to the point that she apologizes to him for being \"awful\" to him when they were children; she may developed feelings of remorse for being generally mean to her half-brother, as shown when she insists for him to forgive her. She has also become significantly more brave, courageous and developing nerves of iron, since when she faced Myranda for the last time before her escape from Winterfell she was about to allow the psychopathic girl to shoot her so that she could die with as much of herself as was remaining.\n\nAll the pain she had suffered through has made Sansa stronger and more mature, but also more war-like. No more caring about the traditional feminine virtues she used to praise as a child, Sansa even declares war against Ramsay in order to take back Winterfell and the North, and flat out rejects his conditions for saving her brother Rickon, knowing full well he would never keep his word anyway, and instead tells him that he will die the next day. Her experiences with the Lannisters have also enabled her to watch with dark glee as Ramsay is literally torn apart and eaten by his own hounds, while when she first arrived in King's Landing she was visibly horrified at the violence displayed by Gregor Clegane against Ser Hugh and Loras Tyrell, and fainted when her father was beheaded. When she is granted the title of Lady of Winterfell she soon proves herself to be an effective leader, maintaining order and preparing the North for winter with such effectiveness many of the Lords decide she should have been named Queen instead.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sansa_Stark"}}

If a king is newly established (through conquest, usurpation, or declaring independence) his children will become princes, but it is variable if his brothers become princes. For example, after Robert Baratheon usurped the crown, his younger brothers remained as \"Lords\" but not \"Princes\". In contrast, when Robb Stark declared the North an independent kingdom again, he and his followers considered all of his younger siblings to be \"Princes\" and \"Princesses\"."],"name":"Prince","description":"During the rule of House Targaryen, all members of the royal family, except for the King and Queen, held the title of Prince or Princess.\n\nThe heir to the Iron Throne held the title of Prince of Dragonstone, and ruled the former seat of House Targaryen, with the noble houses sworn to Dragonstone as vassals.\n\nDuring the rule of House Baratheon, however, only the offspring of King Robert Baratheon held the titles of Prince or Princess. Meanwhile, his brothers, despite being officially in the line of succession didn't hold the titles.\n\nDespite the fact that Queen Mother Cersei Lannister ascends to the throne following the extinction of House Baratheon, her twin brother  Ser Jaime Lannister, who, as her closest living male relative, could be considered the heir apparent , is not referred to as \"Prince\" in any way ; her younger brother Tyrion has been long branded as traitor to the realm and collaborates with the invader Daenerys Targaryen, therefore it makes sense that he is considered stripped of all potential titles.\n\nWhen Robb Stark was proclaimed the new King in the North by his bannermen during the War of the Five Kings, his four younger siblings were officially considered to be Princes and Princesses of his new realm. Prince Bran Stark briefly ruled Winterfell in Robb's absence as his legal heir, alongside the youngest Stark child, Rickon Stark.\n\nRobb's sisters also technically became Princesses, but in practice were rarely referred to in person by the title. Sansa Stark remained a prisoner of the Lannisters in King's Landing, who did not acknowledge the independence of the North, and therefore would not encourage this by referring to Sansa as a princess (anymore than they would acknowledge that Robb was a king). Arya Stark, meanwhile, escaped King's Landing but went on the run through the Riverlands under assumed identities, and thus didn't insist that others call her by her real name, much less that she was a princess. Robb and his mother Catelyn, at the Stark camp, do refer to Sansa and Arya as \"princesses\" when discussing them, but this never occurs in face-to-face relations.\n\nAfter Jon Snow is hailed as King in the North following the Battle of the Bastards and the Kingdom of the North is thus re-established with House Stark as the royal family, his surviving \"siblings\"-Sansa, Arya and Bran- are presumably again elevated to the status of Princes and Princesses, however none of them is addressed as such yet; Sansa, now Lady Stark and Lady of Winterfell, is addressed and referred to as either of these two, while Bran and Arya, who were publicly thought dead for years, have only just returned home.\n\nWhen Balon Greyjoy uses the opportunity of the War of the Five Kings to declare the Iron Islands independent once again, his two surviving children gain the title. The Kingship of the Iron Islands, however, has historically operated under a unique system of elected kingship. Even in times when the crown was hereditary, the exact system was often uncertain. Thus there is jockeying for position over who exactly is Balon's heir depending on what system they are using: whether it should be his eldest son (Theon), his eldest child (his daughter Yara), or if his younger brothers should be considered next in line of succession, ahead of his children.\n\nTheon Greyjoy also stylized himself (Ruling) Prince of Winterfell after he captured and held the castle for a short period of time. \u200B\n\nHouse Martell still rule Dorne as Princes. The head of the family holds the title of Prince of Dorne; or Princess in case of female rulers; while the rest of the family hold the titles of Prince or Princess.\n\nWhile the title \"Prince\" in other parts of the Seven Kingdoms is typically used to indicate the heir to the throne, Dorne has ruling Princes (or ruling Princesses). This is a holdover from centuries ago when the Rhoynar ruled city-states along the Rhoyne River in Essos. Dorne had a ruling Prince when it was an independent kingdom, and only unified with the Targaryen realm one century ago; not through conquest but through marriage. As a result of this voluntary union, the Martell rulers of Dorne were allowed to continue to style themselves as \"Princes\" even though they are no longer the absolute sovereign.\n\nIn the Free City of Pentos, the nominal ruler is a Prince, a figurehead ruler chosen by the Magisters of the city.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Prince"}}

She formed it in response to Aegon II taking over their father's Small Council in King's Landing itself, which was correspondingly known as the Green Council."],"name":"Black Council","description":"The Green Council was mostly formed of the members of King Viserys I's Small Council at the time of his death - which had come to be dominated by the Greens, the court faction of Viserys I's second wife, Queen Alicent Hightower. Of the seven men on that Small Council, only one was still openly loyal to Rhaenyra: Lyman Beesbury, the old Master of Coin who had served at court for many years and was determined to honor Viserys I's direct orders that Rhaenyra would succeed him to the throne. At the emergency Small Council meeting called upon Viserys I's death in his sleep, Beesbury alone refused to acquiesce to Aegon II usurping the throne - upon which Criston Cole promptly snuck up behind him and slit his throat.\n\nIn response, Rhaenyra formed her own Small Council from her seat on Dragonstone island. Due to the death of Beesbury, none of them were previous members of the old Small Council. Indeed it was a much more ad hoc council and it doesn't appear she formally appointed members into all seven traditional Small Council positions.\n\nRhaenyra's Small Council were her own immediate advisors at court, not necessarily all of the major leaders of \"the Blacks\" during the civil war, i.e. Cregan Stark wasn't a member of the council but continued to rule at Winterfell while contributing House Stark's armies to the war.\n\nAt the outset of the Dance:\n\nnull\n\nRhaenyra's youngest two sons, Aegon the Younger and Viserys II, were only little boys and not included in the council.\n\nRhaenys, Jacaerys, and Lucerys died during the first half of the war, but then Rhaenyra's faction captured King's Landing from the Greens and held it for about half a year. It is unknown if she more formally established other offices of the traditional Small Council during that time.\n\nRhaenyra's rival Small Council was much more loosely formed than Aegon II's (which was largely inherited from the end of their father's reign): it had more than seven members as just \"advisors\" while not bothering to formally appoint all seven traditional positions.\n\nDaemon Targaryen was named Protector of the Realm in Rhaenyra's stead, meaning he was the formal commander of her armies (usually the title is held by the monarch personally but at times has been handed to a more experienced commander, which Daemon certainly was). Daemon was not Rhaenyra's Hand of the King, however: that office was given to Corlys Velaryon (in this case termed \"Hand of the Queen\"). Corlys may have also doubled as Rhaenyra's Master of Ships but it hasn't been stated if she formally gave out the position.\n\nThe maester appointed to Dragonstone who had served Rhaenyra faithfully for many years was Gerardys. He was also on the council and apparently she considered him her Grand Maester, though in practice a monarch cannot hand out that title, only Conclave can.\n\nWhile Viserys I's Small Council was not split in the civil war (except for Beesbury, who was killed immediately), the Kingsguard did split between the two factions: four sided with Aegon II while three fled and joined Rhaenyra on Dragonstone. These three become the core of Rhaenyra's rival Queensgard - chief among them was Steffon Darklyn, whom Rhaenyra appointed as its Lord Commander.\n\nOtherwise it is unknown if Rhaenyra ever formally appointed a Master of Coin, Master of Whisperers, or Master of Laws, even after she took King's Landing.\n\nThere were also about half a dozen other minor lords of the lands around Blackwater Bay who were bannermen to Dragonstone itself that also made up the Black council. They were not significant players in the narrative, and the Season 5 Blu-ray featurette on the Dance of the Dragons simply leaves out mention of them. These included Bertimos Celtigar of Claw Isle, Lord Staunton of Rook's Rest, Lord Darklyn of Duskendale, Gormon Massey of Stonedance, and Lord Bar Emmon of Sharp Point.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Black_Council"}}

Therefore it is forbidden to draw a sword while in the city, under penalty of death. However, the restriction is specifically on drawing a bladed weapon or shedding blood (which is considered sacrilege): should the need arise, it is permissible to kill someone in the city using other lethal means, i.e. strangulation or burning. Even so, due to the respect the Dothraki have for the city, violence within it is rare."],"name":"Vaes Dothrak","description":"null\n\nThe location of Vaes Dothrak in the title sequence of Game of Thrones is erroneous. Later maps show the city lying in farther in the east of Essos, while the title sequence map shows it much closer to the center of the Dothraki sea. George R.R. Martin did not provide detailed maps for the Dothraki Sea until well into production of the second season.\n\nDue to changes in filming locations, Vaes Dothrak looks markedly different in Season 6, appearing much drier - in-universe this could be explained by a change in season - and hemmed in by cliffs which were absent in Season 1.\n\nAccording to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, \"Vaes Dothrak\" is pronounced \"VIE-iss Doth-RACK\", as opposed to \"Vays Doth-RACK\", etc. \"Vaes\" is pronounced as two distinct syllables.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daenerys Targaryen travels east to Vaes Dothrak to gain acceptance and approval for her marriage to Khal Drogo. This frustrates her brother Viserys, since Vaes Dothrak is a thousand miles or more in the \"wrong\" direction as his desire is to sail west to invade Westeros immediately. Vaes Dothrak lies close to the Mother of Mountains and a lake known by the Dothraki as the Womb of the World, from where, according to Dothraki myth, the first man emerged riding the first horse a thousand years ago.\n\nIt is forbidden to draw a bladed steel weapon in Vaes Dothrak, under penalty of death. The TV series mentions this with regard to people, but the book goes on to establish that it is even forbidden to use steel blades to butcher animals. Thus when Drogo and his bloodriders had to slaughter a stallion so Daenerys could eat its heart in a Dothraki religious ritual, they had to butcher it using stone knives.\n\nThe city is both very large and very small: it is physically large enough to hold every khalasar if they return all at once (for special religious ceremonies, etc.). Daenerys estimates that it physically has ten times as many buildings as Pentos does. However, there are rarely more than a few khalasars stopping in the city at any one time, before leaving again to find plunder. As a result, the permanent population of the city isn't much compared to one of the Free Cities or to a Westerosi city such as King's Landing.\n\nVaes Dothrak has actually become a major trade hub for the west-east overland caravan routes across Essos, which want to avoid the high tolls on sea trade that Qarth exacts to the south. The Western Market is filled with traders from the Free Cities, who may sell wares which indirectly originated in Westeros (e.g. Westerosi wines from the Arbor). The Eastern market contains traders from more exotic lands from the east such as Qarth, Yi Ti, the plains of the Jogos Nhai, and even Asshai and the Shadow Lands. The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) explains that overland caravans from the Free Cities depart from and return to the easternmost Free City, Qohor. As a result Qohor is one of the more exotic of the Free Cities, with a large amount of trade items obtained from distant lands such as Yi Ti itself.\n\nThe novels specify that the market is actually more for the merchants from the west and east to trade with each other - thus explaining how the Dothraki can be said to \"not believe in money\" yet still have a large marketplace in their capital city. The foreign merchants gift tribute to the dosh khaleen (of salt, silver, and seed) in return for being allowed to trade in the city, as well as promise of safe passage across the Dothraki Sea. Sometimes Dothraki might visit the market to obtain something interesting (e.g. Daenerys and her handmaidens), but on the whole the entire business of trade and commerce seems alien to the horselords.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Vaes_Dothrak"}}

After House Bolton is defeated at the Battle of the Bastards, she is the first to declare Jon Snow the King in the North during a gathering of the Northern lords at Winterfell.","Lyanna Mormont is the daughter of Maege Mormont. She was named for Lyanna Stark, who died years before she was born. After her mother's older brother Jeor joined the Night's Watch and his only son Jorah exiled to Essos, Maege Mormont became Lady of Bear Island.

Jon had given Stannis advice that the Northern vassals wouldn't just declare for him and send soldiers to his army at the Wall: instead he needed to take her army out and help the Northerners drive out their shared enemies, to win their allegiance by fighting side by side with them. Stannis writes a letter back to Jon recounting the battle: \"we had other help, unexpected but most welcome, from a daughter of Bear Island.

During Robert's Rebellion, after Viserys's older brother Rhaegar was killed at the Battle of the Trident, his father sent Viserys and his pregnant mother Queen Rhaella to safety on Dragonstone island. King Aerys was soon afterwards killed during the Sack of King's Landing along with Rhaegar's widow and children, and thus at the age of only five Viserys became the titular head of House Targaryen, though by this point the war was officially lost. Not long afterwards, his mother died in childbirth, while the forces of Robert Baratheon closed in on the island. Before they could arrive, Viserys and his baby sister Daenerys were smuggled to safety in the Free Cities, across the Narrow Sea on the continent of Essos.

He was condescending, violent, arrogant, immoral and extremely cruel. He suffered from maniacal delusions of grandeur, and was intensely self-righteous. Much like Joffrey Baratheon, Viserys believed that people should obey him simply in regards to status and, in his view, birthright. Viserys was a violent and aggressive man, and described his temper as 'a dragon', but also referring to himself as such, showing that he believes he is the greatest of the Targaryens. Viserys's temper hopelessly outweighs his common sense, making him rash and exceptionally reckless.\n\nViserys also held extremely little regard for either the safety or opinions of others. An example of this was him promising Jorah Mormont that he would not be punished for trading in slaves when he was king and even implied that he would become involved in it, ignoring or discarding the fact that slavery has been forbidden and condemned in Westeros since before there were even Seven Kingdoms. Viserys was also extremely self-deluded and believed himself to be a mighty warrior, something akin to his brother Rhaegar Targaryen, but in actuality he had never wielded a sword against an opponent in his life and didn't truly know the first thing about combat, strategy or warfare, only ever seeing the moment where he would gloriously sit upon the Iron Throne as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms\n\nIn regards to his sister Daenerys, Viserys is extremely cruel to her - Viserys does not regard her as a human being with emotions and rights, but rather as a property for him to abuse or hand out to others whenever he pleases. He constantly beats and abuses her verbally, and levels her self-esteem regardless of her human nature. He also viewed her derogatively as a whore to Khal Drogo, not measuring her intelligence or empathy or promise in favor of her being another bridge for him to step over in order to take Westeros for himself. Viserys, nevertheless, self-righteously believes that she is loyal to him and nobody else, shown by the fact that, before his death, he begs for her to help him, despite him giving her absolutely no moral provocation to do so. In fact, only moments before, he had threatened to cut her open with a sword during her pregnancy.\n\nViserys has been shown to be similar to his own father, with his appearance and personality being good examples of this.\n\nDaenerys believes that the loss of their mother, father and brother and having to beg everyone for money and shelter has driven Viserys mad, due to him being kind and respectful to her once. She clearly once had some affection for him as her only living blood relative, and in tribute to that she named her dragon Viserion after him.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Viserys_Targaryen"}}

This code states that knights must defend the weak and the innocent, must protect women and children, must fight fairly and honorably, and obey their lieges. How closely a knight follows this code varies immensely from individual to individual. It is difficult to obey one law while trying to uphold the other."],"name":"Knighthood","description":"Knighthood originated in Andal culture, and was introduced to Westeros during the Andal Invasion six thousand years ago. As a result of this, knighthood is intimately tied to the Faith of the Seven, and the ideal of knighthood is to be not only an honorable warrior but a devout follower of the Seven. And with any knight, honorable conduct and level of piety varies from person to person.\n\nThe Faith of the Seven is the dominant religion in all but two of the kingdoms: the North (whose inhabitants still worship the Old Gods of the Forest) and the Iron Islands (who follow a local deity called the Drowned God). The institution of knighthood is therefore not heavily practiced in these two regions, and very few Northerners or Ironborn ever choose to become knights, even if they are renowned warriors. For example, Eddard Stark himself was not a knight, because he proudly continued to worship the Old Gods of his ancestors, yet he was still a great warrior. Sometimes, however, a soldier who does not follow the Faith of the Seven may nonetheless be rewarded for exemplary service with the title of knighthood by a lord who does worship the Seven. Examples are Ser Rodrik Cassel and Ser Jorah Mormont, both of the North.\n\nBecause it is tied to the Faith of the Seven, knighthood does not exist in other cultures outside of the Seven Kingdoms, either among the wildlings beyond the Wall, nor across the Narrow Sea in other continents such as Essos (though of course, a knight from the Seven Kingdoms may travel to the Free Cities).\n\nTypically, young men must undergo many years of extensive and expensive training to become a knight. A young knight-in-training is known as a \"Squire\".\n\nPursuing a knighthood is one of the few ways for a member of the smallfolk to achieve rank and standing amongst the nobility. However, such a task usually involves the expenditure of significant sums of money on armor and weaponry which puts it out of the reach of most commoners. The rank of knighthood is not hereditary, and thus a knight's sons must go through the whole process of becoming knights themselves. Of course, a commoner who has been knighted will have greater opportunity to gain the wealth needed to put his sons through training as knights.\n\nIt is not unheard of, however, for commoners to be knighted after significantly distinguishing themselves in combat. This skips the typically large costs of training to be a knight, though it happens more often in wartime. During Robert's Rebellion, Stannis Baratheon knighted Davos Seaworth as a reward for saving his castle garrison at the Siege of Storm's End - albeit this was a rare case in which Davos's bravery was not in combat, but in running the blockade around the castle to bring food to the starving garrison.\n\nEven a common sellsword that has fought valiantly in combat may be rewarded by being dubbed a knight, though this occurs infrequently. For example, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was knighted after the Battle of the Blackwater for the vital role he played in setting the wildfire trap which destroyed much of the attacking enemy fleet.\n\nIn theory, all knights hold an equal rank, but in practice knights who own their own lands or who serve major lords are much more highly respected than a landless commoner who happened to be knighted after fighting valiantly in a battle. It is also seen as more prestigious to be knighted by a king, a major lord, a Kingsguard, or another highly respected knight. Any knight can theoretically make another man a knight if he is willing to say the vows, though respectable knights would not hand out the title lightly. A sellsword might get knighted for fighting well in a battle, and he might dishonorably knight all of his drinking companions who did nothing to earn it. They would technically hold the title of \"knight\", but no one would take their title seriously due to the low prestige of how they became knighted.\n\nMost often, young men who have finished their training and just recently been knighted are landless and not in the service of any lord. There are three stages of service that knights hope to work their way up through:\n\nnull\n\nIn wartime, mounted knights form the backbone of major armies in southern Westeros. A single knight is an elite professional soldier, with extensive combat training, and equipped with the finest weapons and heavy armor. A single knight, even dismounted, is worth several dozen poorly armed and untrained common foot soldiers conscripted as feudal levies. Knights are very useful for carving through and running down enemy infantry, though they are also the best weapon against the enemy army's own mounted knights.\n\nIn peacetime, knights prove their martial valor through training and contests of skill known as tournaments (although knighthood is not always a formal requirement for participation in a tournament). The highlight of tournaments is the joust, in which mounted knights charge at each other, each knight trying to knock the other off of his horse using a wooden lance. Knights at tournaments frequently fight to win the favor of noble ladies if they prove victorious. While some knights do fight for such romantic reasons, others are more interested in the large money prizes awarded to the winners, often consisting of several hundred to several thousand Gold Dragons. Others fight at tournaments to win general social prestige, or for the excitement of victory, though a few, such as Ser Gregor Clegane, fight simply because they enjoy violence.\n\nKnights often formally swear fealty to lords by exchanging formulaic vows. In one commonly used formula, the knight kneels before a lord in supplication while holding up his sword in offering, and they give the following exchange:\n\nMen who have been knighted, even those not originally from noble Houses, gain the legal right to display their own personal heraldry.\n\nSince the Targaryen Conquest three hundred years before the War of the Five Kings, the seven-man royal bodyguard known as the Kingsguard have been considered to be the pinnacle of knighthood. In theory, the Kingsguard are the elite of the elite, more skilled at combat and more honorable and virtuous than any other knights in the entire realm. At times, this ideal has been matched, in great and honorable knights such as the legendary Ser Barristan Selmy. Other times, Kingsguard members have been skilled warriors but behaved controversially, such as Ser Jaime Lannister. In the worst occasions, some Kingsguard members were appointed simply as political favors, and are neither honorable nor particularly talented fighters, such as Ser Meryn Trant.\n\nMounted Westerosi knights on heavy horse typically charge enemy infantry formations using war lances. Cavalry charges can devastatingly kill a large number of infantry drastically out of proportion to the number of cavalry present.\n\nOn foot, the fighting style of Westerosi knights consists of powerful slashing attacks and strong blocks using a heavy sword, alternating with quick thrusting attacks meant to penetrate armor. Westerosi knights wear heavy plate armor which provides them excellent protection, particularly against the crude weapons of basic infantry conscripts, albeit at the cost of making their movements relatively slow. The weight of their armor slows them down enough that they cannot rely on speed to win against unarmored opponents (though the armor will keep them alive longer than their opponent), thus knights must rely on the raw power of blows from heavy swords, designed to deal damage not only due to their sharpness but their sheer weight. Broad hacking and slashing movements are not merely dramatic, but combined with the raw weight of the sword, will drastically increase the force behind the impact of the blow. A lightly armed and armored opponent may hit a knight multiple times but for little damage. Conversely, it may take a knight some time to pin down an unarmored opponent, but once he does, his blow will be absolutely devastating. The agility of a knight also depends highly on its wearer, as veteran fighters are often seen to be moderately unrestricted by their armor.\n\nThe greatest threat to armored knights is actually other armored knights, and their weapon design and fighting style evolved to reflect this. The best way to penetrate through plate armor is with a thrusting attack using a long, heavy sword. A curved blade could not apply as much pressure on a single point, and a thinner blade would snap under so much pressure. For comparison, the Dothraki arakh sword is meant to be used by light cavalry while running down unarmored infantry, thus the blade has a curved design to provide greater reach in slashing attacks, which can be made very rapidly because the blade itself is light and thin. The arakh was not designed to punch through plate armor, however, and at this task it pales in comparison to a knight's straight and heavy longsword. Thrusting attacks are best at actually penetrating armor, but the sheer force behind a powerful slashing attack is often still quite useful against even an armored opponent, as the force of the blow may stun him, possibly dent his armor, and sometimes outright cleave through weaker plate armor. Sometimes penetrating a high quality suit of armor is almost impossible, even with strong thrusts. In this case, impact weapons such as warhammers or maces are good at delivering powerful blows that can crush bones without actually having to penetrate the armor. By far, the best way of dealing with an armored opponent is to simply attack the areas in which there is little or no armor.\n\nBecause combat between Westerosi knights is not quite as fast as Dothraki wielding arakhs, or the Water Dance fighting style of the Free Cities which uses light rapiers, it values not only quick reflexes but strategy. Instead of rapid attacks meant to land a blow before the opponent can react, a Westerosi knight must often engage in an elaborate series of feints, trying to gradually lure the opposing knight into overcommitting his defense to one side, then landing a devastating attack on the other side. Nonetheless, speed is still very much a factor in combat between knights, and the knight who is both physically and mentally faster will emerge victorious.\n\nNo one fighting style is universally superior to another, simply better suited to different purposes, and the skill of the individual is often the ultimate deciding factor in combat. For example, equipped with plate armor and a heavy sword Ser Jorah Mormont was able to defeat Qotho the Dothraki bloodrider, who was unarmored and wielding an arakh. Qotho did manage to land a strike against Jorah's side, but his armor absorbed the blow, as a slashing attack from a thin blade cannot penetrate plate armor. Jorah then used his arm to pin the arakh against his side, and proceeded to land a killing blow with his own sword. Similarly, Ser Meryn Trant was able to defeat the much more skilled fighter Syrio Forel, because his armor provided him complete protection from all the blows the famed First Sword of Braavos managed to land with his lead-filled wooden sword. This was in contrast to the fates of several Lannister men-at-arms who have tried conclusion with Syrio moments earlier, and had their jaws and knees effortlessly broken because they had no armor over these body parts.\n\nConversely, the sellsword Bronn eschewed heavy armor when fighting in a trial by combat against Ser Vardis Egen. Unlike Qotho, Bronn did not attempt to immediately land a strike on his opponent, but focused on dodging and avoiding Vardis's attacks until the knight tired himself out, at which point Bronn moved in for a quick incapacitating strike.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, knighthood is an institution that came with the Andals when they invaded Westeros some six thousand years ago. Knights wore armor (derived from iron) and rode horses into battle, using massed-formation charges and lances to shatter enemy armies. The devastating effectiveness of this tactic permitted the Andals to conquer most of Westeros. This tactic was later adopted by others, so the cavalry of the North uses much the same weapons, armor and tactics as knights, but are not called knights due to their devotion to another god. In practice, there is little difference between knights and Northern heavy cavalry.\n\nThere are several types of knight:\n\nnull\n\nMost knights pass through three stages to achieve the rank. They start as pages, young boys who perform menial tasks for their lieges. Pages are not expected to fight in battle, but some do regardless. They are given lessons in riding and weapons in return. Upon reaching adolescence, pages become Squires. Their training intensifies and they are taught the full comportment and responsibilities of knighthood. Squires are expected to fight in battle and carry themselves as knights at all times, even though they have not achieved the rank yet. They finally become full knights after they have proven themselves.\n\nIn theory any knight can make another man a knight, though in practice it is considered more prestigious to be famous and respected knights, particularly those actually commanding a campaign. The highest honor is to be knighted by one of the Kingsguard. There have been times when landless hedge knights of no merit dubbed dozens of their followers as \"knights\" simply as a favor, but this is considered an extremely disreputable practice. The comparison that George R.R. Martin has used is that being \"knighted\" is similar to being a \"college graduate\" - exactly how prestigious your degree is depends on where you received it. Technically, a student at Harvard or Oxford and a student at a local community college are both \"college graduates\", but there is a drastic difference between the two. Analogously, it is more prestigious to be knighted by the Kingsguard or a famous and revered knight, while a peasant knighted by a hedge knight of no fame would be scoffed at as not being a \"real\" knight at all.\n\nThus the full course for a prospective knight is: Page-->Squire-->Hedge Knight-->Sworn Sword-->Landed Knight. A man does not necessarily have to go through the first two steps to become a knight: if a commoner has significantly distinguished himself in combat, a knight may choose to elevate him to knighthood. Even a sellsword that has fought valiantly in combat may be rewarded by being dubbed a knight, though this is uncommon.\n\nFurther, a soldier who is rewarded by a lord for valorous service by being dubbed a knight might instantly be taken on by that lord as a sworn sword within his own household, skipping the hedge knight step. Further, while rare, it is not unheard of for a lord to reward a common soldier not only by dubbing him a knight, but by at the same time giving him lands, instantly elevating him from a simple soldier to a \"landed knight\" and member of the minor nobility, skipping the steps of \"hedge knight\" or \"sworn sword\" entirely. This was the case with Ser Davos Seaworth, who was a common low-born smuggler, but performed such valorous service running the blockade around Storm's End to bring food to the besieged castle's starving garrison, that Stannis Baratheon rewarded him by not only knighting him but giving him lands to rule.\n\nBecoming a knight requires the applicant to swear an oath of allegiance and fealty to the Seven and to stand vigil in a sept for a night (these tasks need not be performed consecutively: it is not uncommon in times of war for a newly-made knight to not stand his vigil for weeks or months).\n\nThere is no formal bar against women becoming knights, only that it is simply not done. There is no \"official\" rule against women becoming knights, because it makes as much sense in their culture as making an official rule forbidding pigs to fly: it is absurd and simply impossible for a woman to be a knight. While rare, female warriors have served as pages and squires.\n\n\"Ser\" is not a typo: the title for knights within the fictional universe of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series is spelled \"S-e-r\" with an \"e\", not as \"sir\" with an \"i\" as in real life. This is just a quirk of their culture. In A Feast for Crows, however, it is once misspelled as \"Sir\".\n\nAccording to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, \"Ser\" is pronounced \"SAIR\". Actors usually say it very fast or slur it so it sounds very similar to the standard \"sir\", but this is not the case. That is, actor Sean Bean isn't saying \"sir\" with a Received Pronunciation accent so it sounds like \"SAIR\", the correct pronunciation of \"ser\" actually is \"SAIR\". Writer Bryan Cogman clarified that some pronunciations would differ due to the accents and languages of the speaker, \"Ser\" in particular.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Knighthood"}}

After Gilly and Samwell Tarly notice that her new baby is a boy, they realize that Craster will want to sacrifice him to the White Walkers.\n\nSam visits Gilly, who is deeply distraught about the impending fate of her newborn son. She is frantic, and yells at Sam not to draw attention to his gender, as Craster will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out. He asks her if she has decided on a name, but she responds that there is no point in naming her baby if he is only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice. She gives Sam back his mother's thimble and says she doesn't care about such stupid things, and is focused only on protecting the life of her baby.\n\nWhen a mutiny breaks out that results in the deaths of Craster and Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, Sam rushes to Gilly's hut and tells her that they must leave. Sam runs out of Craster's Keep with Gilly and her baby, as loyal Night's Watch members fall to the mutineers, who also kill or rape Craster's other wives. Gilly leads the way into the night because she knows the woods around her home.\n\nAfter several days of travelling, Sam, Gilly, and her baby arrived at an abandoned cabin in a forest. After lighting a fire, Sam suggests that Gilly name her son but she does not know any boy names. Sam gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. They are interrupted by the squawks of several crows outside. When Sam and Gilly, who is carrying the baby, went out to investigate, they saw hundreds of crows squawking angrily at them. Shortly later, Gilly witnesses a White Walker approaching and realized that the creature has come for the baby due to Craster's habit of sacrificing male babies to these creatures. Sam manages to kill the White Walker with a dragonglass dagger. The three of them then flee into the night.\n\nFollowing their encounter with the White Walker, Sam's mother Gilly and her protector Samwell continue their journey to Castle Black, the headquarters of the Night's Watch. Based on Samwell's knowledge of the roads and places in the North, they head for Nightfort, an abandoned castle which was formerly the headquarters of the Night's Watch and is situated between Castle Black and Beyond the Wall. After travelling past the Wall, Sam and the adults finally reach Nightfort, where they encounter Bran Stark, the half-brother of Samwell's friend Jon Snow. Bran and his companions\u2014Jojen Reed and his sister Meera, the servant Hodor and the direwolf Summer are travelling Beyond the Wall in search of the three-eyed raven.\n\nDue to their experiences beyond the Wall, Samwell and Gilly are not willing to return to the Wall with Bran and company. They part company, and Sam and the adults complete their journey to Castle Black. There, they met Maester Aemon, who is furious at the prospect that Samwell has violated his vows. However, Aemon's demeanor softens upon learning that Gilly was one of the late Craster's wives and that Sam is one of his offspring. Aemon acknowledges that Gilly is now a refugee and that she and her child should be sheltered since the North is no longer safe for humans. Aemon then orders Sam to begin writing letters immediately and to make sure that all forty-four of Castle Black's ravens are well-fed, as every one of them will fly that night: the White Walkers have returned, and Westeros must be warned. For the moment, Sam and his mother are safe from the White Walkers.\n\nWorried about Gilly and her baby, Samwell Tarly has them sent away to Mole's Town. Gilly is given work at the local brothel.\n\nA whore is annoyed that Gilly's baby woke her up during a night in Mole's Town. Meanwhile, a wildling raiding party, including Tormund, Styr, and Ygritte, attack the town, killing everyone in their path. Ygritte discovers Gilly hiding with her baby, but urges them to keep quiet, sparing their lives.\n\nGilly and her baby flee to the safety of Castle Black. Sam is overjoyed to see them and has them hide in a storage room for the duration of the battle.\n\nLittle Sam remains with his mother Gilly at Castle Black. However, Gilly is fearful that she and her baby may be sent away if Ser Alliser Thorne is chosen as the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.\n\nOn his deathbed, Maester Aemon fondly interacts with Little Sam, recalling that his younger brother Egg had a jolly laugh just like him when he was a baby. His strength failing, he also warns Gilly that she must go south with her baby before it is too late - winter is almost upon them and the White Walkers will come with it to attack the Wall.\n\nSam asks Jon if he can travel to Oldtown to study and replace Aemon as the new maester for Castle Black, as he feels there is no other way he can help them as he cannot fight. He also wishes to take Gilly and little Sam with him, in order to protect them from the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon allows this and Sam, Gilly and little Sam depart shortly after.\n\nLittle Sam accompanies his mother Gilly and Samwell Tarly on a sea voyage to Oldtown in the Reach. Since the Citadel only admits men within its walls, Samwell plans to send Sam and his mother to live with his family at Horn Hill. Samwell is unwilling to abandon Sam and his mother to the tender mercies of the streets of Oldtown.\n\nAfter landing in Oldtown, Little Sam, Gilly, and Samwell travel by station coach to the Tarly family home at Horn Hill. To protect Gilly, Samwell claims that she was a Northern woman he had bedded in Mole's Town and that Little Sam is his son. Upon arriving at Horn Hill, Sam and the adults are welcomed by Samwell's mother Melessa and his sister Talla Tarly, the former of whom Sam seems to like. While Melessa and Talla are friendly and hospitable, Samwell's father Randyll Tarly is hostile and derides Sam's mother for being a Wildling. Later that night, Samwell steals the family heirloom Heartsbane and flees Horn Hill with both Gilly and Little Sam.\n\nAfter arriving in Oldtown, Sam and Gilly meet a Citadel maester. Sam gives him a letter from Lord Commander Snow about Sam becoming a maester for the Night's Watch, but the maester is skeptical about Jon Snow's state, saying that no word was given about Lord Commander Mormont's death from Maester Aemon. The maester states that Sam's situation is \"irregular\" to which Sam responds, \"Life is irregular.\" The maester then says that Sam must speak to the Archmaester in order to discuss these issues. The maester then allows Sam to use the library, but blocks Gilly and Little Sam from entering.\n\nLittle Sam and his mother Gilly stay in Oldtown while Samwell studies at the Citadel nearby. While Sam plays with his mother, Samwell discovers that mines of dragonglass can be found beneath Dragonstone.

The Children only partially succeeded, flooding the Neck and turning its territories into a massive swamp but not submerging it entirely.

The crannogmen were eventually unified by one ruler known as the Marsh King.\n\nMany centuries later, this tiny independent kingdom was conquered by the rising power of House Stark of Winterfell, the Kings of Winter, who were determined to unite the entire North as one realm, though the crannogmen put up determined resistance. Ultimately the Starks defeated the last Marsh King, and married his daughter to secure control of the Neck.

He has not yet met Tyrion Lannister."],"name":"Grey Worm","description":"Grey Worm was originally a boy taken into slavery by the Good Masters of Astapor, an oligarchy of slave-traders dedicated to the training and commerce of Unsullied, warrior-eunuch slaves trained into absolute obedience since early childhood. It later is revealed that he is originally from the Summer Islands and was taken by the slavers in a raid as a baby. He has no memory of his life before being an Unsullied.\n\nHe is released from slavery after Daenerys Targaryen buys all the Unsullied in the city and has them put all slave owners in Astapor to the sword and release all slaves. Once released, Grey Worm, like all his brethren, chooses to fight for Daenerys as a free man.\n\nAs per Daenerys's instructions, the Unsullied officers select their own leader to act as their official commander, reporting directly to her. Grey Worm is selected, though it is not established how. Upon reporting his election to Daenerys, she finds his name and its associated practice\u2013 given to him by the Good Masters to remind him that he is vermin\u2013 distasteful, and tells him that he and all Unsullied may use their original names or chose new ones they like. Grey Worm agrees to disseminate the instructions to the other Unsullied, but chooses to keep his. He considers that his birth name was cursed as he had it when was taken as a slave, while \"Grey Worm\" is a lucky name as it was the one he had when Daenerys Stormborn set him free.\n\nAfter Daenerys and her army set camp a short distance from Yunkai, Daenerys has Grey Worm send a man to the Yunkish gates to deliver a message to the Wise Masters: she will receive them in her camp to accept their surrender.\n\nGrey Worm is present when Daenerys hosts the captains of the Second Sons, Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn, and their lieutenant Daario Naharis. Grey Worm is highly offended by Mero's boorish and insulting behavior towards Daenerys and Missandei, and offers - in Low Valyrian - to remove Mero's tongue as punishment, reaching for the bronze dagger in his belt. Daenerys graciously has him stand down.\n\nGrey Worm is present when Jorah Mormont and Daario plan the infiltration of Yunkai. Grey Worm remains silent throughout most of the meeting, until Daenerys asks for his opinion of Daario. Grey Worm is not used to having his own opinions, but Daenerys gently encourages him by saying that he is a leader now, and he responds that he trusts him. Daenerys sends the three to sneak into the city. Grey Worm proves himself an artist with his spear, easily besting dozens of Yunkish guards. He returns to his queen battered but uninjured at the end of the night.\n\nSer Barristan and Missandei reveal that Grey Worm and Daario have been indulging in a bit of gambling: they have been at the contest since midnight and have missed a morning meeting with the queen as a result. Daenerys is very irritated to discover that their contest is a game of who can balance their sword for the longest, the prize being the honor of riding at her side when the march resumes. Daenerys assigns the pair to guard the livestock as punishment for their childish game. When they fail to move, she casually warns them that the \"winner\" of the contest must find a new queen, prompting them to drop their weapons instantly. Grey Worm's gaze lingers on Missandei, which Daario takes as a sign that he is interested in her, and points out that this problematic given Grey Worm's eunuch status. Grey Worm tells Daario that he is not a smart man for saying such things.\n\nAt the gates of Meereen, Grey Worm asks to be allowed to kill the city's champion for Daenerys. The queen declines as she is unwilling to risk her army's official commander.\n\nMissandei is revealed to have been teaching Grey Worm the Common Tongue. As the lessons progress, Missandei and Grey Worm discuss their lost homelands (Naath and the Summer Isles respectively) and Grey Worm's eagerness to kill the Masters of Slaver's Bay. Daenerys interrupts them to dispatch Grey Worm on a mission of subterfuge: he is to sneak into Meereen and arm the slaves there.\n\nGrey Worm and his team successfully slip in through the sewers and convince the slaves to rise up, ensuring the city is taken from within.\n\nWhile swimming, Grey Worm notices Missandei bathing naked with other women down the stream, and gazes at her intently. She notices this, and stands up slowly to let him view her before finally covering herself. Later he apologizes if he made her uncomfortable, and Missandei assures him he did not. It is made apparent that some sexual desire may still reside in him, even with his castration, and Missandei is not averse to his interest, later speculating with Daenerys as to \"how much\" the masters took from him. Grey Worm is later present when Jorah Mormont is banished from Daenerys's service.\n\nGrey Worm is on hand when Daenerys learns that Drogon has killed a three year old girl. He later reports that Drogon is not actually in Meereen.\n\nGrey Worm reports to Daenerys when an Unsullied soldier named White Rat is murdered while visiting a brothel. Later, he is approached by Missandei, who asks him why an Unsullied would want to visit a brothel. Grey Worm states that he does not know and leaves.\n\nGrey Worm, with the help of Daario Naharis, successfully track down and arrest a Son of the Harpy involved in White Rat's murder. Daario teaches Grey Worm that his Second Sons are less conspicuous than the Unsullied, making them much better at tracking down elusive Sons of the Harpy.\n\nAfter, Grey Worm is at Daenerys's council when they discuss what should be done with the Son of the Harpy who has been arrested. Later, he is present when Mossador is publicly executed for murdering the prisoner before a fair trial could take place. Grey Worm leads the Unsullied who escort Daenerys and her retainers away when a riot breaks out.\n\nGrey Worm is patrolling the streets of Meereen with other Unsullied when they discover that the Sons of the Harpy have murdered several individuals in broad daylight. The same prostitute that lured White Rat to his death directs Grey Worm and his Unsullied into a trap, where they are surrounded by Sons of the Harpy in a narrow passageway. The Unsullied are overwhelmed by their sheer numbers and are brutally murdered.\n\nGrey Worm, despite taking numerous wounds, kills many of his attackers until he is the last Unsullied left alive. Just as the Sons of the Harpy close in around him, Ser Barristan Selmy arrives and manages to draw most of them away from Grey Worm.\n\nBarristan fights valiantly and kills most of the Sons, but ultimately suffers several mortal wounds. Before the last Son of the Harpy can cut Barristan's throat, Grey Worm manages to kill him before collapsing from his wounds next to the dead knight.\n\nGrey Worm ultimately survives his injuries, but is incapacitated and confined to a bed. He is accosted by Missandei, and admits to her his shame for letting Barristan Selmy die and failing Daenerys, and for feeling fear when he believed he was going to die, not for his life, but because of the possibility of never seeing her again. Missandei, touched by Grey Worm's words, kisses him.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack by the Sons of the Harpy at Daznak's Pit and Daenerys' disappearance on Drogon, Missandei brings Grey Worm \u2013 still recovering from his injuries \u2013 to a meeting of Daenerys's advisors, which now includes Tyrion Lannister.\n\nThey decide that Jorah (who had returned to the city with Tyrion) and Daario would find Daenerys and Tyrion would rule in Meereen in her stead. Grey Worm volunteers to help Jorah and Daario look for Daenerys, but they tell him to remain in the city with Missandei, as he is the only one who can lead the Unsullied in keeping the peace and enforcing Tyrion's rule over Meereen.\n\nGrey Worm and Missandei tell Tyrion and his friend Varys that Daenerys' dragons Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating since she left Meereen. Tyrion decides to free the two dragons from their chains and manages to do so by entertaining them. While Varys deals with the prostitute Vala who has been working with the Sons of Harpy, Grey Worm and Missandei wait with Tyrion. They do not share Tyrion's interest in games with Grey Worm. Before Tyrion can entertain them with a drinking game, Varys returns and reveals that the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai, and the Free City of Volantis have been secretly aiding the Sons of Harpy. While Grey Worm advocates attacking the cities, Missandei advises against it because it would leave Meereen undefended. Tyrion then proposes that Varys use his network of Little birds to open contact with the leaders of these cities.\n\nGrey Worm is later present when Tyrion negotiates with representatives of the three cities and is angered upon hearing Tyrion's proposal that they be allowed to continue slavery for the next seven years and be given compensation for the lost revenue. When a delegation of freedmen confront Tyrion, they demand Grey Worm and Missandei's opinions. Both back Tyrion up publicly, but in private, berate him, Grey Worm warns Tyrion that the Masters will never let them live in peace, as they see him as a mere weapon and Missandei as another whore.\n\nGrey Worm and Missandei are present when Tyrion and Varys hold an audience with Kinvara, the High Priestess of the Red Temple at Volantis. To convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys' blessing, Tyrion forges an alliance with the Red Priestesses to preach to the masses that Dany is The Prince That Was Promised. Later, Tyrion convinces a reluctant Grey Worm and Missandei to drink wine to celebrate Meereen's resurgence and to honor Dany. Grey Worm listens to Tyrion's joke but is unable to come up with his own. However, he is able to comment on Missandei's amateurish attempt of a joke about two translators. As the others laugh in confusion, he reveals he was making up his own joke.\n\nTheir bantering is interrupted by the sound of bombardment. Looking out of the ramparts, Grey Worm and the others see a large fleet pummelling Meereen with trebuchets. They quickly realize that Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis have broken their peace treaty. By nightfall, Tyrion admits that his diplomacy has failed and allows Grey a Worm to take charge of the city's defenses. Outnumbered, Grey Worm proposes holding the pyramid instead of fighting the beaches. Shortly later, they hear movement on the roof and discover that Daeneys has returned on her dragon Drogon.\n\nGrey Worm and the Unsullied are present when Daenerys and Tyrion meet with three representatives from Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis at the Great Pyramid to parley. Belicho Paenymion, Razdal mo Eraz, and Yezzan zo Qaggaz offer to let Dany and Tyrion leave if they return Grey Worm, the rest of the Unsullied, and Missandei to their proper owners to be sold to the highest bidder. Daeneryrs rejects their terms and demands that they surrender. When they refuse, she unleashes her three dragons on the slavers' fleet; wiping their ships out.\n\nIn Dany's absence, Tyrion issues an ultimatum that one of the three masters must die for breaking his pact. Belicho and Razdal try to save their own skins by offering Yezzan, saying he is a commoner and does not speak for them. However, Grey Worm instead slashes the throats of Belicho and Razdal. Tyrion spares the life of Yezzan so that he can send a message to the slavers' cities not to mess with Dany.\n\nSome time later, when Daenerys's massive Targaryen armada at last begins the voyage to Westeros, Grey Worm is seen commanding a ship of Unsullied and Dothraki, ready to take back the Seven Kingdoms for his queen.\n\nGrey Worm arrives on Dragonstone, accompanied by Daenerys, Missandei, Tyrion and Varys. He follows Daenerys from the shore of the island to the hall of the castle. He is about to enter the Chamber of the Painted Table, but is stopped by Missandei.\n\nGrey Worm is present at Daenerys's council with her most important allies when Tyrion Lannister announces that the Unsullied will lead an attack on Casterly Rock to seize it, that being Daenerys's first move in the upcoming war. Later, Missandei comes to his chambers to bid him farewell, which indicates that he will lead the attack. There they engage in a conversation in which he tells her that he is the bravest of the Unsullied, yet he still has one weakness - her. He mentions how all the Unsullied faced their weaknesses to beat them (for an example; those who feared drowning were thrown into the sea). Then Missandei removes her clothes. When she starts to remove his, too, he hesitates before letting her see his castration wounds, after which they start making love by him orally pleasuring her.\n\nGrey Worm later leads the Unsullied in their attack on Casterly Rock, using a secret passage built by Tyrion to enter the seemingly impregnable castle. Realizing too late that capturing the Rock was too easy, he is shocked to see Euron Greyjoy's fleet obliterating his abandoned ships, leaving the Unsullied without any chance of escape by sea.\n\nMissandei wonders what has become of Grey Worm, as they have had no word from the Rock, but Daenerys reassures her that they will. Missandei then reveals her sexual relationship with Grey Worm to her queen.\n\nUpon exiting the dragonglass cave, Daenerys is informed of Grey Worm's condition at the Rock. Because of this, she begins to plot the Battle of the Goldroad.\n\nHaving led the Unsullied to King's Landing over land, Grey Worm stands amongst Daenerys's Unsullied army as they besiege the city to ensure a peaceful parley between Daenerys and Cersei Lannister. After the parley, he accompanies Daenerys and the rest of her group back to Dragonstone.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Grey_Worm"}}

He is well known for his fighting skills, passionate temper, and sexual appetites.","Despite his wayward ways and liberal attitude towards sexuality, Oberyn was very devoted to his family, telling his lover Ellaria that any other person would always have to wait behind her for his affection. He was very close with his sister, Elia, and took her death very hard. As a result, he had a strong and fierce hatred for House Lannister, especially towards Tywin Lannister, whom he believed ordered his sister's murder. He also developed a resentment toward his deceased brother-in-law Rhaegar Targaryen for (from Oberyn's perspective) being unfaithful to Elia and \"stealing away another woman\", which in turn led to a war that cost all of them their lives.","Oberyn enters the trial wearing simple light armor and wielding a light spear with a heavy blade. Upon seeing his opponent, Ellaria grows concerned for his chances at besting the mountainous beast, but Oberyn remains confident. Tyrion is additionally worried by Oberyn's lack of a helmet and his light armor, and witnessing Oberyn drinking before the match does nothing to assuage his fears, but Oberyn claims that he drinks before every battle and that armor hinders his preferred fighting style. Before he faces Clegane, he promises Ellaria that he will survive.\"  As the battle commences, the Red Viper manages to impress the crowd with a dazzling display of spear twirling before engaging Clegane, whom he taunts. Clegane ignores his words and launches a furious attack. Although the latter wears heavier armor and wields a massive broadsword, Oberyn is able to swiftly duck and avoid his swings, poking and prodding at him with his spear, demanding him to admit to the rape and murder of Elia Martell and her children, vengefully chanting in an ever-louder voice: \"You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!\". Clegane knocks Oberyn off his feet twice and manages to cut his spear in half, but fails to wound him; Oberyn simply evades his swings again and walks over to his squire, who tosses him a replacement spear. Meanwhile, he wears Clegane down, knocking off his helmet and inflicting minor wounds through gaps in the huge knights' armor.","Oberyn's body is returned to Dorne, where Doran intends to bury and mourn for him. Despite his grief and anger at losing another sibling (his last one in fact) at the hands of the Mountain, Doran recognizes that Oberyn died fighting voluntarily in a trial by combat, which by law is not considered murder. However, Oberyn's popularity among the people of Dorne lead many to demand war against the Lannisters as retribution for his death. Most vocal in support of war are Oberyn's paramour Ellaria and his daughters, the Sand Snakes. However, Doran refuses to inflict war on his people, especially a war he doesn't believe Dorne can win.","As a result of Doran's decisions, Ellaria and the Sand Snakes murder both Doran and his son and heir, Trystane, and seize power in Dorne, even though they were Oberyn's own brother and nephew, respectively.","Cersei enrages Ellaria with Oberyn's carelessness, explaining that fact that it caused his death, and his killer, Ser Gregor, is stronger than ever. Despite the murder of Myrcella Baratheon, by Ellaria, was set up to avenge Oberyn, this is later proved to be one of her worst decisions, as Tyene is slowly poisoned with the long farewell, by Cersei, to avenge Myrcella.","Although Oberyn is known to have studied to become a maester in his youth - successfully forging several links of his chain - he is noted to have studied the poisoner's art while travelling the Free Cities, not at the Citadel, as the show specifies. When Oberyn visits Tyrion Lannister in his cell following Joffrey's murder, he jokes that he owes Cersei his gratitude for accusing her brother of the deed. Had she not, Oberyn himself may soon have come under suspicion, because \"who knows more of poison than the Red Viper of Dorne, after all?\u201D"],"name":"Oberyn Martell","description":"Oberyn Martell was a forceful, lusty man with a quick wit and barbed tongue. He was renowned for his duels, his temper, his keen intellect, and his carnality, all of which made him extremely popular in Dorne. Oberyn traveled the world in his youth, and even fought in a mercenary company in Essos - his skill with a spear was enough to face off evenly against the feared Gregor Clegane in a duel. He had a very close relationship with his sister Elia and they were inseparable as children. Oberyn was also close to his older brother Doran, although their temperaments were very different. While Doran had been raised to be the heir to the Dornish throne, Oberyn was able to indulge in the wayward ways common among the Dornishmen.\n\nOberyn was also a very intelligent man: he studied at the Citadel for several years before deciding he was simply bored with a future as a maester and left. During that time he studied poisons extensively, with which he frequently coated his weapons. He was also able to recognize that substantially heavy armor would hinder his proficiency in combat, since he preferred unpredictability and agility over strength.\n\nAbove all Oberyn was a deeply passionate man, with a hot temper that often led him into duels and grudges; but in equal measure this also made him deeply loyal to those he cared about, such as his siblings, his paramour Ellaria, and his daughters. Although he was a very serious man, he had a very laid-back, easygoing attitude, taking anything that came his way in his stride, but he wasn't incapable of being deadly serious when the situation insisted upon it.\n\nOberyn's overall attitude was that life is short, and one must enjoy all of life's pleasures while one can - thus his sexual adventures had become infamous, and popular rumor has it that he must have had sex with half of the people he had ever met on both sides of the Narrow Sea. He was also bisexual and did not limit his pleasure to one gender alone, thus he engaged in sex with both men and women. Despite his promiscuity, he genuinely loved his paramour, Ellaria, who is equally as wild as Oberyn was. Oberyn was a deeply honorable man, but his philosophy in life was that he did not care about the negative opinions of others - he would rather live life on his own terms, openly challenging his enemies and risk destruction rather than live by someone else's rules.\n\nRather ironically, it was Oberyn's zest for life, his temper, overconfidence, love for his sister, and hatred towards Gregor Clegane that led to his death. He entered his duel with Gregor with an arrogant swagger, making already several impetuous and unwise decisions such as drinking before the duel and refusing to wear a helmet. Moreover, he was clearly enjoying himself while fighting Gregor, even though he was aware of the seriousness of the situation and one false move could result in both his and an innocent man's death. Given the skills he displayed while fighting The Mountain, however, perhaps these traits were not unjustified. Unfortunately, near the end of their fight, where it seemed certain Oberyn would win, Oberyn allowed his emotions to get the better of him, angrily demanding a confession to killing his sister. Gregor used this as an advantage, and brutally killed Oberyn, but not before sadistically admitting to murdering Elia and her children and raping her.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oberyn_Martell"}}

Judging by his simple armor of copper disks, he may have once been a Thenn. However, Thenns are always shaved bald, but this wight has wispy grey hair.\n\nThe wight is among a group being led by a White Walker when they are ambushed by a group consisting of Jon Snow, Tormund, Jorah Mormont, Sandor Clegane, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros, Gendry and several wildlings. Once Jon kills the White Walker with Longclaw, the other wights drop dead, leaving this one alone. It tries to escape, but is knocked to the ground by a punch from Tormund. Sandor throws himself on top of it, and it lets out a loud shriek. Sandor attempts to silence it by covering its mouth with his hand, causing its skin to peel off. Though Sandor does manage to silence it, its shrieks have caught the attention of the rest of the army of the dead. As the army closes in, the group put a sack over the wight's head and tie it up with ropes, and flee with Sandor carrying the wight over his shoulder. They are cornered when the surrounding army forces them onto a rock in the middle of a frozen lake, but cannot attack as the ice is fragile. As both sides wait, the captured wight constantly tries to escape from its bounds. Sandor eventually gets annoyed and kicks it, causing it to cry out and the other wights to respond. When the wights eventually attack once the ice has been hardened by the presence of the Night King and the other White Walkers, several of them try to rescue the captive wight, but are destroyed by its abductors. Daenerys Targaryen arrives towards the end of the battle with her dragons Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal, and the captured wight is taken away on Drogon, with Sandor securing it by impaling it on one of the dragon's spines. Upon arriving at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Sandor carries the bound wight to a rowboat to take aboard a Targaryen ship for the journey to King's Landing.\n\nThe wight is brought to King's Landing, where it is presented to Queen Cersei Lannister during the parley at the Dragonpit as proof for the existence of the Army of the Dead. When it is freed from the crate it had been transported in, the wight sprints towards Cersei but is stopped by a chain yanked back by Sandor Clegane. Clegane cuts the wight in half, thus showing to the assembled onlookers that wights can survive severe wounds. Jon then proves to Cersei and those loyal to her that the only way of destroying wights is by burning them or cutting them with dragonglass - finally destroying the wight with the latter. Upon seeing the wight, Euron Greyjoy uses the pretext to openly announce that he will flee back to Pyke to wait out the invasion of the dead. However, secretly, he plotted with Cersei Lannister. Cersei also openly announces that she will send her army north to fend off the army of the dead but, in truth, has no such plans at all.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Captured_wight"}}

Meraxes was said to be capable of swallowing an entire horse.

Both Balerion and Drogon have had black as their primary color, with red as a secondary color along their horns, spinal plates, and wing membranes. Meraxes is also noted as having golden eyes. Drogon is described as having red eyes as well - which might imply that a dragon's secondary color on its horns also matches its eye color, which if true would indicate that Meraxes had gold as its secondary color. This is not necessarily true, however, as some dragons were noted as being one solid color throughout, with no secondary colors.\n\nFour years after Aegon I was crowned, the Targaryens had consolidated their position over the other kingdoms enough to launch another determined invasion of Dorne, known as the First Dornish War. Once again, the Dornishmen resorted to guerilla tactics instead of open battle, harassing the Targaryen armies then retreating - and massacring the large land army they attempted to lead through the Red Mountains.\n\nRhaenys and Meraxes were both killed during the war in 10AL. At Hellholt, in the middle of Dorne's central desert, Meraxes died when a lucky shot with a scorpion-bolt pierced her eye and drove into her brain, instantly killing her in mid-air. Rhaenys presumably died when the dragon plummeted hundreds of feet to the ground - though unsubstantiated rumors (or myths) allege that Rhaenys survived the fall, badly injured, but the Dornish slowly tortured and mutilated her to death in revenge. At the end of the war in 13 AL, the Dornish returned Meraxes's skull to King's Landing as a peace offering.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin only figured out the details of Meraxes's death some time after he wrote the first novel, which introduces a conundrum: when Tyrion saw the three largest dragon skulls kept under the Red Keep, he thought the smallest one belonged to Vhagar, who was indeed the smallest at the time of the War of Conquest. The revelation that Vhagar outlived Meraxes complicates this, however, and indeed the The Princess and the Queen novella states that when Vhagar died 130 years after the War of Conquest, she had grown almost as large as Balerion. The simple answer is probably that as with all POV narrations, Tyrion's POV is not objectively true, and he simply assumed that the smallest skull belonged to Vhagar - even though logically, it should have belonged to Meraxes.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Meraxes"}}

He is fluent in the Common Tongue of Westeros.\n\nUnlike Kraznys mo Nakloz of Astapor, Razdal is not a braggart, but shrewd and politically savvy. A reserved, calculating man, he is capable of being polite when it is politically expedient. While he is still capable of making threats, they are subdued, part of calculated negotiation tactics instead of emotional outbursts.\n\nLike many of the Wise Masters, he prides himself on Yunkai's descent from the old Ghiscari Empire, which was already old and mighty when the Valyrian Freehold was young.\n\nRazdal mo Eraz is sent by the Wise Masters to negotiate with Daenerys Targaryen when she sets camp outside of Yunkai and sends word demanding the surrender of the city. He arrives atop a palanquin carried by several slaves. After being announced, he comes too close to Daenerys but is intimidated away by her dragons. Razdal offers Daenerys gifts of gold and ships for her to travel back to Westeros, so that Yunkai will be left in peace. Daenerys offers Razdal his own life if he goes back to the Wise Masters and ensures that all slaves are released and given payment for their years of service or else she will lay waste to Yunkai.\n\nDumbfounded at her boldness, Razdal stands defiant and retorts that Yunkai has powerful allies and that after the coming battle the Yunkai'i will enslave the survivors, even Daenerys herself, prompting Drogon to furiously hiss at him. He reminds Daenerys that he was offered safety but she retorts that her dragons react poorly to their \"Mother\" being threatened. Razdal orders his slaves to take back the gold, but the enraged Drogon stands in their way. Daenerys then sends him away and keeps the gold, as Razdal returns to his palanquin, muttering curses.\n\nRazdal represents the Wise Masters of Yunkai and alongside Belicho Paenymion of Volantis, and Yezzan zo Qaggaz of Astapor. They attend a meeting with Tyrion Lannister, who is working to cut those cities' support to the Sons of the Harpy. When Tyrion attempts to reassure the envoys that Daenerys is not long for Slaver's Bay, Razdal reminds the assembled that the last time he offered Daenerys a chance to return to Westeros, she rejected the deal. Razdal seems intrigued by Tyrion's proposal to end slavery in Astapor and Yunkai gradually with reparations, but seems somewhat unimpressed by the whores that Tyrion offers the envoys at the end of the meeting.Later, the Masters break their pact with Meereen and assault the city with a large fleet. After bombarding the city with flaming trebuchets, the three emissaries meet Daenerys and her entourage to demand her surrender. They tell Dany that they will let her and Tyrion leave the city if they hand over the Unsullied and Missandei to be resold into slavery, and her dragons to be slaughtered. Daenerys clarifies that the meeting was her offering them a chance to surrender.\n\nA moment later, Drogon flies up and intimidates the emissaries, with Dany taking flight on his back shortly thereafter. She rides Drogon into the bay as Rhaegal and Viserion emerge from a pyramid to join them and they begin to burn an attacking ship. It is obvious to Razdal that he has made a grave mistake. The Masters' soldiers abandon them, and Missandei announces that one of the three masters must die, as punishment for their disobedience.\n\nYezzan, the lowest of the three, is immediately scapegoated by the other two for not being highborn.

In spite of this distinction, hedge knights are generally considered to be only one tiny step above smallfolk. Members of the Night's Watch, the Order of Maesters, or the clergy of the Faith of the Seven are not usually considered smallfolk, although some members of those orders may have originated from the ranks of the common people."],"name":"Smallfolk","description":"The exiled Viserys Targaryen was convinced that the smallfolk of Westeros were chafing under the usurper Robert Baratheon's rule, and secretly hoping for the return of their true king Viserys. Ser Jorah Mormont explains to Daenerys Targaryen that this is mere fantasy - particularly given that Robert's rule has been reasonably stable for the past seventeen years. Ultimately, Jorah says, the smallfolk care nothing about the political games being played by the high lords, so long as they don't directly affect them.\n\nWhen Cersei Lannister asks Robert why he is so worried about the prospect of a Targaryen-aligned Dothraki army, he explains that should the Dothraki cross the Narrow Sea, the nobles can retreat to their castles, but then a great many of the smallfolk would be slaughtered and those that are left will turn on their absentee king and possibly decide to join Viserys.\n\nWhen Tyrion Lannister arrives in King's Landing as acting Hand of the King, he warns Cersei that the city is overburdened with refugees, and due to the war half of the city will be starving when winter comes. In this volatile environment, he criticizes the purge of King Robert's bastard children, saying it has made her appear brutal and given the commoners a rallying cry against her. Cersei bluntly states that she does not care what \"the people\" think.Janos Slynt also tried to warn Cersei about the influx of starving refugees and strain on the city's resources, but she brushed off his concerns by telling him to simply bar the city's gates against the masses of refugees trying to seek shelter inside. As conditions worsen, when the royal party moves through the city after sending Princess Myrcella off to Dorne, a starving mob pelts King Joffrey Baratheon with insults and demands for bread, and ultimately, pelts him with cow dung. Joffrey stupidly shouts for his heavily outnumbered guards to kill them all, sparking off major food riots in which the royal party narrowly avoids being lynched by the mob. The fat and corrupt High Septon is torn limb from limb by the mob.\n\nWhen King's Landing is later under siege by Stannis Baratheon, Cersei drunkenly explains to Sansa Stark that her conception of ruling is that \"the only way to keep the smallfolk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy\".\n\nBy contrast, when members of House Tyrell arrive in King's Landing after they enter into an alliance with the Lannisters, they show more concern about helping the starving poor of the capital city. Margaery Tyrell and her attendants give out bread and toys to an orphanage, to Joffrey's confusion. She chides Cersei that the poor are no different from the highborn if given a chance. Cersei later attempts to warn Joffrey about the Tyrells, accurately surmising that Margaery is making a great show of charity to the city's poor in order to build up support for herself, taking it away from the Lannisters in the process.\n\nTyrion later speaks with Margaery's grandmother Olenna Tyrell, who insists that an expensive royal wedding will be a good distraction for the common people. Olenna tacitly acknowledges to Tyrion that the Tyrells have a more pragmatic concern behind such charity towards the smallfolk. Unlike Cersei, Olenna and the Tyrells are aware of the difficulties of ruling a population of angry and starving people. While it is self-serving of the Tyrells, it could also be said to be basic good governance, and the smallfolk are getting real benefits from it. While Cersei and Joffrey earned the scorn of the smallfolk for mistreating them, Margaery Tyrell quickly becomes beloved by the smallfolk for easing their suffering. At Joffrey and Margaery's wedding feast, Margaery announces that all the leftover food will be donated to the poor; Cersei secretly countermands the decision.\n\nHowever, when Margaery is later arrested by the Faith Militant for perjury on her brother Loras's behalf, Olenna visits the High Sparrow and threatens to renege on Tyrell support to the capital in order to secure her grandchildren's release. Yet the High Sparrow remains steadfast in his position, remarking that the nobility of Westeros have forgotten they are outnumbered by the smallfolk and tells Olenna to ponder what happens when the many stop fearing the few.\n\nEven though it was Cersei who named the High Sparrow as the new High Septon and informed against the Tyrell siblings to him in the first place, he later has her arrested as well on charges of fornication, treason, incest, and regicide. When Qyburn urges her to confess so that she can be reunited with her son King Tommen, she initially refuses, displaying the same level of contempt that she has always had toward the smallfolk.\n\nEventually, however, Cersei winds up facing the wrath of the smallfolk when she is forced to perform a walk of atonement. As the once prideful Queen Mother walks completely naked from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep, the smallfolk proceed to hurl filth and vicious insults at her, which eventually reduces her to tears \u2013 although in the long run, the experience does not humble her.\n\nMeanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Tyrion Lannister meets with Daenerys Targaryen, the last surviving member of House Targaryen. He asks who she thinks will support her claim to the Iron Throne in the event that she returns to Westeros. When she idealistically declares the smallfolk, Tyrion reminds her that she relied solely on the smallfolk in Meereen and that the city has since fallen into chaos.\n\nWith the Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor the smallfolk will probably hate Cersei even more.\n\nSmallfolk make up the common working and middle classes of Westeros, serving as farmers, laborers, builders, shopkeepers, servants, and soldiers. They are ruled over by their lords, but are not slaves, slavery being abolished in Westeros thousands of years ago at the command of the Faith of the Seven.\n\nBecause of their lack of authority and power, smallfolk tend to be neglected by their lords, seen only as a suppliers of food or soldiers. Smallfolk tend to look up to knights and religious folk who stand up for their interests.\n\nA major theme emphasized in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels is that it doesn't really matter to the smallfolk who wins the \"game of thrones\", the political machinations in Westeros, because either way the outbreak of war is making them suffer. Particularly as seen in \"Fire and Blood\", once Joffrey comes to power he shows absolutely no concern for his subjects, frequently having smallfolk killed for slight or imagined insults, if not simply killing them on a whim. The Riot of King's Landing in Season 2 was considerably more macabre in the books: as the crowds shouted for bread, a woman stepped into the middle of the road to block the path of the royal party, holding her own dead baby - which had died of malnutrition due to the war that Cersei and Joffrey started. She then drops it at her feet to point at Cersei, blaming her for instigating the war.\n\nEven the death of Robb Stark and the end of the Northern rebellion after the Red Wedding is a hollow achievement for the thousands of displaced refugees in the Riverlands, where most of the war played out. While major battles like Whispering Wood or Oxcross are memorable, much of medieval warfare typically involved striking where the enemy was weakest. Thus the day-to-day fighting of the War of the Five Kings usually consisted of Lannister raiding parties riding ahead to burn out Riverlands farms and villages that the Starks controlled, then fleeing before the Starks could respond in force. The Starks and Tullys then made retaliatory raids on farms and villages in territory the Lannisters controlled. As a result, by the time Robb Stark dies, most of the Riverlands are completely burned out - destroying one of the main breadbasket regions of the Seven Kingdoms, even as winter fast approaches. After the Red Wedding, Tyrion scoffs that the Riverlands are \"a devastation\" in the aftermath of the war, with starvation in the thousands.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Smallfolk"}}

Winterfell is later seized by Theon Greyjoy but Bran and Rickon escape along with Osha, Hodor, Summer, and Shaggydog. They pass close by to the shepherd's farm. Theon tracks them there and brutally questions the shepherd who denies having seen them but Dagmer finds some walnut shells, which confirms their suspicions that they were there. Theon later returns to Winterfell with the charred corpses of two boys, claiming them to be the Stark princes and prompting Maester Luwin to wail in horror.\n\nA few days later, however, Luwin spots Osha sneaking into the catacombs. Having accompanied Theon and his fellow ironborn occupiers up to the point when they reached the shepherd's farm, Luwin quickly deduces that the corpses, which are still kept on display, must in fact be Jack and Billy. When he meets with Osha later on in the catacombs, he urges her not to tell Bran and Rickon and she readily agrees, but Bran overhears them anyway.\n\nFollowing the Sack of Winterfell, Theon is held prisoner at the Dreadfort and brutally tortured by a group of men led by Ramsay Snow, who initially presents himself to his prisoner as an ironborn emissary sent by his sister. As Ramsay fumbles around with keys at a locked gate under the pretense of helping Theon escape, Theon confesses to his \"savior\" of having Dagmer kill two orphans and passing them off as Bran and Rickon.\n\nTheon, who is mockingly renamed \"Reek\" by his captor, is forced to confess this yet again to Ramsay's father Roose Bolton upon his return to the Dreadfort after murdering Robb Stark and being named Lord Paramount of the North.\n\nWhen Sansa Stark returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay at the behest of Petyr Baelish, Ramsay initially forces Theon to keep up the charade and apologize to Sansa for murdering her brothers. Eventually, however, an irate Sansa forces Theon to finally confess to her as well that the corpses he presented at Winterfell were not in fact Bran and Rickon; they were \"two farm boys.\"\n\nAfter escaping Ramsay, Theon decides to part ways with Sansa as she travels north to be reunited with Jon Snow at Castle Black, entrusting her safety to Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne. Though Sansa offers to vouch for him, Theon cites his murder of Jack and Billy as one of the many reasons why he fears Jon will still most likely have him executed.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jack"}}

Under his tenure as High Septon, the Faith Militant was reestablished, and the Faith amasses considerable influence over the Iron Throne during the reign of King Tommen I. His real name is unknown. The High Sparrow was immensely serious, threatening, and only occasionally tender.","He emerged as more or less the leader of the religious protest movement known as \"the Sparrows\", and his critics started mockingly calling him the \"High Sparrow\" - in sarcastic comparison to the High Septon, the highest cleric and ordained leader of the Faith of the Seven. His followers, however, adopted the nickname in pride, and themselves started calling him \"the High Sparrow\" as a sign of respect. He never tried to call himself this, but the name stuck. After being made High Septon, as per tradition it became forbidden to ever refer to him by his given name again, so whatever his original name was remains unknown.","The High Sparrow later presides over the inquest into the charges of sodomy, and blasphemy against Loras Tyrell. He also questions Margaery Tyrell and Olyvar on the charges. Olyvar's testimony convinces the High Septon to bring Loras to a full trial, and also to arrest Margaery for perjury and blasphemy, as she swore before the gods that her (false) testimony was true.","Later, the High Sparrow has an audience with King Tommen, who petitions for his mother Cersei to be granted permission to visit her dead daughter, Myrcella. The Sparrow declines the King's request on the grounds that Cersei has not been cleared of her crimes; namely the murder of King Robert I Baratheon and incest. When Tommen criticizes the Sparrow's legalistic treatment of his mother, he professes admiration for the deep love between mother and son, which he attributes to the Mother. However, he assures Tommen that he has no vendetta against his mother but is merely carrying out the will of the Seven. Before Tommen leaves, he tells the King to pray to the Seven and that the gods have worked through his grandfather and mother even though they may not acknowledge it.","The sparrows are also angered that the leadership of the Faith of the Seven has become corrupt and easily bribed off by the Lannisters, rather than speak out against their war and the suffering it has caused. The High Septon when the war began was richly dressed and too obese to walk far, even as war refugees starved to death in the streets of King's Landing (this High Septon was later torn to pieces by a mob in food riots). The ruling council of the Faith of the Seven, known as the Most Devout, have also amassed great personal wealth in their offices - which they usually display by wearing expensive silks and jewelry. In stark contrast, the High Sparrow is a poor priest who used to travel the countryside performing his services, such as naming newborn children, absolving sins and performing marriages, at humble villages too small to have their own septs. Therefore, he wears only a simple roughspun tunic of white wool, as a sign of his humility and piety."],"name":"High Sparrow","description":"The High Sparrow presents himself as humble, pious and wise. He is unmoved by life's luxuries and abjures materialism. While some other septons are indifferent toward the small-folk and their problems, the High Sparrow consistently shows concern and compassion.\n\nHowever, behind a harmless facade, he is ruthless and fanatical in his beliefs as well as a shrewd and highly intelligent political player and Machiavellian with a keen and personal understanding of the narcissistic mindsets of many of the political players of Kings Landing. He manipulates Cersei's resentment toward Margaery to gain control of King's Landing through the Faith Militant. Later, he gains influence over the naive and weak-willed King Tommen Baratheon, obtaining even more power through deliberate manipulation and exploitation of the young king. He also psychologically tortured Cersei, Loras, and Margaery to obtain a confession on their \"sins\".\n\nIt's unclear if he really believes in his piety or if his humility is only a facade to obtain power. He has shown to display a smug smile when he knows he has the upper hand in a conflict, and he displays a rather arrogant certainty in his interpretation of the will of the Gods. Even if this is so, whether he does it for a genuine greater good strengthened by faith or for his own political agenda and hubris - perhaps a combination thereof, as is often the case with those of similar ambitions - is unclear. Despite this, he appears to be unafraid of death, remaining calm when Jaime threatens to cut him down, though this could just be because he gauged, quite correctly, that Jaime would not kill him if it were to mean his own death afterwards although he did seem shocked when he discovered that Cersei had laced the Great Sept of Baelor with wildfire just before his death.\n\nHowever, despite his brilliant manipulations and his army of followers, the High Sparrow's blind devotion ultimately led to his death. As Cersei put it; because he had no use for anything in the material world, he was unafraid of any threat the material world could produce. Somewhat similar to Daario Naharis's taunt against Grey Worm, a lack of fear limits a person's understanding as to how scared people think, thus making it difficult for them to manipulate those people. The High Sparrow was over-confident that Cersei was powerless against himself and his followers. Therefore, he was unable to comprehend how extreme her actions would become in order to eliminate them (i.e. blowing up the Sept of Baelor with wildfire and killing dozens - if not hundreds - of innocent people in the process).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/High_Sparrow"}}

However, Cheese just told Maelor that his mother wanted him dead, and some believe that Helaena named Maelor because Jaehaerys was heir to the Iron Throne, or because Maelor was just too young to understand.

He grew up on the farm and had a relationship with a neighboring farmer's daughter in his youth.\n\nGrenn is a recruit in the Night's Watch training at Castle Black. Grenn, Rast, and Pypar are directed by the Master-at-Arms Ser Alliser Thorne to test Jon Snow's skills in combat. Jon breaks Grenn's nose in the fight.\n\nAnnoyed by Jon's superior attitude, the three of them threaten Jon in the armory, but are encouraged to leave him alone by Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion suggests to Jon that he remember their deficiencies in training compared to his own privileged upbringing.

Sam counters that Grenn offered him a ride, and Grenn says that he only did so because he was fed up of Sam's complaints about his blisters. Eddison Tollett watches the bickering pair. Jon dismounts and leads his horse towards the wooden hall known as Craster's Keep. Edd stands beside him and deadpans that he was born in a similar place but that he has now fallen on hard times. Sam joins them and notes the women working around the hall, asking if they are girls. Sam says that he has not seen a girl for six months, and Edd warns the younger men not to speak to them. Grenn wonders if Craster does not like people speaking to his daughters, and Edd says that they are also his wives, explaining that Craster marries his daughters and breeds more daughters with them.

Sam notices Gilly passing with two rabbits and observes that it is greedy for Craster to have so many wives. Edd deadpans that they were having a serious discussion. Grenn points out two other women walking past. Sam says there is nothing like the sight of a woman walking away, and Grenn replies that he prefers watching them come towards him.

Jon and Jeor discuss the Halfhand's reputation as a skilled ranger. Sam says that the scenery is beautiful and that Gilly would love it there. Edd tells Grenn that there is nothing more sickening than a man in love.\n\nHaving reached the fortified summit of the Fist, the rangers prepare their camp. They are digging through the snow and unloading their gear. Ghost has rejoined the party and watches the men work from atop a mound of snow. Sentries dot the edges of the summit. Sam is amazed at being in such an ancient place, telling his companions that it was fortified by the First Men in the Long Winter thousands and thousands of years earlier. He considers all of the major historical events that have happened since in wonder, including the invasion of the Andals and the conquering of Westeros by House Targaryen. Edd implores Sam to stop talking. Sam asks what his companions think the First Men were like. Edd suggests that they were stupid, saying that no clever man finds himself in a place like the Fist. Jon suggests that their distant ancestors were afraid and came to the First to escape something. He says that he does not believe that it worked.\n\nA horn sounds, halting the rangers. Grenn listens intently and wonders if it is a warning about the Wildlings. Jon pauses before saying that a single blast is for rangers, returning while wildlings would have triggered two blasts. Edd notes the horrible moment after one blast on a horn when you must stand and wait, wondering if a second blast will announce foes. Sam adds that three blasts are used to signal White Walkers. Jon turns to look at him, and he explains that it has been a thousand years, but the horn is only blown three times for White Walkers. Grenn asks how Sam knows if so much time has passed. Sam begins to say that he read it in a book, but Edd pre-empts and mimics his answer. Jon says that he can see Qhorin approaching. Edd says that they will live another day, punctuating his monotone with a sarcastic cheer.\n\nQhorin arrives and reports sighting lookouts in the Skirling Pass. He takes a small party of scouts ahead to surprise the lookouts; Jon is among them. They do not return and are feared dead. Grenn discovers a stone tablet while digging latrines. Beneath it is a cache of weapons wrapped in a Night's Watch cloak. Sam identifies them as being made of Dragonglass.\n\nGrenn, Edd, and Sam are gathering animal droppings that will be used to keep fires burning. Grenn complains that he be believed they would be fighting wildlings, and people shouldn't live in a place where they have to burn animal droppings to keep warm. Edd sarcastically states to tell him if they spot a tree anywhere in the vast amounts of snow. While listening to Sam talk about Gilly, the group hears three blasts; the signal for White Walkers. Grenn and Edd run back to the Fist, but accidentally leave Sam behind.\n\nGrenn survives the White Walkers attack on the Fist of the First Men and regroups with the remaining survivors, as the ranging attempts to pull back to the Wall. While marching back to the wall with the others, he notices that Samwell collapses from fatigue. Samwell is upset that Grenn and Edd left him when the White Walkers and the wights came, but they both help him back to his feet.\n\nGrenn arrives with the rest of the survivors at Craster's Keep, where Craster reluctantly allows them to stay. He eats inside with the rest of the survivors and notices Gilly's cries of pain while she is giving birth. Later, Grenn and Edd are shoveling pig-shit while listening to Rast voice his distrust of Craster. Rast firmly states that Craster will hand them all over to the White Walkers, but Grenn and Edd refuse to listen.\n\nGrenn, Edd, Samwell, Rast, and the rest of the survivors stand vigil lead by Lord Commander Mormont over a deceased ranger named Bannen. Grenn states that he did not know a broken foot could kill a man. Later, Grenn is present when the Mutiny at Craster's Keep occurs. He attacks Karl after Rast stabs Lord Commander Mormont in the back.\n\nWhile the brothers of the Night's Watch at Castle Black discuss the wildling threat, a single horn blast is heard. It is revealed to be Grenn and Edd, who have survived the Mutiny at Craster's Keep. Alliser Thorne questions why it took them so long to return. Grenn reveals they were held captive by the black brothers who betrayed Commander Mormont. Grenn also states that Karl is the one who is leading them and they are content with staying at the keep, eating Craster's food, and raping his daughter-wives.\n\nJon Snow spars with Grenn in front of new recruits at Castle Black. Grenn helps in demonstrating the wildling strategy of wielding a weapon in each hand, which Jon learned while he was with the wildlings. Shortly after, Jon is dismissed by Alliser Thorne because only rangers like Grenn should be training new recruits, not stewards. When Jon Snow's expedition to capture or kill all the Mutineers at Craster's Keep is sanctioned by Alliser Thorne, Grenn calls the brothers in the hall to attention and is the first to volunteer to go with Jon.\n\nBefore the raid begins, Locke scouts the keep and believes that taking down the mutineers should be easy. However, Grenn warns them that their leader, Karl, is probably the most dangerous. As the former top-paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom, Grenn has seen what Karl can do with a knife. Grenn fights alongside his fellow black brothers during the raid on Craster's Keep. After all the mutineers are slain, the casualties are taken into account. They initially find that four loyal brothers died fighting the mutineers, but it becomes five when Locke's dead body is found. Grenn wonders what could have killed Locke in such a gruesome manner.\n\nAlong with Jon and Edd, Grenn returns to Castle Black and is greeted by the other brothers of the Night's Watch. He sits in as Jon argues that they should close up the tunnel.\n\nGrenn is furious when he learns that Mole's Town has been attacked and members of the Night's Watch were butchered. Edd argues that all black brothers were under orders to remain at Castle Black. Grenn wants to retaliate, but Jon reminds him that is exactly what the wildlings want. Grenn wonders how it will be possible for the Night's Watch to defend the realm against a foe that outnumbers them 1,000 to 1 if they can't even defend Mole's Town.\n\nGrenn is on top of the Wall when the wildling attack begins. While loading the ramps with barrels filled with oil, Grenn accidentally drops one off the Wall. Alliser Thorne angrily drills his men on properly following orders when another horn blows from down below at Castle Black, signaling the unanticipated appearance of Tormund and Styr's band of wildlings at the castle's southern entrance. \n\nAlliser has to go below as his leadership is needed there, entrusting command of the men guarding the Wall to Janos Slynt. When Grenn notices Slynt's incompetence, he pretends that Alliser orders Janos to go down to Castle Black. Later, two giants and a mammoth attempt to break through the gate. Jon orders Grenn to take five men and defend the inner gate. Grenn chooses Donnel Hill, Cooper, and three other brothers. Arriving at the inner gate, they watch a giant, Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg, managing to push the outer gate up to pass. Cooper cowers when faced by the giant charging at them, but Grenn convinces him to stay by reciting the Night's Watch oath. The black brothers ready their weapons just as the giant rams the inner gate. They successfully kill the giant and hold the gate, but all of the black brothers are slain in the process. Their bodies are discovered by Jon and Sam after the battle and Jon kneels down and closes his eyes.\n\nWhen Jon speaks with Mance Rayder after the battle, Mance mentions the giant that was slain by Grenn and his companions. He tells Jon that the giant was known as \"Mag the Mighty\", a king among the giants from a bloodline from before the time of the First Men. Jon tells Mance that Grenn came from a farm. Jon and Mance drink to their memories. After the arrival of Stannis Baratheon and his forces, Grenn is among the numerous bodies of fallen black brothers burned in Castle Black's courtyard.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Grenn"}}

He considers himself a traveler, having once fought for the Sealord of Braavos, lived in Volantis for a time, traveled to Slaver's Bay once, which he describes as 'sweaty'.\n\nLord Tarwick was invited to the royal wedding. While there, he is seen conversing with Lord Morgryn before talking to Sera Durwell, who hoped to marry a suitable noble.\n\nLater, on their way to the throne room, Sera describes Garibald to Mira Forrester, stating he has a funny accent.\n\nLord Tarwick is accompanied to Tommen's coronation feast by Sera, joking along. Once Sera sees Mira, she tells Tarwick she will meet him inside, and he goes in.\n\nOnce the two handmaidens enter the feast, Garibald greets the two, commenting that he had hoped Sera had not run off with Mira, although he would not blame her if he did. Sera formally introduces the two. Tarwick states that Mira is quite lovely. He remarks about it is quite a feast, but jokingly states to be careful around the wine, and depending if you did or did not drink the wine with Sera in episode 2, he will either state that he heard Mira didn't partake in that, or that she's partial to a particular Arbor red. Mira briefly stares at Sera before returning her attention to Tarwick.\n\nHe states that nothing you do in King's Landing goes unnoticed, before he is interrupted by another man, who waves to him. Garibald quickly folds his arms and turns around, ignoring him. Sera questions what that was about, but Tarwick refuses to disclose, believing not fit for her delicate ears, and the two laugh at it while Mira stares at Andros and Rickard Morgryn arguing. While Mira leaves to go investigate who is helping Lord Whitehill, Tarwick begins to tell Sera a story about the Tourney at Lannisport, but Sera interjects, reminding him that he told her that story before, but he continues, reminiscing how they danced all evening, drank wine from their helmets, and the food.\n\nIf Mira eavesdrops on Sera and Tarwick, she can hear Sera telling a joke to Tarwick, with which she finds terrible even though she is telling the joke about a cock. When talked to, he warmly greets Mira, and asks if Mira has had any luck. Mira is confused at this, and he cites if Mira was eavesdropping or talking to anyone, and assumed she was on the lookout for a husband. Sera comments that is not really what Mira is interested in, but Garibald dismisses this, believing she must have her eye on someone. Mira can name some men, including Garibald himself, and gain information on them.\n\nWhen Andros yells at Mira for talking with Lyman Lannister, Tarwick looks on concerned. With Lady Margaery Tyrell's arrival, and Sera joining her, Garibald comforts her on the scene she just caused. Mira states she can handle Lord Andros, but Tarwick responds that it was Lyman he was worried about. Mira is confused about this, and tries to press further, but Tarwick admits it is not a story fit for a maiden's ears.\n\nMira wishes to learn more, so Tarwick asks about Sera's family. He notes how her name, Sera Durwell, is interesting because the last Durwells went extinct 200 years ago. He asks Mira what she could tell him about her family. Mira can either lie to Lord Tarwick, mentioning that she met the Durwells while she was at Highgarden, or admit that Sera is a bastard and that the Tyrells renamed her. He then tells Mira about how Lyman Lannister was involved in an accident at the tourney at Lannisport, where he fell from his horse and need milk of the poppy for weeks to keep him from screaming, and he continues to drink it to this day. He states that he learned it from Andros, whose mouth is bigger than the Blackwater. If Mira lied, Tarwick states that he has some arrangements to make. If Mira revealed the truth, he instead states he has some arrangements to undo.\n\nIf you lied to Tarwick, Sera mentions that now that he and she are discussing marriage, she can't risk being associated with Mira, and that Mira knows how much Sera needs the marriage.\n\nIf you told the truth to Tarwick, Sera will instead mention that now Garibald is refusing to talk to her, she cannot risk being associated with Mira because Margaery is her only protection without Garibald.\n\nTarwick appears in this episode if Mira lied to him about Sera's parentage and refused Morgryn's marriage proposal.

He was married to both of his sisters, Visenya and Rhaenys.","After the Conquest, Aegon ruled for thirty more years, apparently wisely and well. However, upon his death the realm was plunged into a bloody war when the Faith of the Seven rejected his sons, born of incest, from following him on the throne. Eventually the uprising was put down and the Targaryen rule secured for centuries."],"name":"Aegon I Targaryen","description":"Aegon I Targaryen was the first king of the Targaryen dynasty. He was a warlord and Lord of Dragonstone who, with his two sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys, three great dragons and a small army, invaded and unified six of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in the War of Conquest; only Dorne managed to successfully resist the Targaryens, using guerilla tactics to resist the dragons until voluntarily joining the Seven Kingdoms with a peaceful marriage alliance.\n\nAfterwards, Aegon founded the city of King's Landing, began construction on the Red Keep, and forged the Iron Throne from the swords of his defeated enemies, melted with dragonfire. His descendants ruled the Seven Kingdoms for a further three centuries.\n\nSansa Stark is given a history lesson by Septa Mordane while visiting the throne room in the Red Keep. Aegon the Conqueror is mentioned as the king who unified the Seven Kingdoms and forged the Iron Throne.\n\nIn Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys Targaryen and Ser Jorah Mormont discuss Aegon's invasion of Westeros and how he unified six of the Seven Kingdoms (the seventh, Dorne, was not added to the realm until some time later) some three hundred years ago. Jorah points out that Aegon had no \"right\" to the Seven Kingdoms, and never made any legal claim for his conquest: he conquered most of Westeros because he could. Daenerys points out that he could because he had dragons. Jorah expresses doubt that Aegon had dragons, indicating the events happened so long ago it's impossible to be sure.\n\nWhile at Harrenhal, Lord Tywin Lannister recounts to Arya Stark the history of the castle. King Harren the Black of the Ironborn wanted to establish a legacy by constructing Harrenhal, the biggest castle ever built on the entire continent. Harrenhal was designed to defend against an attack from the land, and as Tywin muses, \"a million men could have marched against its walls, and a million men would have been repelled.\" However, Harren did not anticipate an attack from the Targaryen dragons, who during the War of Conquest flew right over the high walls and attacked with dragonfire. As Tywin summed it up, \"Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.\" Harren and all of his sons were roasted alive within their own hall by Aegon's dragons, and Harrenhal was left a blasted ruin. However, Arya Stark notes that Aegon was assisted by his sisters in his conquest of Westeros rather than acting alone.\n\nIn the Great Pyramid of Meereen, Tyrion Lannister compares the dragons used by Aegon the Conqueror during his conquest of Westeros to Daenerys's dragons. He makes a point to Varys, Missandei, and Grey Worm about how Daenerys's ancestors after Aegon began locking up their dragons, leading them to shrink in size and eventually go extinct entirely. Tyrion uses this in an attempt to persuade the three to free Daenerys's dragons from their captivity, having been placed there due to Daenerys being unable to control them across Slaver's Bay. Tyrion later unchains the dragons.\n\nWhile having a vision of the past, Bran Stark learns that his \"half-brother\" Jon Snow is actually the son of his aunt Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, Daenerys's brother, making Jon another descendant of Aegon the Conqueror. Around this time, Jon is declared the new King in the North despite his status as a bastard son (but in reality nephew) of the late Eddard Stark. Meanwhile, Daenerys sets sail for Westeros with her armada and dragons with the same intentions as Aegon had: to conquer the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nWhen Jon Snow appears before Daenerys Targaryen at Dragonstone, the latter scoffs when Ser Davos Seaworth presents Jon as the King in the North and declares that the last person who held that title was Torrhen Stark, who bent the knee to Aegon in his conquest, apparently not recognizing Robb Stark as the most recent King in the North.\n\nAfter Bran Stark reveals to Samwell Tarly at Winterfell that Jon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark and Samwell tells Bran that the High Septon had Rhaegar's marriage to Elia Martell annulled, Bran uses the sight to look once more into the past at the Tower of Joy, where he witnesses Rhaegar and Lyanna's marriage and Lyanna giving birth to their son, who she tells her brother Ned is named Aegon Targaryen, apparently after Aegon the Conqueror as many Targaryens had been before.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Aegon_I_Targaryen"}}

He is the primary military advisor to House Stark of Winterfell. House Stark are Lords Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm.\n\nRodrik is a knight, which is somewhat unusual in the North where most of the population holds to the Old Gods of the Forest. He fought in Robert's Rebellion and is an old friend of both Lord Eddard Stark and Jon Umber, the Lord of Last Hearth. His nephew Jory Cassel also fought in the rebellion and is the Captain of the guards at Winterfell. Rodrik is much beloved and respected by the inhabitants of Winterfell, and bears a distinct \"muttonchop\" facial hair pattern.\n\nSer Rodrik informs Lord Eddard Stark that Will, a deserter from the Night's Watch, has been caught in the hills. He accompanies Eddard to Will's execution. On the way back to Winterfell he witnesses the discovery of the six direwolf pups in the Wolfswood. The Stark children adopt the pups. King Robert Baratheon visits Winterfell and Ser Rodrik assembles with the rest of the household to welcome him. Robert asks Eddard to serve as hand of the King. Bran Stark is found severely injured at the base of a disused tower. Eddard goes south to King's Landing and Jory accompanies him as the Captain of his personal guard while Rodrik remains in Winterfell. An assassin infiltrates the castle and attempts to kill Bran but is foiled by Catelyn and Bran's direwolf Summer. Rodrik identifies the blade carried by the assassin as Valyrian steel. Catelyn suspects House Lannister and decides to warn Eddard personally. Rodrik offers to send a squad of guards with her but she is concerned about drawing attention. He offers to accompany her personally and she agrees.\n\nRodrik and Catelyn arrive in King's Landing. He escorts her during through the city and they are told that Littlefinger lost the blade used by the assassin gambling with Tyrion Lannister. They set out for Winterfell. At the Inn at the Crossroads, Rodrik unsuccessfully attempts to dismiss the singer Marillion. He helps Catelyn take Tyrion Lannister prisoner when he arrives at the inn.\n\nThey head east through the Vale of Arryn. Rodrik helps fend off an attack by the hill tribes and receives a minor wound, but is able to complete the journey to the Eyrie. Rodrik's nephew Jory Cassel is killed by Jaime Lannister while protecting Eddard in King's Landing.\n\nRodrik witnesses Tyrion's trial by combat and is disappointed when Tyrion's champion wins. King Robert dies following a hunting mishap and Eddard questions the lineage of his successor, Joffrey Baratheon. Eddard is arrested for treason and held in the dungeons of King's Landing until the newly-crowned King Joffrey orders him beheaded, prompting the North to secede and rise in anger and rebellion. Rodrik accompanies Catelyn to Moat Cailin, where they find Robb Stark's army camped, where he greets Jon Umber like a longtime friend. Robb needs to cross the river Trident but is unsure of the support of Lord Walder Frey. Rodrik advises Catelyn to not go into the Twins alone to talk to Lord Frey. She does so anyway and negotiates safe passage. Robb wins a victory in the Battle of the Whispering Wood and captures Jaime. News of Eddard's execution reaches the camp and Rodrik is part of the group that proclaims Robb Stark the King in the North.\n\nSer Rodrik is present when King Robb presents Ser Alton Lannister the peace terms he must deliver to the Iron Throne. Robb sends Ser Rodrik back to Winterfell to keep Bran and Rickon safe while Catelyn goes to the Stormlands to treat with King Renly Baratheon.\n\nSer Rodrik enters the Great Hall of Winterfell calling for Bran. He reports that Torrhen\u2019s Square is under siege. Maester Luwin is shocked, remarking that Torrhen\u2019s Square is just 14 leagues away and wonders how the Lannisters have reached so far north. Osha listens intently as she lights candles at the back of the room. Ser Rodrik speculates that it could be a raiding party led by the Mountain or a group of sellswords. Bran says that they must help their bannermen. Rodrik nods agreement and says that even with most of their forces fighting for Robb he can gather 200 decent men. Luwin wonders if Rodrik needs to take so many and Bran cautions that they must protect their bannermen if they expect their bannermen to protect them. Rodrik smiles at the boy\u2019s wisdom and Bran orders him to leave as soon as he has his men. Rodrik confidently says that it will not take long because southerners do not do well in their territory.\n\nIt turns out, however, that the siege at Torrhen's Square was a feint planted by Theon Greyjoy to draw the main garrison away from Winterfell, leaving the poorly defended capital open to attack. Rodrik is caught on his way back from Torrhen's Square. He managed to cut down two of Theon's men, before being disarmed by Black Lorren.\n\nHe is dragged into Winterfell in a fury at Theon Greyjoy. Theon is going to have him thrown in the dungeon, but when Ser Rodrik spits in Theon's face, Dagmer insists Rodrik \"has to pay the iron price\" otherwise Theon's men will lose respect for him. Theon is visibly shaken at the prospect of having to execute someone who once trained him, but he agrees and sentences Rodrik to death in order to save face with his fellow ironborn. Bran vehemently protests as Theon had promised earlier that nobody would be harmed if he yielded. Luwin tries to convince Theon that Rodrik is worth more to him alive than dead, but Theon dismisses him. Defiant to the end, Ser Rodrik baits Theon into performing the execution himself by reminding him of how in Winterfell, the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. As Theon unsheathes his sword, Bran wails for him to stop but Ser Rodrik tells him to be calm, saying, \"I'm off to see your father.\" Theon asks if Rodrik has any last words before his beheading, and Rodrik scornfully replies that Theon is truly lost. Rodrik then bravely bows his head and awaits his fate with dignity, but Theon botches the task of executing him with just one blow. It takes him three more sword strikes and a kick to finally behead Ser Rodrik, to the horror of the onlookers and Bran, who continues sobbing.\n\nWhile using Greensight to view the past, Bran and the Three-eyed raven watch a younger Ser Rodrik training a young Eddard and Benjen Stark at swordplay. He is shown having been present when Hodor suffers a mental trauma and seizes, restraining a terrified Benjen Stark. In the present, Theon mentions his killing of Ser Rodrik along with his other crimes as a reason why Jon Snow will kill him before parting ways with Sansa Stark.\n\nWhen Arya Stark returns to Winterfell, she asks for Rodrik and Maester Luwin to prove her identity to two disbelieving guards, but is informed that there is no one currently of that name at Winterfell, confirming his death to Arya.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rodrik_Cassel"}}

His fifth A Song of Ice and Fire novel, A Dance with Dragons, is dedicated to the Brotherhood Without Banners."],"name":"Brotherhood Without Banners","description":"The Brotherhood Without Banners was formed in the aftermath of the Battle at the Mummer's Ford. Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King to Robert Baratheon, charged Lord Beric Dondarrion with bringing the King's Justice onto Ser Gregor Clegane after receiving reports from harassed smallfolk that the Mountain was terrorizing the Riverlands. This was being done clandestinely on the orders of his liege, Lord Tywin Lannister, whose son Tyrion had been arrested by Catelyn Stark, the daughter of Hoster Tully, lord of the Riverlands, and accused of attempting to murder her son Bran. The survivors were trapped behind enemy lines when Joffrey Baratheon ascended the Iron Throne with Tywin Lannister as the new Hand, but led by Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, they formed the Brotherhood to harass Lannister forces. Over time, they began to feel that none of the factions in the War of the Five Kings were looking out for the welfare of the commoners. Stark raiding parties would burn out farms in the Riverlands just to deny their resources to the Lannisters, and the Lannisters would do the same.\n\nThe Brotherhood therefore decided to fight for no \"banner\" of one king or another in the war, but to fight to defend the common people against raiding parties of soldiers who prey on the weak during the war. From the core group which was originally sent out by Eddard Stark - and contained some of his own household guards from Winterfell - the Brotherhood gained new members during the course of the war as it was joined by Stark deserters, Baratheon deserters, and simple commoners who wanted to defend their homes.\n\nIn short, the Brotherhood Without Banners are a rag-tag band of misfits who rob from the rich to give to the poor, making hit-and-run attacks then retreating back to the forests.\n\nAt Harrenhal, the Lannister torturer known as the Tickler interrogates prisoners from a nearby village and demands to know where the Brotherhood is, what they are planning and which villagers are collaborating with them.\n\nAfter the poisoning of Ser Amory Lorch, Ser Gregor Clegane believes the Brotherhood Without Banners is responsible. Lord Tywin Lannister considers the name to be grandiose for a band of brigands and outlaws. Tywin is angered that the Brotherhood is operating behind the Lannister lines and harrying their forces with impunity.\n\nFollowing their escape from Harrenhal, Arya, Hot Pie, and Gendry are ambushed by the Brotherhood as they attempt to make their way to Riverrun. The trio are questioned by Thoros, who mistakes them for war refugees, and invites them back to a nearby inn for food and drink. The Brotherhood also captures Sandor Clegane, who identifies Arya.\n\nThe Brotherhood refuses to let Arya go, effectively making her their hostage. Meanwhile, Gendry chooses to join them. After he is set free by the Brotherhood, Sandor abducts Arya.\n\nLothar Frey and Walder Rivers report to their father that, besides the Riverlords that have risen against House Frey, the Brotherhood is rallying the commoners against them and is striking against their supply lines and camps in the Riverlands.\n\nThree riders scout out rebuilding smallfolk, among them, Sandor Clegane, the younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane. The riders demand whatever supplies they can get, though the leader of the community, Ray, tells them that they have nothing to offer. The riders depart with an excerpt of a prayer to the Lord of Light, and the Hound realizes that they are from the Brotherhood. The community is later found dead to a man, and the Brotherhood is implied to be responsible.\n\nThe Hound, angered that his peaceful community was slaughtered, resolves to find the men responsible. He encounters a small group of them, among them two of the assailants. He effortlessly kills them all, and tracks down the others in the group, which leads him to the Brotherhood leadership. Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr have already put nooses around the necks of the other men responsible for the attack, and allow the Hound to personally hang two of them. Beric and Thoros then try to recruit the Hound into their newest mission: traveling north to fight a great evil that threatens all of humanity regardless of which banner they fall behind.\n\nThe Brotherhood, with Sandor Clegane now part of the group, continues its march north under Lord Beric Dondarrion and the red priest Thoros. They arrive at a farm once owned by a farmer encountered by the Hound during his travels with Arya Stark. The Hound is reluctant to stay there, but the Brotherhood needs a place to stop, rest, and warm now that winter had come. While some of the Brotherhood looks around for any hidden grain or wealth and Thoros lights a fire by a nearby hearth, the Hound and Beric mourn the skeletons of the farmer and his daughter and wonder how they died. Beric postulates that they were starving, and rather than let his daughter starve to death, the father ended it quickly for the both of them.\n\nThe two sit down, and the Hound wonders aloud why the Lord of Light keeps letting Thoros bring Beric back from the dead and expresses his continued disbelief in R'hllor. Thoros summons the Hound to the fire he has lit and implores him to look into the flames, where the Hound witnesses a vision of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea along the Wall and a mountain shaped like an arrowhead. He sees the White Walkers and dead things marching on the Wall, which disturbs him.\n\nLater, Thoros finds the Hound digging graves for the farmer and his daughter. He mourns their deaths, saying that they did not deserve to die. Thoros looks on, surprised by the Hound.\n\nAbout a mile south of the Wall, they are spotted and captured by a group of wildlings serving alongside the Night's Watch at Eastwatch. Shortly afterwards, King Jon Snow and his men arrive to travel beyond the wall to capture a wight as evidence for the queens in the south. After Jon states that they do not have enough men, Tormund Giantsbane leads them to the cells to meet with Beric, Thoros and the Hound, claiming they want to go north of the Wall too. Jon immediately recognizes the Hound after seeing him originally at Winterfell. Gendry advises not to trust them since they sold him to the Red Women to be murdered. Ser Jorah Mormount also recognizes Thoros after fighting alongside him during the Greyjoy Rebellion. Due to much tension in the room, Beric begins an impassioned speech that the Lord of Light brought them together, but Sandor cuts him off and asks Jon if they are coming with them. Jon agrees, claiming that they are all on the same side because they are \"all breathing\".\n\nThe Brotherhood, Jon, Jorah, Gendry, Tormund and a few other wildlings then pass through the gate and meet a giant snowstorm.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Brotherhood_Without_Banners"}}

Not much is known about his past or family. Both his parents beat him.","Bronn finds Tyrion a whore named Shae amongst the camp-followers. The three of them play drinking games on the eve of the Battle of the Green Fork. Bronn reveals that his parents beat him, that he killed for the first time before the age of twelve (a woman who attacked him with an axe), and that he has been beyond the Wall. Bronn awakens to find the opposing army almost upon them. Bronn rouses Tyrion and advises him on how to survive.

He now styles himself as \"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater\", and while possessing no lands, wealth, or titles, this drastically elevates his social standing - and in his mind, his pay.

During a sword training sparring session on the Red Keep's riverside, Bronn implores Jaime to visit his brother in the dungeon. He tells him that Tyrion originally named Jaime as his champion in the Eyrie because he knew Jaime would ride day and night to fight for him, and asks Jaime if he is prepared to fight for him now.","Bronn is later released from custody and brought before Doran Martell on Jaime's request. Though Doran is prepared to punish Bronn for his actions, Jaime speaks up for him, claiming that Bronn was only following his orders. Bronn's fate is left up to Trystane, who agrees to show Bronn mercy and set him free, on the condition that Hotah strike him across the face in retaliation for Bronn having struck him earlier.

The sellsword is jubilant to see his old friend and the two exchange jokes about sex and sword-fighting skills. Bronn then offers to give Podrick a lesson in \"dirty fighting\", which the latter accepts.","Following the battle, Bronn complains that he still has not been paid in full, alluding to his promised castle and implying that he wants Highgarden, but Jaime denies him the castle. On the way back, Bronn asks Dickon Tarly for his honest opinion about war, and is amused at the young lord's lack of frontline combat experience. Shortly after, however, the Lannister garrison comes under attack by Daenerys Targaryen and her Dothraki army. Bronn implores Jaime to flee back to King's Landing, to no avail. As Daenerys unleashes Drogon on the Lannisters' spoils from Highgarden, Jaime commands Bronn to get to Qyburn's scorpion ballista. Bronn catches the eye of a Dothraki bloodrider, who chases him across the battlefield, intent on killing him. Bronn reaches the carriage with the ballista and kills the bloodrider with a bolt to the heart, and reloads the weapon. He fires at Drogon and misses, but gets Daenerys's attention, who swoops down at him to destroy the ballista. With Drogon in firing range, Bronn takes aim and fires again, striking Drogon in the shoulder, initially with enough damage to cause Drogon (with Daenaerys riding him) to start falling, but ultimately it's not enough and Drogon narrowly avoids hitting the ground and destroys the ballista with dragonfire; Bronn jumps to safety in time, and when Jaime foolishly attempts to slay Daenerys from behind only to be met with dragonfire, Bronn tackles him to safety and they both fall into the river. In the aftermath from the Battle, Bronn pulls Jaime from the depths of the water, and onto the shore, after Jaime's failed attempt to slay Daenerys and end the war. Bronn tells Jaime that the only reason he rescued him is so he may be the one to ever finish him off, until he gets what he wants from him. Jaime remarks on the power of the dragons and realizes they are in great peril if Daenerys chooses to use all three in future battles. Bronn assures that he won't be around for such an assault, as Jaime laments his duty to report what happened to Cersei. Bronn thinks it would be safer for him to jump back into the river than deal with Cersei's wrath.","Hearing about the failed attempt on Bronn's life, Cersei is not really concerned that he survived, thinking of him as merely an annoyance (in contrast to her other \"enemies\" that she fears of in her paranoid delusions). She intends to make him pay for being in league with her brother, but she is in no hurry. She toys with the idea of sending Loras Tyrell to kill Bronn, if he returns alive from Dragonstone, hoping they might kill each other.

Despite Bronn's avaricious nature, which is sneered at by more honorable knights, he is a skilled and dangerous fighter. His combat style centers around speed and agility, dodging enemy attacks instead of blocking them. For this reason, he does not wear heavy armor or capes or use shields, but instead relies on just his sword and knives. He is also a skilled archer and is apparently literate. His pragmatic approach to combat is the main reason why he refused to fight the Mountain in Tyrion's second trial by combat despite his superior stamina and speed, explaining \"One misstep, and I'm dead\".\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bronn"}}

Peterson on Forbes.com in November 2012, there is actually only one line in the Dothraki language in Season 3 of the TV series. This brief line occurred when Daenerys and Missandei are discussing the Dothraki language in \"Second Sons\":\n\nZhey Drogo ast me-Dothraki thasho h\u2019anhaan ven anha ray yol mehas. Me azh maan atjakhar.\n\n\"Athjahakar\u200B\" was intentionally slurred as \"atjakhar\" so Missandei could correct Daenerys's mistake.\n\nThe Dothraki language was created by David J. Peterson of the Language Creation Society, and as of May 2015 has a vocabulary of over 4,000 words. On the May 18 2015 episode of the Lexicon Valley podcast, Peterson said he would like to see the language increase to 10,000 words. He has also worked on other languages for the show, such as High Valyrian, Skroth and Asshai'i.\n\nWhile Peterson does transfer his final notes on languages he has invented into computer files, during the earliest stages when he is sketching out the details of one of his constructed languages he prefers to work with a pen and paper. Peterson's initial drafts of the Dothraki language were actually written in a Winnie the Pooh brand children's notebook.\n\nPeterson described part of his creation process for Dothraki:\n\nThe High Valyrian word for \"book\" is \"tembyr\", while the Dothraki word for book is \"timvir\". Similarly, there is no exact equivalent to \"throne\" in Dothraki: Khal Drogo uses the Dothraki word \"ador\" which literally means \"chair\", but Daenerys explains that this doesn't really convey the full symbolic meaning give to \"throne\", so Drogo then says \"throne\" as a direct loanword. Moreover, the Dothraki live on the central plains of the continent and fear the ocean, so because they don't sail on ships and rarely even see them, they don't really have a word for \"boat\". Therefore, as shown in the on-screen subtitles, when Khal Drogo describes traveling in ships to Westeros, he literally says \"wooden horses\" (hrazef ido), because it is conceptually the closest word for \"thing you ride on\" in his language.\n\nDavid J. Peterson produced a guidebook for learning the Dothraki language, Living Language Dothraki, released in October 2014.\n\nArguably, given the sheer size of the Dothraki Sea, the Dothraki language approaches the Common Tongue of Westeros and the Low Valyrian languages spoken throughout the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay in terms of overall geographical spread. However, the actual population density of the Dothraki Sea is very small, as Dothraki khalasars ride through massive grassy plains which are otherwise devoid of permanent habitation. If plotted on a map, this makes the Dothraki language look disproportionately common.\n\nThe population of the only Dothraki city, Vaes Dothrak, varies from time to time: there are rarely more than a few khalasars stopping in the city at any one time, before leaving again to find plunder. As a result, the permanent population of the city isn't much compared to one of the Free Cities or to a Westerosi city such as King's Landing. However, Vaes Dothrak is physically large enough to hold every khalasar if they return all at once (for special religious ceremonies, etc.). Daenerys estimates that it physically has ten times as many buildings as Pentos does, and Pentos is one of the more populous Free Cities (the most populous, however, is Volantis). This might give a general idea of the size of the overall Dothraki population.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dothraki do not engage in long-distance trade, which has severely hampered the geographical spread of their language. Some of their neighbors have learned Dothraki in order to treat with them (i.e. in the TV series, Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos is seen speaking Dothraki to Khal Drogo), but their language has not spread with trade along sea lanes. In contrast, the Common Tongue of Westeros has spread along with merchant ships so that many traders in the Free Cities and Slaver's Bay have some knowledge of it to conduct business in. Even the inhabitants of distant Qarth conduct sea trade with Westeros, and thus some knowledge of the Common Tongue may be found there. Similarly, Valyrian-speakers from the Free Cities may be found in the five major port cities of Westeros.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dothraki_(language)"}}

Taking the coin and handing it to her she nervously accepts it as the dwarf smiles, after thanking them she watches as the two walk away.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Meereenese_homeless_mother"}}

He had the Great Sept of Baelor, which became the center of the Faith of the Seven, built during his reign in the city of King's Landing. A large statue of him was later erected in front of the Great Sept.\n\nDuring his reign, he had the Maidenvault built inside the Red Keep and imprisoned his three sisters to prevent carnal temptations.\n\nThough famed for his holiness and piety, he was also a religious zealot. Among Baelor's follies, he named a six-year-old boy as High Septon because he was convinced the child could work miracles after he talked to a dove. He also gave the title to a simple stonemason because he believed he was The Smith reincarnated. Baelor also saved his cousin Aemon Targaryen from a snake pit, thinking that the vipers would not harm a man who was so devoted to the Faith. However, he was bitten twelve times and was forced to lay in bed for six months. He starved himself into an early grave with his frequent religious fasting, believing that the Known world was sinful and food was from the Known world.\n\nGiven that Baelor abhorred desires of the flesh, he died without issue and was succeeded by his uncle and Hand, Viserys II Targaryen.\n\nWhen Eddard Stark is dragged out of the dungeons to make a forced (and false) confession of treason on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor, he spots his daughter Arya (who escaped capture by the Lannisters) hiding in the crowd near a statue of King Baelor. He also sees the loyal Night's Watch recruiter Yoren in the crowd, and as the guards lead him past he utters one quick word to him: \"Baelor\". This directs Yoren's attention to the statue, and notices Arya.\n\nAfter Eddard makes his false confession, Grand Maester Pycelle pontificates to the crowd that Baelor taught the realm mercy, which is why Lord Stark's life will be spared and he will be exiled to the Wall. King Joffrey, however, in a display of petty cruelty says that mercy is for women, and demands that Eddard be executed on the spot. Ser Ilyn then beheads Lord Stark. Thanks to Eddard's warning, however, Yoren is able to drag the terrified Arya away and successfully assists her in escaping from the city.\n\nTyrion Lannister mentions that Baelor the Blessed is one of the kings analyzed in the classic book, Lives of Four Kings.\n\nTywin Lannister recounts Baelor the Blessed's follies, including naming a six-year-old boy as High Septon, while conversing with his grandson, Tommen Baratheon, about the necessary qualities required in a good king.\n\nWhile meeting at a chapel deep below the Great Sept of Baelor, the High Sparrow tells Queen Cersei that Baelor built his Great Sept atop the more humble sept. He praises the sept's builders, who didn't leave their names or any sign of their identities, for not inflicting their vanity on those who came after them, unlike Baelor with his \"gilded monstrosity\".\n\nJust after the trial of Ser Loras Tyrell, the Great Sept of Baelor is destroyed with wildfire in a plot orchestrated by Cersei Lannister so that she could evade her own trial, which was scheduled to take place just after Loras's, and destroy her enemies.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Baelor_Targaryen"}}

There is no indication so far that Missandei's Unsullied brothers will appear in the TV series."],"name":"Missandei","description":"Missandei was born on the island of Naath in the Summer Sea, off the coast of the continent of Sothoryos. She was enslaved at a young age and taken to Slaver's Bay in Essos, where she was eventually put to work as an interpreter for the slaver-master Kraznys mo Nakloz, one of the Good Masters of Astapor.\n\nMissandei speaks nineteen languages including High Valyrian (her favorite), the Low Valyrian dialect of Slaver's Bay, Dothraki, the Common Tongue of Westeros, and has some knowledge of the functionally dead language of the Ghiscari Empire.\n\nMissandei acts as an interpreter between her master Kraznys mo Nakloz and Daenerys Targaryen when she lands on Astapor with the intent to buy Unsullied. She does not simply translate, but offers Kraznys commentary on Daenerys's words and diplomatically leaves out Kraznys's insults to the Khaleesi.\n\nDaenerys meets with Kraznys and other Good Masters and announces her intention to buy all of the eight thousand Unsullied for sale, but Kraznys says she cannot afford them. The slaver grows increasingly insulting and condescending - which makes Missandei struggle to interpret politely. Daenerys then adds she also wants to buy the hundreds of young men still in training. In exchange she offers one of her dragons. The Good Masters agree, but Daenerys also asks for Missandei as a gift and a show of good faith for the upcoming transaction. He agrees, and Missandei follows Daenerys.\n\nDaenerys asks the young slave for her name and if she has any living family, but she says she does not. Daenerys warns her that she is heading into war and she may be killed or may fall sick and die, to which Missandei simply recites the Valyrian aphorism: \"Valar morghulis\". Daenerys responds by correctly interpreting, \"all men must die\" but also adds that \"we are not men\", making Missandei grin.\n\nMissandei, sporting a new dress to match Daenerys's outfit, is present when Kraznys and Daenerys conduct their exchange. She interprets their exchange until Daenerys fluidly begins issuing orders to the Unsullied in perfectly accented Low Valyrian, at which Missandei stares in shock. Missandei survives the subsequent sack of Astapor and marches out of the city with Daenerys.\n\nMissandei serves as Daenerys's primary aide-de-camp during the march to Yunkai. On her queen's orders, she gathers the Unsullied officers together and orders them to select a single leader from among themselves. When the new leader, Grey Worm, is presented, Missandei explains that all Unsullied are given names consisting of drab colors and vermin to remind them of their station. Daenerys promptly orders the Unsullied to select their own names, though Grey Worm elects to keep his.\n\nMissandei later attends to Daenerys and her guests Mero, Prendahl na Ghezn and Daario Naharis. Mero is rather uncouth throughout the whole event, groping Missandei and even trying smell her. In part because of his treatment of Missandei, the khaleesi orders that Mero be killed first if the Unsullied must fight the Second Sons. That night, as Daenerys bathes, she is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks no fewer than nineteen languages. Missandei says this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of Dothraki. The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable Dothraki and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an Unsullied enters and hold a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He explains he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains, but they ran into a philosophical disagreement over her beauty. He then releases Missandei and produces his captains' severed heads.\n\nMissandei is later on hand as Daenerys waits for word of the infiltration of Yunkai and when Yunkai's gates open. She at first recites a prepared speech on how Daenerys has freed the slaves, but the khaleesi interrupts with a speech of her own. When the freed slaves begin calling Daenerys \"mhysa\", Missandei explains the word's Ghiscari origins and its meaning, \"mother\".\n\nMissandei remains Daenerys's aide-de-camp in the weeks following the fall of Yunkai. When an irritated Daenerys locates Grey Worm and Daario, Missandei informs them that they have been at their contest (balancing their swords to see who will have the honor of riding at the queen's side) since midnight. Missandei is amused when Daenerys threatens to expel the winner of the contest from her army. Later on, Missandei discusses the Great Masters with the queen, and suggests that if they are smart, they should be afraid.\n\nAt the gates of Meereen, Missandei interprets the words of Meereen's champion to Daenerys. She is clearly reluctant to accurately interpret the Meereenese Valyrian and cleans up the language slightly when relaying the message. A few minutes later, when Daario is selected as the champion, Missandei makes complimentary remarks about him, which Daenerys brushes off.\n\nMissandei is revealed to have been teaching Grey Worm the Common Tongue. As the lessons progress, Missandei and Grey Worm discuss their lost homelands (Naath and the Summer Isles respectively) and Grey Worm's eagerness to kill the Masters of Slaver's Bay.\n\nMissandei is later present when Daenerys mulls over the possibility of seizing King's Landing. She later acts as herald and interpreter while Daenerys, acting as queen of Meereen, hears petitions from her new subjects.\n\nWhile bathing nude in a stream outside the city, Missandei notices Grey Worm gazing at her. Surprised by this, she stands up, allowing him to see her wholly before she covers herself.\n\nLater she discusses what happened with Daenerys, who says Unsullied aren't interested in women. Missandei says he was, though, surprising as it seems. Daenerys asks her whether, when a slave is castrated, the masters take both the \"pillar\" and the \"stones.\" Missandei does not know, and Daenerys asks whether she's ever wondered. Missandei thoughtfully confirms she has. Grey Worm later comes to apologize, but she tells him there is no need. She expresses sympathy over what was done to him, but he replies that if it had not happened, the course of events that eventually led to their meeting would not have occurred, which visibly moves her. As he turns to leave, Missandei says she is glad he saw her, to which he says he is as well. She is later present when Jorah is dismissed from Daenerys's service and banished.\n\nMissandei is again on hand when a farmer delivers to Daenerys the remains of his three-year old girl, who was burned to death by Drogon.\n\nMissandei is with Daenerys when she learns that an Unsullied named White Rat is murdered in a brothel. She then approaches Grey Worm, asking why an Unsullied would want to go to a brothel. Grey Worm states that he does not know and leaves.\n\nMissandei is at Daenerys's council when they discuss what should be done with the Son of the Harpy who has been arrested. Later, she is present when Mossador is publicly executed for murdering the prisoner before a fair trial could take place. She flees with Daenerys once a riot breaks out after the execution.\n\nMissandei is present alongside Daenerys and Daario when Hizdahr zo Loraq yet again tries to convince to Daenerys that the fighting pits of Meereen should be reopened.\n\nMissandei is tearfully watching over Grey Worm as he is lying unconscious on a bed. She is present later when Grey Worm wakes up from lying unconsious in three days. Grey Worm states that he feels ashamed of himself for being afraid, to which Missandei reponds that all men fear death. Grey Worm then says that the reason he was afraid wasn't because of death itself but because he would never be able to see \"Missandei from the Island of Naath\" again. Missandei is touched with tears by this and leans over to give Grey Worm a kiss. Missandei is later asked for advise by Daenerys regarding her current situation. Missandei say that she doesn't think she is fit to give advice to a queen, which Daenerys thinks is absurd and states that she thinks Missandei is as fit as anyone to have a say in this. Missandei says that instead of listening to her counselors Daenerys should perhaps listen to her heart instead. This leads to Daenerys reopening the fighting pits and proposing to Hizdahr.\n\nMissandei is present when Tyrion and Jorah are brought before Daenerys in the Great Pyramid. She witnesses as Tyrion explains himself and when Jorah is again banished from Meereen.\n\nMissandei later attends Daenerys during the opening games at Daznak's Pit. She remains quiet through most of the proceedings, observing the verbal sparring between Hizdahr and Daario and looking at Dany with concern when Jorah shows up again. When the Sons of the Harpy rise up begin slaughtering the spectators, Missandei is momentarily forgotten by Daario and Jorah, who are busy trying to get Daenerys away. Missandei is rescued by Tyrion, who kills a Harpy's Son and gets them behind a line of Unsullied. Thinking she is about to die, Daenerys grabs Missandei's hand, but the group is rescued by Drogon seconds later. Missandei and the others watch in amazement when Dany rides off on Drogon's back.\n\nAs Tyrion, Jorah, and Daario argue over how to proceed, Missandei bring Grey Worm to them. Missandei attempts to explain to Grey Worm how Tyrion saved her, attempts to diplomatically avoid using the High Valyrian for \"dwarf\", although Tyrion, in typical bluntness, corrects her. She repays the favor by telling Tyrion that his High Valyrian is \"rusty\" as opposed to \"nostril\". When Daario and Jorah decide to leave the city and search for Daenerys, Daario tells the other three to stay put, since Missandei, as Daenerys's closest confidante, will be needed to help Grey Worm and Tyrion run Meereen in the queen's absence.\n\nMissandei works with Tyrion, Grey Worm, and Varys to maintain the Queen's peace in the city. One day, whilst discussing Rhaegal and Viserion, Tyrion mentions that since they were used to Missandei's presence when they were younger, they would probably be comfortable around her now, should they be freed.\n\nWhilst Varys is dealing with Vala, Tyrion attempts to engage Missandei and Grey Worm in conversation. Neither of them are very good at small talk, however, and both are bewildered by his behavior. When Tyrion tries to engage them in a drinking game, Missandei says that neither of them drink.\n\nWhen Varys finally enters and rescues them from the conversation, Missandei cautions against immediate reprisals against Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, since they need their troops to protect Meereen. In a short speech Missandei states the Masters of Slaver's Bay only speak one \"language\" (violence and war), and they must speak it to these Masters, who have united to oppose Meereen. In the end, Tyrion convinces Varys to use his network of little birds to open communications with the cities' leaders.\n\nMissandei counsels Tyrion before and during his meeting with the Masters of the slave cities of Essos. When Tyrion states that he has experienced the horrors of slavery, Missandei is insulted considering he only experienced slavery for a very short time in comparison to her time as one; she states he does not understand. During the meeting, Missandei defends Daenerys' liberation of the slaves. She has a mixed response to Tyrion's compromise of a seven-year transition period, but reluctantly supports him in front of a delegation of former slaves. In private, she and Grey Worm argue that no matter what, Tyrion will become a pawn of the masters, as that is their way.\n\nMissandei, along with Grey Worm and Varys, are present when Tyrion holds a meeting with Kinvara, the High Priestess of the Red Temple at Volantis. To convince the Meereenese that everything is going befittingly with Daenerys' blessing, Tyrion secures an agreement with the Red Priestess to preach that Dany is The Prince That Was Promised.\n\nLater, Missandei and Grey Worm exchange wine and jokes at the Great Pyramid. While reluctant to drink, Missandei and Grey Worm do so in honor of their Queen. After Tyrion tells a joke about Westerosi lords in a bar, she tells a joke about two translators stranded at sea. While Tyrion feigns amusement, Grey Worm tells her that it was the worse joke he had ever heard.\n\nThe three friends then celebrate Grey Worm's new-found ability to tell a joke. Shortly later, they hear the sound of bombardment. Looking out the ramparts, they find a massive fleet sent by Astapor, Yunkai, and Pentos bombarding the city with trebuchets. Missandei remarks that the slave cities have returned for their \"property.\" By nightfall, Tyrion admits that his policy of diplomacy was a failure and allows Grey Worm to lead the city's defense. Shortly after, they hear movement on the roof and discover that Daenerys has returned by riding upon Drogon.\n\nThe following day, Missandei accompanies Grey Worm, Daenerys, and Tyrion during a meeting with representatives from the slavers' cities, including Belicho Paenymion, Razdal mo Eraz and Yezzan zo Qaggaz. In return for allowing Dany and Tyrion to leave unharmed, Razdal demands the return of the Unsullied and Missandei, whom he intends to sell as a slave to the highest bidder.\n\nHowever, Dany undoubtly rejects their offer and unleashes her dragons; Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal on the slavers' fleet. The Masters cower in fear as Missandei informs them their queen asks for at least one of their lives as payment for their crimes. Grey Worm executes Belicho and Razdalby slicing their throats, who were quick to offer the death of the third slaver. Yezzan zo Qaggaz is spared so that he can bring back word of Dany's power to the slave cities.\n\nWhen Daenerys finally sets sail to Westeros at the head of the combined Greyjoy, Martell, Meereenese and Tyrell armadas, Missandei joins her and Tyrion on the deck of the flagship. She stands alongside Varys, looking determined to play her continious loyal role in the next part of the game of thrones.\n\nMissandei arrives on Dragonstone, accompanied by Daenerys, Varys, Tyrion and Grey Worm. She follows Daenerys from the shore of the island to the hall of the castle. Knowing this is her defining moment, and coming home, Missandei stops Grey Worm from continuing into the Chamber of the Painted Table with Daenerys.\n\nAfter witnessing Tyrion's announcement that the Unsullied will attack Casterly Rock to seize it, that being Daenerys' first move in the upcoming war, on Daenerys' council, Missandei visits Grey Worm in his chambers, persuming that he will lead the attack. There they engage in a conversation in which Grey Worm tells her that all the Unsullied have to face their weaknesses, his only weakness being her. When she realizes what he wants, Missandei removes her clothes, but when she tries to remove his, too, he hesitates before letting her see his castration wounds. Then they start making love by him orally pleasuring her.\n\nMissandei, Tyrion, and several Dothraki including Qhono, greet the King in the North Jon Snow and his adviser Davos Seaworth on the shores of Dragonstone. After Tyrion and Jon exchange pleasantries, Missandei orders the Northmen to lay down their weapons; which they oblige. While walking up to the castle, Missandei talks with Davos, who takes an interest in her homeland of Naath. On the way, the group are startled by Queen Daenerys' dragons but Missandei and Tyrion maintain their composure.\n\nIn the throne room, Missandei introduces her Queen by her many titles. During the meeting, Dany demands that Jon Snow bend the knee and pledge fealty to her. Jon Snow is reluctant to bend the knee due to the historical animosity between the Starks and Targaryens dating back to the time of the Mad King. Jon Snow also warns Daenerys about the threat posed by the White Walkers and their undead armies. The two sides are unable to reach a common ground due to Jon Snow's reluctance to submit to Daenerys and Dany's skepticism of the existence of White Walkers and Wights. After receiving news from Varys that Yara's fleet has been attack, Dany adjourns the meeting and tasks Missandei with giving Jon Snow and his followers lodging and food for their stay.\n\nAfter learning that Euron's Iron Fleet has wiped out much of Yara's fleet, Missandei, Tyrion, and Varys attend a meeting with Queen Daenerys. When Daenerys proposed riding with her dragons to raze the Iron Fleet, Missandei and Tyrion argue against it because they do not have information on Euron's location and the fear that one stray arrow may kill Daenerys. Missandei is present when Tyrion briefs the council about the Unsullied's assault on the Lannister seat of King's Landing. Grey Worm leads a successful assault on the castle only to learn that the bulk of the Lannister forces have retreated and that they have stumbled into a trap consisting of Euron's Iron Fleet.\n\nDaenerys and Missandei heads down to the beach. Missandei is worried about Grey Worm because they haven't heard any news from Casterly Rock yet. Daenerys asks what happened between her and Grey Worm, and Missandei wryly says \"many things\", smiling. She then continues into the caves with Jon, Daenerys and Davos. Upon exit, they are informed of the events of the Sack of Highgarden and the Siege of Casterly Rock. Following the information, her queen decides on riding Drogon into battle, staging the events of the Battle of the Goldroad.\n\nDavos and Jon encounter Missandei as they wait for her queen to return, she politely enquires why Jon's surname is \"Snow\" even though House Stark has ruled the North for centuries, and his father Ned and brother Robb both had the surname \"Stark\" but he doesn't. Jon and Davos explain to her the special system regional surnames used in Westeros for bastard children of the nobility. Missandei doesn't know what they mean, so they literally explain that Jon's parents weren't married. Davos asks if they have similar customs for bastards on Naath. Quizzically, Missandei explains that \"Marriage\" as such does not exist in Naath, so she finds the idea of a \"bastard\" to be quite an alien concept. Davos says that sounds liberating. Jon then asks when she left, to which Missandei finally reveals that she was taken by slavers, to be freed only years later by Daenerys. When Davos suggests Missandei simply traded one master for another, she counters that she and all the freed slaves serve Daenerys because they choose to. Davos keeps pushing, asking what would happen if Missandei decided to return to Naath immediately. She responds that Daenerys would give her a ship and wish her good fortune.\n\nWhile Missandei, Davos and Jon are still on the causeway, they see a lone iron born ship approaching the island, a survivor of Yara Greyjoy's fleet. Theon Greyjoy himself and some of his men come to shore on a rowboat. As they disembarks, Theon and the ironborn encounter Jon while Missandei, Davos and a few Dothraki escort guards witness a confrontation between Jon and Theon when they both last saw each other before Jon was leaving Winterfell to join the Night's Watch.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Missandei"}}

He succeeded him after Galbart's death in the War of the Five Kings.\n\nJon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Davos Seaworth secretly meet with Robett to try and gain his support against House Bolton. He refuses to help, as they have only secured the loyalty of House Mormont, and citing that Jon Snow has joined forces with wildlings, whereas the Boltons helped Robett take Deepwood Motte back from the Ironborn, who had captured it and terrorized Robett's family and subjects. He lambastes Robb Stark, to whom House Glover was sworn, for giving no such help (though in all irony, this was Robb's original intention, but he was persuaded otherwise by Roose Bolton) and \"taking up with a foreign whore\", ruining his political alliances, thus costing the North the entire war and getting all of his men killed along with him at the Red Wedding. Despite the protestations of Jon and Sansa, Robett refuses to declare for them, and sends them away empty-handed.\n\nRobett, along with other Northern lords, travels to Winterfell following the defeat of the Boltons at the Battle of the Bastards, where he and two other lords, Wyman Manderly and Cley Cerwyn, are berated by Lady Lyanna Mormont for refusing to help the Stark cause. Robett is the second lord, after Lord Wyman, to declare Jon King in the North. He apologizes for not participating in the battle, and pledges his allegiance to House Stark and Jon Snow.\n\nAlong with the rest of the lords of the North and the Vale, Glover meets with the King in the North to plan for the coming war against the White Walkers. When Jon states that all Northerners will be conscripted, Glover initially objects to the idea of women being trained for warfare but comes around to the idea after Lyanna Mormont explains her support. He supports Jon's decision on pardoning Alys Karstark and Ned Umber.\n\nHe is later present when Jon convenes another meeting at Winterfell. There, Robett reads Samwell Tarly's letter regarding the vast amount of dragonglass and is informed of Daenerys Targaryen's letter regarding the fact that it would be wise if Jon would bend the knee. Despite the wishes of Robett and other noble lords, Jon still departs Winterfell, leaving Sansa in control of the North.\n\nWhile Jon Snow is preoccupied on Dragonstone with Daenerys and mining the dragon glass, Lord Glover and Lord Yohn Royce propose that the Regent Sansa take over as ruler of the North. Sansa rejects their proposal and stresses that she is only a Regent. Sansa's younger sister Arya Stark then suggests killing the troublesome lords but is rebuffed by Sansa. Arya later observes Lord Glover speaking with Lords Royce and Baelish, prompting her to suspect that Littlefinger is plotting to overthrow Jon.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Robett_Glover"}}

Rhaegar was killed by Robert Baratheon, who was Lyanna's betrothed, at the Battle of the Trident.

However, in his hubris Oberyn is unexpectedly caught off guard when the Mountain suddenly trips him up. Berserk with fury at nearly being killed by his opponent, the Mountain pins Oberyn to the ground and proceeds to gouge out his eyeballs, making him scream in agony, as he roars for all to hear, \"Elia Martell!

Along with Ellaria Sand, the paramour of her father, and her half-sisters Nymeria Sand and Tyene Sand, she takes part in the Coup in Dorne, during which they seize power in Dorne from the legitimate House Martell. She is killed by Euron Greyjoy when he ambushes the Iron Fleet on its way to Sunspear.","Obara is the Sand Snake most like their father. He taught her the ways of war himself, training her in the use of a traditional Dornish spear like he used. Unlike most Dornishmen, who are overtly passionate, Obara is staunchly disciplined to not overtly display her emotions. This is largely due to her origins: unlike her sisters Nymeria and Tyene, Obara's mother was not a noblewoman, so when Oberyn came to take her to court, she had to choose between staying or going, the latter meaning she would never see her mother again. As a result, she has a cold and hardened demeanor, and cares very little for her family. This is not to say that Obara is the most rational of the sisters (Nymeria is the most rational and calculating one). She is actually quite irrational and ruled by her emotions, she just doesn't outwardly show them that much. The difference is that in a situation where Tyene would aggressively shout insults at an enemy and attack them, Obara would just silently walk straight up to them and stab them without saying a word. Nymeria, in contrast, would hold back and attempt to assess if there would be a more opportune moment to strike at a later time.","Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister while the two discuss Cersei's own illegitimate daughter Myrcella Baratheon, who has been sent to Dorne.","Obara, her sisters, and Ellaria gather on the docks to see Jaime, Myrcella, and Trystane off; Obara is dressed in robes that are remarkably similar to her father's. When the poison Ellaria used on Myrcella begins to affect her as well, Ellaria quaffs the antidote, while Obara seems pleased.","Ellaria dispatches Obara and her sister Nymeria to King's Landing with the intention of killing Prince Trystane, which Obara obeys with no objection. The sisters ambush the young prince aboard his ship, Obara telling him of their intentions, and laughing at him when he attempts to reason with them since they are family. Though Trystane chooses to fight Nymeria first, Obara kills him by stabbing him through the back of the head with her spear, and smiles at his bloody corpse.","After Daenerys and her fleet arrive at Dragonstone, The Dragon Queen and her hand, Tyrion Lannister, decide to send the Martell and Greyjoy fleets to Sunspear in order to stage a joint attack on King's Landing together along with House Tyrell. Obara accompanies Ellaria, Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and her sisters on the journey. Below the deck of their ship, Obara and Nymeria playfully tease Tyene. After they are ambushed by Euron Greyjoy and his fleet, both Obara and Nymeria confront Euron while Tyene protects Ellaria. As Obara spars the Lord Reaper of the Iron Islands with her spear, Nymeria attacks him with her whip. Despite Obara wounding him in the side, Euron proves to be a more skillful fighter and ultimately stabs her in the stomach with her own spear. She is impaled at the front of the ship with her spear, next to her hanging sister, Nymeria. Theon sees both of their corpses as he floats aimlessly on the water.","Obara is still alive so far in the books."],"name":"Obara Sand","description":"Though staunchly loyal to her people and the future of Dorne, Obara is a formidable and somewhat ruthless warrior, exhibiting several traits that suggest that not only can she defeat the worthiest of opponents, but she enjoys watching them suffer for a while before finishing them off, whether or not her adversary has a chance to defend themselves. Of the Sand Snakes, Obara appears to be the least emotional, as she is frequently seen meditating or sleeping while her sisters bicker, to the point of being almost machine-like in nature.\n\nFollowing the death of Oberyn (or maybe even before then), Obara becomes a vengeful person and willingly goes along with Ellaria Sand's plot to kill Myrcella Baratheon and plunge Dorne into war with the Lannisters, completely ignoring the fact that Myrcella is an innocent girl who had nothing to do with Oberyn's death, and that thousands of people will die as a result of these actions (though it is mentioned that the Dornish are willing to go to war for Oberyn anyway). Though Obara does not share the same evil and psychopathic traits as kinslayers such as Ramsay Bolton, she is shown to be a very dirty fighter if the situation calls for it. Her lack of emotions prevents her from objecting to Ellaria's plan to assassinate both Doran and Trystane, who are Obara's uncle and cousin by blood; instead, while ambushing Trystane, Obara and Nymeria make a joke out of it by arguing over who will kill him, and though Trystane attempts to reason with them, Obara merely laughs, and while Trystane's back is turned, she literally stabs him in the back, watching him bleed out with obvious satisfaction, indifferent to the fact that she has just committed kinslaying, considered to be one of the worst crimes in all of Westeros, particularly against a defenceless and innocent target. Her actions in the sixth season overall suggest that Obara is incapable of feeling love or any emotion whatsoever, given that even though it appeared that her desire was to avenge Oberyn, she insulted Oberyn's memory by murdering his brother and nephew. This hints that instead, Obara is indifferent to committing cold-blooded murder; she does it just for her own amusement, such as with the merchant captain, Myrcella and Trystane.\n\nHer violent streak, however, is also her weakness, shown when the Greyjoy fleet comes under attack by Euron Greyjoy and she rushes into the battle. Unaware of Euron Greyjoy's fearsome reputation, Obara fights the pirate captain, underestimating Euron and ending up killed by him, ironically by her own weapon.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Obara_Sand"}}

His father, Ludd, stood up for him however, saying, \"A Whitehill is a Whitehill\", even if he was fourth born. He grew into an aggressive, pushy man who desires to rule a castle of his own, and takes much pleasure in usurping control of Ironrath and humiliating Rodrik, its legitimate lord.\". He is described by Duncan Tuttle as being a \"fourthborn son with something to prove\".\n\nAt the time after the Red Wedding, Gryff was at Harrenhal.\n\nWhen Ramsay Snow states that a garrison of Whitehill men will be stationed in Ironrath depending on how Lord Ethan responds Ramsay will ask Ludd Whitehill if he has someone he can trust to lead the garrison, Ludd confirms this and states that his son Gryff will lead it.\n\nLord Whitehill bursts in on Rodrik Forrester and explains that his son Gryff is on his way from Harrenhal to meet up with the Whitehill's garrison at Ironrath. He will lead them to ensure the Forresters stay in line. It is also mentioned that Gryff is the fourth born son of Ludd Whitehill.\n\nGryff appears in person in this episode. The Whitehill soldiers occupying Ironrath begin to assemble in the court yard and set a tent on fire. Gryff then shows himself to the annoyed Rodrik Forrester and declares control of Ironrath despite resistance from Rodrik and Elissa. He then demands residence in the Great Hall forcing Rodrik to comply.\n\nLater a Whitehill guard is bit by Talia and Gryff demands justice from Rodrik. When Rodrik grabs and defends Talia he is pushed to the ground by Gryff continuously and demands that he stays down threatening him saying that Talia will meet the same fate as Ethan.\n\nAs Ironrath is still occupied by Whitehill soldiers. Lord Glenmore agreed to wed Gryff to his daughter Elaena Glenmore. However Elaena disagrees with the forced marriage and seeks out Rodriks help. It is agreed that Rodrik will kill Gryff Whitehill with the help of Arthur Glenmore's elite men. Rodrik then confronts Gryff as he is 'punishing' the maester for 'letting the bite wound fester.' Rodrik stands up to Gryff and confronts him, after a small brawl the Glenmore men march in and take hold of the Whitehill soldiers. The player is given the option to simply imprison Gryff, or beat him with increasing amounts of severity before Elissa steps in and stops Rodrik from killing Gryff, lest the Whitehills take vengeance on Ryon. At this point the player can choose to send Gryff to the dungeons or alternatively spit on him, or knock him out before having him sent to the dungeons. If Gryff is maimed but not knocked out, he will groan that he cannot see meaning Rodrik possibly blinded Gryff's left eye. He is then dragged to the cellars.\n\nGryff remains imprisoned during Ramsay Snow's visit to Ironrath. However, he is later freed by the traitor.\n\nGryff later leads the Whitehill ambush of Asher Forrester's hired pit fighters as the arrive in Westeros. After Asher and Rodrik are trapped in the port town, Gryff rides up on horseback, commanding the attack. He looks on smugly as either Asher or Rodrik remains behind and is slain by his soldiers.\n\nIf Asher survives the Ambush at the Harbor, Gryff orders his troops to pursue Asher and make a second attempt at killing him, however Asher's counter-attack wipes out Gryff's soldiers, alarming Ludd sufficiently to seek peace with the new Lord Forrester. Ludd arrives at Ironrath with Gryff to offer terms, where Gryff mocks Asher. Gryff returns with the rest of House Whitehill for the White Engagement at Ironrath to celebrate the new peace agreement, where he proceeds to taunt Asher over his time in Essos as a sellsword. If Asher chose to ambush the Whitehills or make peace, Gryff attacks Asher but is slain in the battle after being stabbed and thrown in a roaring fire pit. If Ludd was poisoned, Gryff is bested and disarmed by Asher, however before Asher can deliver the killing blow, Gwyn stabs Asher in the back, allowing Gryff to flee and rally the rest of the Whitehill army and seize Ironrath. Gryff is later seen marching into Ironrath at the head of his army.\n\nIf Rodrik survives the Ambush at the Harbor, Gryff appears, alongside Lord Whitehill, leading the Whitehill army towards Ironrath. During Rodrik's raid on the Whitehill camp, Gryff is seen conversing with Ludd and remarks that he will cut off Ryon's legs so he will not be able to escape. Ludd also gives additional orders to kill Ryon if he was to die under any circumstances. If targeted, Gryff is seen abusing Ryon until he is confronted and stabbed in the lungs by Rodrik. Upon his defeat, Gryff begins to whimper and pleads to Rodrik for mercy, in which Rodrik can either behead him or let him bleed out while taunting him for being a coward. If Ludd was killed instead, Gryff is later seen entering Ironrath and leading the assault on the castle.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gryff_Whitehill"}}

The Iron Fleet was later defeated by the forces of Lord Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of Fair Isle. Following the Siege of Pyke, the Ironborn ruler Balon Greyjoy sues for peace and submits to King Robert Baratheon. His youngest son and heir Theon Greyjoy is sent to live as a ward of Lord Eddard Stark.\n\nAt the Kingsmoot held after the death of Balon, Yara vows to build the \"mightiest fleet\" to conquer the mainland. However, she is outmaneuvered by her uncle Euron, who advocates forging an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen in order to gain access to her dragons. While Euron is being baptized by Aeron Greyjoy, Yara, Theon, and their supporters flee on the best ships in the Iron Fleet. In response, Euron orders his supporters to build another fleet and to kill his niece and nephew.\n\nYara and Theon's Iron Fleet sails to Essos with the intention of beating Euron to Dany, who lives in Meereen in Slaver's Bay. On the way, they stop for rest and relaxation at the Free City of Volantis. At Meereen, Yara and Theon forge an alliance with Daenerys and her advisor Tyrion Lannister. In return for recognizing the independence of the Iron Islands and helping them to overthrow Euron, Yara agrees to ferry Dany's army to Westeros and to cease raiding the mainland. Later, the Iron Fleet is seen sailing as part of a combined Targaryen armada to invade Westeros.\n\nAfter Yara and Theon abscond with their best ships, Euron considers his remaining bulk of the Iron Islands' naval forces to be the real \"Iron Fleet\" and refers to it as such (comparable to how both Joffrey Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon considered their own fleets to be the \"Royal Fleet\" when they faced each other).\n\nAfter Cersei Lannister declares herself queen, Euron arrives in King's Landing to offer her a marriage-alliance and his Iron Fleet. Given that Cersei has personally alienated the North, Dorne, and the Reach with blood betrayals, Euron is the only major faction left who would be willing to ally with her - and given that Yara's faction sided with Daenerys, who has allied with Cersei's younger brother Tyrion Lannister (who killed their father), Euron claims that this makes Cersei his natural ally. Cersei remains unconvinced of his trustworthiness, given that Euron killed his own brother to seize rule of the Iron Islands. He sees her point, and departs offering that he will return with a great gift to prove his worth.\n\nThe Iron Fleet, under Euron's command and having just left King's Landing, attacks a portion of the Targaryen fleet under Yara's command as it leaves Dragonstone heading to Dorne. Euron's ships launch fireballs into Yara's, crippling the Targaryen fleet and giving naval superiority to the Iron Fleet.\n\nThe Iron Fleet returns to King's Landing where Euron parades his captives through the streets - to the amusement of the citizens. Euron delivers Ellaria and Tyene to Cersei, fulfilling his promise of a gift by handing her the people responsible for the death of her daughter Myrcella. Cersei is pleased and, in turn, promises to grant his request of marriage after the war is won. Euron then steps away from the Iron Throne towards Jaime, deliberately provoking him about the fact that Cersei is going to marry him. Euron is eventually ordered to set sail again and leads the Iron Fleet west to Casterly Rock where he attacks and destroys the remainders of Daenerys' fleet who are besieging the Rock.\n\nWhen Euron and Cersei take part in the parley in King's Landing, the entire Iron Fleet docked in Blackwater Bay. After Euron witnesses a wight firsthand, he claims to be leaving in fear and taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands. However, Euron secretly takes the Iron Fleet to Essos under Cersei's orders, with the intent of transporting the Golden Company to Westeros to fight for Cersei.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Iron_Fleet"}}

He is charged with keeping peace and order in the city and quelling unrest.","Janos reports to the small council about the disruptions to the city caused by the tournament to celebrate Lord Eddard Stark's appointment. Lord Renly Baratheon suggests dismissing Janos in favor of someone more competent, but Janos angrily replies he doesn't have enough resources. Eddard offers him twenty of his household guard and commands Littlefinger to find gold to pay for an expansion of the City Watch by another fifty men.","Lord Janos has been given a place in the small council. During a session that coincides with King Joffrey Baratheon's sixteenth nameday and the official announcement of the end of the longest summer in living memory, he expresses his concern with the influx of refugees fleeing the civil war. He is ordered by Queen Regent Cersei Lannister to bar the city gates to peasants. Later, Janos oversees the massacre of all of the late King Robert Baratheon's bastard children. He personally murders the baby Barra before the eyes of her mother Mhaegen, one of Littlefinger's prostitutes. He also interrogates Tobho Mott, who is being tortured by one of the gold cloaks, about the whereabouts of Gendry and learns that he has left to join the Night's Watch and is heading to Castle Black. Janos sends a small party of men after Gendry.","Much to his disappointment, Jon survives and returns to Castle Black. Janos is later present when Jon urges the Night's Watch to seal Castle Black's tunnel because of Mance Rayder's superior forces.","During a meeting, as Jon assigns missions to various black brothers, Janos pats Thorne on the shoulder when Jon names him First Ranger. When Jon assigns Janos to take command of the castle of Greyguard, he rudely refuses before Jon is even finished speaking. The Lord Commander clarifies that this is official command, not an offer, but Janos further insults Jon, telling him that he can \"stick [his] order up [his] bastard arse.\" Calmly, Jon orders Janos to be taken outside and calls for his sword. At first, Janos is dragged out to the courtyard believing that this is simply a scare tactic, but he realizes his mistake when Eddison Tollett forces him down onto the chopping block. Terrified, Janos begs for Jon to give him another chance, admitting that he was wrong to question him and that he has been afraid for a long time, and breaks into tears. His pleas for mercy are ultimately futile and Jon beheads Janos with Longclaw - exacting a small justice for the deceased Ned Stark, as well as the Stark guardsmen who were slaughtered in the throne room, and King Robert's murdered bastard children.","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Janos Slynt was a commoner, a butcher's son, who joined the City Watch and rose through the ranks first to captain of the Iron Gate and then to become its commander at the death of the former commander, Manly Stokeworth. The City Watch, or \"Gold Cloaks\", is one of the few institutions in Westeros to permit promotion of non-nobles from the ranks. He is a somewhat humorless man who is arrogant and proud of his achievements. He is bald, stout, and heavily jowled, often described as frog-faced and shaped like a keg. He is the father of Morros, Jothos, Danos, and a daughter."],"name":"Janos Slynt","description":"Janos Slynt was a disgraceful, arrogant and corrupt man who would commit any action given to him by the king or queen, without hesitation, without remorse and without honor. While he claims to be a loyal and faithful servant of the King and his main priority would be to defend the city and serve the king; Janos's true drive appears to be to obtain power through political positions and abuse such power to dominate his command over others by the use of immoral and cruel means, and later defend such actions by stating they were justified in the name of the king or otherwise. Amongst other things he accepts solicited bribes from criminals and other members of the City Watch.\n\nJanos naturally enjoys authoritative positions, having found himself in them his entire life, including Lord Commander of the City Watch, member of the Small Council, head of House Slynt and an unspecified high-ranking position in the Night's Watch. However this is more of a compliment to his ability to squirm his way into the favor of other people with high-ranking positions by blind obedience and being outwardly sycophantic rather than his own accommodations.\n\nJanos is not above treachery or hypocrisy at times. He would never have risked his position by doing the honorable thing and helping Eddard Stark remove Joffrey Baratheon from power, instead he betrays Eddard and his men on the spot and defends this to Tyrion Lannister by saying he was a traitor who attempted to buy him off, ignoring that he was already bought off by Petyr Baelish in the first place. A common mistake Janos usually makes is believing himself an important or valued necessity, whilst he is usually disregarded altogether. When being exiled to the Night's Watch, he proclaims he has \"powerful friends\" who would be upset about this but in reality no one appeared concerned over Janos's exile. He uses this excuse again when about to be executed, unaware that Tywin Lannister was dead and he was making empty threats. Finally, when Jon Snow gives the order of Janos's executions, he stands staunchly as Alliser Thorne seemingly defends him, only to be shocked when Thorne moves aside and lets them have their way with him.\n\nBeneath his confident and defiant exterior, Janos is actually a coward. While other Lord Commanders of the City Watch are either knights or have some knowledge of the battlefield, he possesses none of the sort and prefers attacking those who cannot fight back, including Lord Eddard's defenseless soldiers in the Throne Room and Barra, one of Robert's bastards who was only a baby. His cowardice is displayed during the Battle of Castle Black where he hides with the women and children and, when finally realizing Jon was serious about executing him, breaks down in tears, begging and claiming, \"I've always been afraid.\"\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Janos_Slynt"}}

When Drogo agrees to Daenerys' request, Mago challenges Drogo to single combat. Drogo kills Mago, but takes a minor arakh wound to his chest.

Duur claims that she can save him, but requires a blood sacrifice. She suggests killing Drogo's horse. Qotho becomes enraged at her use of magic to save Drogo and tries to stop the ceremony, but is killed by Ser Jorah Mormont.

She finds Drogo alive but in a vegetative state. Daenerys asks desperately when will Drogo be as he was, and Duur answers: \"When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east, when the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves\". Duur explains that Daenerys got what she traded for, and that before she was \"saved\" by Daenerys, she had already been raped several times and her temple had been burned.

Writer's assistant Dave Hill (who wrote the \"Histories & Lore\" animated featurettes on the Blu-ray releases for the second, third and fourth seasons) suggested to Benioff and Weiss that Olly join the Night's Watch, because he had nowhere else to go, and to kill Ygritte during the Battle of Castle Black for dramatic sense (in the books, Jon finds Ygritte after she has already been shot, and it is never revealed who fired the arrow that killed her, though Jon briefly believes it was one of his). Benioff and Weiss were so impressed with this suggestion that they promoted Hill to write an episode script in Season 5 (he wrote \"Sons of the Harpy\"), where Olly gained more prominence by becoming Jon Snow's personal steward and later dealing the final blow to Jon in the mutiny at Castle Black, and in Season 6 (\"Home\"), where Jon Snow returns from the dead and later has Olly hanged.","Three quarters of the inhabitants of Mole's Town flee to Castle Black after Jon Snow warns them of the wildling raiding parties.

After the attack of the Thenns is repelled, many of the villagers think that the worst is behind and return to the village. A few residents from Mole's Town decide to stay rather than risk going back to the weakly defended lands to the south, among them: Zei the whore, Hareth (aka Horse) the stablehand and three young orphans (nine, eight and five years old) whose father was killed on the steps. Olly is perhaps loosely based on those orphans, though it is not mentioned whether they take active part in the battle and what becomes of them later.

The warg brings him to Styr, who holds a blade to his throat. Styr tells Olly that he is going to eat his dead parents, and orders him to tell the men of the Night's Watch at Castle Black in an attempt to draw them out into the open. He then releases Olly, who reaches Castle Black and informs the men of the approaching wildlings.\n\nOlly stays at Castle Black, living amongst the brothers of the Night's Watch and wearing the black clothes of the Night's Watch. He later trains with them for the upcoming fight against the wildlings. Olly brags to the brothers about his archery skills, though only Grenn says he believes him, as well as promising to take him hunting soon.\n\nOlly greets Jon Snow, Grenn and Eddison Tollett as they return to Castle Black after coming from Craster's Keep. Jon pats him on the head as he greets the brothers. During the Battle of Castle Black, Olly is assigned to work the wooden lift system. As the battle rages on Samwell Tarly urges him to pick up a weapon and defend himself. Olly then spots Ygritte preparing to kill Jon Snow. Before she can shoot Jon, Olly uses a bow to kill Ygritte with an arrow through the heart, avenging his father in the process. After the arrival of Stannis Baratheon and his forces, Olly is among the black brothers that attend when the fallen brothers are burned in Castle Black's courtyard.\n\nOlly remains at Castle Black and spars with Jon Snow in the training yard, alongside other new recruits. He has little experience with a sword and shield, but Jon does his best to teach Olly how to be a proper swordsman. Olly abruptly stops sparring when Melisandre arrives to fetch Jon. Later, Olly is present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee.\n\nOlly is present at the choosing for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and is happy when Jon Snow defeats Ser Alliser Thorne for the position of Lord Commander.\n\nJon later names Olly as his personal steward, grooming him for command as Jeor Mormont once did for him.

Olly is later at a meeting of Night's Watch where Janos Slynt refuses to man and repair Greyguard, a ruined castle on the Wall. Jon orders Slynt to be brought outside and orders Olly to bring him Longclaw. Olly gives Jon his sword and witnesses Slynt's execution.\n\nHowever, Olly's trust in Jon begins to sour after Jon makes the suggestion of allowing the wildlings to pass through the Wall and become subjects of the Seven Kingdoms or even members of the Night's Watch so as to avoid them falling into the coming White Walker army. First Steward Bowen Marsh points out what the wildlings did to Olly's family and friends in the Gift while in Mance Rayder's army. Later, in Jon's office, Olly asks if Jon means to lure the wildlings into a trap, but Jon denies it, reminding Olly that despite the losses they have suffered at the wildlings' hands, they will need all the help they can get if the Night's Watch is to stand a chance against the White Walkers.\n\nLater, Olly visits Sam in his rooms, ostensibly to offer him some food. However, he wants to ask Sam why Jon would want to join forces with the Wildlings, particularly Tormund, who led the raid in which his parents were killed. Sam reassures Olly that Jon knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the Night's Watch nor Westeros stands a chance against the White Walkers. Sam explains this is a hard choice Jon had to make, however unpopular, and then then tells him not to worry, as Jon always comes back.\n\nWhen Jon Snow returns from Hardhome with thousands of wildlings and lets them in through the Wall, Olly is among the many black brothers who look at the wildlings and even their Lord Commander with disgust.

Jon quickly rushes out of the room, across the courtyard and past a group of Night's Watchmen, only to find a sign with the word \"Traitor\" scrawled upon it. Several Night's Watchmen mutiny against Jon and stab him, bringing him to his knees, and Olly approaches. Jon whispers Olly's name as a plea for mercy. With tears in his eyes, Olly finishes Jon off by stabbing him through the heart, ending the mutiny and leaving his Lord Commander dead in the snow.\n\nOlly is present in the dining room of Castle Black when Thorne announces Jon's murder at their hands and gives his justification to sway most of the Watch to his side. He witnesses Thorne issue Davos Seaworth and the brothers loyal to Jon his ultimatum to surrender or die.\n\nLater, Olly is present as the mutineers attempt to break into the room where Jon's body is. Before they could break in, however, Edd returns with Tormund Giantsbane and an army of wildlings. Though Thorne demands that the watchmen stand and fight, they are intimidated into surrender by the giant, Wun Wun. Olly then charges Tormund (likely due to his involvement in the attack on Olly's village), but is quickly overpowered and disarmed. Olly is then led away to the Ice Cells along with Thorne and the rest of the mutineers.  After Jon Snow's resurrection and subsequent reclamation of command, Olly is led to the gallows to be publicly hanged for treason. As Jon asks his condemned murderers for their last words, Olly refuses to speak and instead glares furiously at Jon. After a moment of silence from Jon, Olly gives him one final look of hatred before he is hanged along with the others.\n\nDespite Olly having literally stabbed him in the heart, Jon continues to be plagued by guilt for executing him, as he was a boy even younger than Jon's \"brother\" Bran Stark.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olly"}}

House Stark rule the region from their seat of Winterfell and Rickard also held the title Lord of Winterfell.\n\nBenjen is the younger brother of Brandon, Eddard and Lyanna. Rickard, Brandon and Lyanna were all killed in the civil war known as Robert's Rebellion. Eddard inherited his father's titles and responsibilities.\n\nHe later attended the The Great Tourney at Harrenhal with his siblings.\n\nBenjen joined the Night's Watch, the military force which patrols the Wall and guards the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms. He earned the rank of First Ranger. Benjen is a hero to Eddard's \"bastard son\" Jon Snow.\n\nBenjen travels south from the Wall to join in the feast welcoming King Robert Baratheon to Winterfell. He brings news about ill omens from beyond the Wall. Benjen tells Eddard that the young deserter he executed was a good and loyal man, a true ranger who would not desert his post lightly. He invites his nephew Jon Snow to join the Night's Watch; Jon agrees despite Benjen's warning that it is a hard life. Eddard agrees to become the Hand of the King. A few days later, the royal party heads south. Benjen accompanies them to the Kingsroad and then escorts Jon and Tyrion Lannister north to Castle Black. Along the way they are joined by fresh recruits, including a rapist named Rast. Jon begins to realize that the Watch may not be the noble institution he thought it was.\n\nUpon arriving at Castle Black Jon begins his training. Benjen tells Jon that he is going north of the Wall on a ranging. Jon asks to go with him, but Benjen tells him that he is not ready and cautions that on the Wall a man only gets what he earns, not what his birth entitles him to.\n\nBenjen says farewell to his friend Yoren, a recruiter for the Watch. He also exchanges words with Tyrion, who is about to head south with Yoren. Benjen feels that Tyrion holds the Watch in disregard despite Tyrion's protests to the contrary.\n\nCatelyn Stark takes Tyrion prisoner at the Crossroads Inn believing he attempted to kill her son, Bran. Because of his friendship with Benjen, Yoren rides on to King's Landing and reports Catelyn's actions to Eddard.\n\nBenjen's horse returns to Castle Black, but there is no sign of Benjen himself. Shortly afterwards, two of the rangers who accompanied Benjen, Othor and Jafer Flowers, are found dead in the forest beyond the Wall. They are brought back to Castle Black for Maester Aemon to study, but in the middle of the night they reanimate as wights. Both are killed again and their bodies are burned. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont vows to take the Watch beyond the Wall in force to investigate what's going on and promises Jon that they will find Benjen alive or dead.\n\nAs the travel beyond the Wall in search, Mormont and his men stop at Craster's Keep where Mormont tells the wildling Craster that Benjen has said he planned to stop there on his way to the Frostfangs. Craster gruffly replies that he hasn't seen Benjen for three years and hasn't missed him, saying that Benjen \"always treated me like scum.\"\n\nJon, who has now been elected the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, ends up alienating many of his fellow black brothers when he brings back several thousand Wildlings that were driven away from Hardhome and allows them safe passage through Castle Black. His personal steward, Olly, lures him into a trap by claiming one of the Wildlings that he brought back says he knows Benjen. As Jon walks outside to see if this is true, Alliser Thorne (who Jon has since named First Ranger in place of the missing Benjen) adds that this Wildling claims he saw Benjen at Hardhome on the last full moon. However, this is revealed to be nothing but a farce as Alliser, Olly, and four other black brothers proceed to fatally stab Jon.\n\nBenjen appears in a vision experienced by Bran Stark. Benjen is shown training with Ned under a young Rodrik Cassel in the courtyard of Winterfell, though his skills are far inferior to Ned's. Lyanna appears and playfully teases Benjen about not having a sparring partner after Ned goes to the Eyrie, and suggests that Hodor, then known as Wylis, take up swordplay. Benjen almost has a match with Hodor, who is led away by Old Nan.\n\nBenjen is seen later in another of Bran's visions saying goodbye to Ned shortly before the latter heads off to the Vale. In another, he witnesses Hodor's seizure that renders him unable to speak properly other than the word \"Hodor\", but he is held back by Rodrik.\n\nBeyond the Wall, when Bran and Meera Reed are being chased by an army of wights, a hooded figure with a concealed face arrives atop a horse, wielding a flaming chain, to burn the wights and rescue the pair. When the wights become too numerous to fight off, he pulls Bran and Meera onto his horse and rides away. The next day, the hooded man feeds Bran the blood of a dead rabbit, and says he arrived to help because the three-eyed raven requested it.\n\nWhen questioned on his identity, he pulls down his scarf and hood, revealing himself as Benjen Stark. Benjen explains that, during his fateful ranging beyond the wall, he was attacked by White Walkers, one of whom shoved an ice sword into his gut and left him for dead. He was discovered by the Children of the Forest, who saved him and stopped him from becoming a wight by shoving a piece of dragonglass into his chest.\n\nBenjen eventually escorts Bran and Meera to the weirwood tree nearby the Wall. When asked by Meera why he cannot travel any further south, Benjen explains that ancient spells carved into the foundation of the Wall prevent the dead from passing through it. Benjen says he will continue to fight for the living as long as he can, before departing.\n\nWhen Jon, who has been left beyond the Wall by his group, is about to be swarmed by the army of the undead, Benjen suddenly comes riding in in the last moments, slaying wights from his horse. When he stops in front of Jon, he jumps off his horse and removes the scarf from his head, revealing his survival to the stunned Jon. To save Jon, Benjen heaves him onto his horse and orders him to ride back to the Wall. Jon asks Benjen to come with him but Benjen refuses, instead sending off the horse and drawing his flaming morningstar to make his final stand. As the wights swarm him, Benjen fights back but is eventually overwhelmed and killed by the army of the dead.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Benjen_Stark"}}

Like most honourable men, Barristan held some mistrust towards the Kingslayer, Jaime Lannister; although the two men had mutual respect for each others' skills, Barristan still saw his murder of Aerys as a very dishonorable act, and although he did not treat him with open contempt, he believed it would be dishonorable to reward Jaime with command of the Kingsguard after what he had done.\n\nHowever, Barristan's dutiful personality put him at odds that he could be too honorable at times. As a knight does not question or go against the wishes of his King, no matter what the King has or will do, with the Mad King, he could only watch as Aerys burnt innocent people alive and do nothing about it due to the oath he had sworn. While this exemplified the fact that he was an extremely honorable man, it also marred his conscience for the rest of his life. He served Robert Baratheon faithfully on the basis that Robert was more or less a fundamentally good man, even though he was also an extremely ineffective King. However, when Joffrey relinquished him entirely, Barristan vowed to serve under a king who he was proud to serve and believed in. His loyalty to his monarch was such that he was verbally incredulous when Cersei tore up Robert's final decree, stating that they were the King's words.\n\nBarristan was also a deep supporter of House Targaryen. Though he was horrified regarding the acts that Aerys committed, he still fought to retain the Targaryen Dynasty during the Sack of King's Landing and was close with Rheagar, Aerys' son whom he bodyguarded. Though he served under the man who killed Rheagar and stole Aerys' throne, he continued to support the Targaryens and finally assisted the Mad King's last living heir, Daenerys in helping her seize her birthright. Ser Barristan Selmy was extremely brave, being completely able to confront a ring of Sons of the Harpy with only a sword and no armour, while his faceless opponents had the advantage of armoured faces, numbers and weapons. Barristan fought incredibly well for a man of his age, cutting down a great number of the Sons without even crossing swords twice, even continuing after he was severely wounded and disoriented - what is fitting is that one of the greatest warriors that the Seven Kingdoms knew died the way he always wanted to, fighting against the forces of a malevolent and dangerous enemy with a sword in hand.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Barristan_Selmy"}}

The human wildlings simply took to informally calling Mag the \"king of the giants\" because the other giants seem to follow him.

Mance refers to him as the \"king\" of the giants, last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years to before the arrival of the First Men in Westeros.\n\nDuring the Battle of Castle Black, Mag approaches the Wall on the back of a mammoth. He rides up to the front gate and dismounts, at which point he and Dongo take the mammoth and turn it around while several wildlings tie ropes to it, then they tie the other end of the ropes to the gate's supports. While the mammoth tries to pull the gate open, men of the Night's Watch throw down flaming barrels of tar, which explode and drive the mammoth off. Dongo attempts to chase after it, but this brings him within the firing arc of a large ballista mounted atop the Wall. The ballista bolt impales him from behind and he is killed.\n\nMag is enraged at the death of his fellow giant and bellows out a fearsome cry. His already incredible strength swelled with anger, Mag manages to lift the massive gate with his bare hands. He succeeds in passing underneath, though it slides closed again when he releases it. Mag then charges through the icy tunnel to the portcullis in the middle. Grenn, Donnel Hill, Cooper, and three others are waiting for him and terrified, but Grenn rallies his men by leading them in reciting the oath of the Night's Watch, finishing just as Mag collides with the gate.\n\nAfter the battle ends, Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly find Mag's body in the tunnel beneath the Wall, along with those of the men he fought, who successfully held the gate at the cost of their own lives.\n\nWhen Jon treats with Mance in the wildling camp, Mance asks what happened to the giant who managed to get inside the gate, but who never came out. Jon explains that he died, killing six black brothers including Jon's friend Grenn. Saddened, Mance tells Jon that the giant's name was Mag the Mighty, the giants' king - the last of a bloodline which stretched back to long before the arrival of the First Men in Westeros.

He and Tyrion travel to Meereen, joining Daenerys's Small Council. After assisting Tyrion, Grey Worm and Missandei with the rule of Meereen in their Queen's name, Varys returns to Westeros and rallies House Tyrell of the Reach, and the Sand Snakes of Dorne for Daenerys's cause against House Lannister.  ","He is known as \"The Spider\" due to his vast web of intelligence sources. His sophisticated intelligence network - one of the largest in the world - spans both Westeros and Essos, as far as Vaes Dothrak and even Qarth. He refers to his agents and sources of information, many of which are low-born children, as his \"little birds\". Unlike Baelish, however, Varys is not indifferent or cruel towards his employees; he educates them, gives them sweets and provides them with protection in return for the information they bring him.","Varys meets with Eddard Stark and frankly tells him that King Robert is a fool and likely doomed unless Eddard can save him. He confirms that Jon Arryn was murdered with a poison called the Tears of Lys and implicates the deceased Ser Hugh of the Vale in the murder, though he is unable to pinpoint who ordered the killing. He claims to be a man of honor, like Eddard, who only wants to keep the realm stable and at peace.","Varys attends court as Joffrey rewards Tywin, Loras, and Littlefinger for their service. Varys visits the recuperating Tyrion and sadly informs him that his father is being given all of the credit for the victory and that he has relieved Tyrion as Hand of the King, that the members of the hill tribes have been paid and sent back to the Vale. and that Bronn has been removed from command of the City Watch. He also suggests that Queen Cersei was responsible for Ser Mandon's treachery and leaves Tyrion alone with Shae. Varys also approaches Ros and recruits her as a spy in Littlefinger's brothel.","He talks with Baelish in the Great Hall about the Iron Throne, and Littlefinger's belief is that the realm is a fiction. Varys says that without it there would be chaos, which he characterizes as a pit. Littlefinger disagrees, saying it is a ladder that few are willing to climb. He reveals that he knew of Ros's agreement with Varys to spy on him, and so gave her to Joffrey, who murdered her.","Varys attends a Small Council meeting, and informs the council about Sandor Clegane being spotted in the Riverlands killing Lannister men. Tywin asks what could they do to make a common soldier kill the Hound, Varys replies by paying them silver. Varys then tells them about Daenerys and her army, her dragons, and her rule over Meereen. Cersei says it doesn't matter because they're just babies but Varys tells her that they are not babies anymore. Varys also mentions that Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy joined her cause and Jorah is no longer spying for Varys. Tywin asks if Varys can get a spy in Meereen, and he replies that he can.","Tyrion and Varys depart Pentos in a large carriage. Tyrion remains despondent, and as he promised, he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor. Varys explains that they are travelling to Meereen by way of Volantis. Varys points out that Tyrion was an effective ruler when he was acting Hand of the King, and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities (a eunuch and a dwarf). They enjoyed accumulating power, he says, but they also wall themselves off from other people, like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now. Deep down they were never satisfied being separate from society. Tyrion is unmoved from his depression, and continues to insist that he's tired of being confined in a box of some sort. Varys, however, again warns him that he must remain hidden, as it is unsafe to be seen publicly because Cersei has promised a lordship to any man who brings her his head. Tyrion scoffs and rhetorically asks if Cersei is going to kill every dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him.","Later, Varys interrogates Vala, a prostitute in league with the Sons of the Harpy, who personally betrayed and murdered members of the Unsullied and Second Sons. In exchange for her cooperation, he promises her and her son safe passage on a ship bound for Pentos and a bag of silver to start anew. Once the information has been obtained, Varys informs Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm that the Masters of Astapor, Yunkai, and even Volantis are collectively funding the Sons' rebellion. Tyrion then asks Varys to contact his little birds in all three cities in order to arrange a meeting with the Masters.","After Daenerys has assembled her war council, she gives Varys a rather backhanded thanks for arranging her alliance with the Dornish and House Tyrell; when he attempts to flatter her, she quickly turns the tables, pointing out that he deserted both her father and later Robert Baratheon in relatively short order and played a role in the attempt to have her killed. Tyrion protests that Varys has done much to prove his loyalty, but Daenerys points out that he has made a habit of plotting the downfall of any King that doesn't suit his purpose, and then replacing them with another. Refusing to be intimidated, Varys replies that his lack of blind loyalty to a monarch has actually been beneficial for the Realm, as a whole. As someone who has suffered slavery, torture and poverty all his childhood, his loyalty has never been to any King or Queen, but to the people. Varys wryly remarks that if Daenerys only wants blind loyalty from him, she might as well execute him now; but if she is willing to accept his services, he can give her enormous assistance in taking the Iron Throne. He reaffirms that she is, in his opinion, the last great hope for the people of Westeros. Satisfied, Dany asks him to swear to her that, if he feels she is failing the Realm as Queen, he tell her to her face rather than conspire to replace her. Varys swears to do so.","Quotes by Varys","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Varys is the most enigmatic member of the Small Council. While Varys' own account of his past might not be fully trusted, he was apparently born as a slave in the Free City of Lys and found himself in a mummer's troupe in Myr, where he was castrated, and he later spent time in Pentos. He later found his way to Westeros and rose to the position of Master of Whisperers during the reign of King Aerys II Targaryen. After the conclusion of Robert's Rebellion, Varys was pardoned by King Robert Baratheon and continued to serve him as spymaster and intelligence-gatherer. The TV series confirmed that this is indeed his true backstory, actually showing the sorcerer who castrated him. The TV series omitted the line where he stated that he was specifically born in the city of Lys, though the acting troupe he served in moved around extensively, so he didn't grow up there; afterwards he spent a long time in Myr working his way up in the world, then later moved on to Pentos as an information trafficker. This seems to mean that he is ethnically a Lysene, though then again, as he was born a slave, his parents may have been sold there from somewhere else."],"name":"Varys","description":"Varys is a mysterious man if ever there was one. He is completely unpredictable, in no small part thanks to his stoic, calm and reserved demeanour and his ability to wade through one confrontation after another without losing his dignity, temper or advantage. He frequently claimed that his one and only ambition was to accomplish and to achieve for the good of \"the realm\", although exactly what this means is extremely subjective to those unaware of his true loyalties. Varys is one of the very few people in Westeros who possess immense political power and do not intend to sit on the Iron Throne themselves. He never appears to serve one side for long at all, and may not have served that side in the first place when all is said and done, and nobody appears capable of trusting him.\n\nVarys, in spite of appearing subservient and passive, is an extremely intelligent man, a master of deception, manipulation and calculation. Varys's subtle and calculative nature is made more impressive by him owning the most prominent spy network in all of Westeros, which is only matched by the spy network of Petyr Baelish. Despite having a mutual rivalry and hatred for one another, both Baelish and Varys are incredibly similar: they appear to be sycophantic and meek, but are in fact shockingly ruthless and possess powerful intellect, they both have vast networks of personal spies, traitors and double agents that are entirely at their disposal, and they both rose to positions of great political power. Varys and Littlefinger have such a rivalry with one another so unusually complex that they are able to spar verbally with one another intensely without ever coming to blows. Instead they calmly insult one another as quickly and as precisely as two master swordsmen sparring to the death. However, while Littlefinger has a personal ambition to take all of the reachable power there is in the Seven Kingdoms for himself and eliminate anyone who obstructs him, Varys dedicates himself to be the ultimate kingmaker and is hell-bent on restoring what he sees as prosperity to Westeros for the sake of the people. For all the similarities in their means, the pair are antithetical to each other in their intended ends. Their origins are also significantly different: Littlefinger was born the heir to a noble house (albeit a lower-ranking one) whereas Varys was born a slave, a status he only escaped from after being left for dead following his castration.\n\nEntirely in spite of his reserved and subtle demeanor, Varys is an extremely dangerous man who is capable of unspeakable cruelty and ruthlessness \u2014 though usually only when absolutely necessary. He is not above threatening people to get what is required for his plans, but is also willing to give other players fair warning when warranted. For instance, when Tyrion threatened to throw him into the sea, Varys serenely retorted that he would simply survive and come back to return the favor.\n\nVarys is a survivor of the highest order. He compares the game of thrones to a dangerous body of water and says that he will \"keep on paddling\" through powerful storms, dangerous tides and fish eating each other. Having survived Robert's Rebellion and the War of the Five Kings with nary a scratch, it seems his metaphor is quite apt. Even so, Varys is not incapable of fear: when he was emasculated by a sorcerer, the most terrifying part of the entire experience was when the sorcerer threw his pieces into a fire and a voice answered the sorcerer's call. Varys would spend the rest of his life having nightmares about that voice, becoming painfully introduced to the horrors of the real and supernatural world. He has since developed a disdain for magic in general, especially blood magic, seen when his calm facade falters while confronting High Priestess Kinvara.\n\nVarys's calm facade also masks a somewhat vengeful nature, as he exhausted a great deal of influence to find and capture the sorcerer who castrated him. Varys tells Tyrion, upon observing the bound sorcerer, that revenge is perfectly within his reach, provided that he has the 'stomach' for such a thing\u2014and leaves him alive, intending to take his time and savor the revenge he had long sought. However, with this notable exception, Varys usually does not employ his more ruthless nature unless necessary. He will betray, lie and kill without hesitation, yet he does not do so for his own enjoyment but strictly for the fulfillment of his plans and for his own survival.\n\nDespite his temperament as a skilled manipulator and unwillingness of others around him to trust people like him, he is not incapable of making true friends at a personal level. Tyrion Lannister is the most notable example. Initially saving the dwarf due solely to the fact that he perceived Tyrion to be essential in his plans, Varys and Tyrion eventually develop an amiable friendship during Tyrion's tenure as Hand of the King, enough for Varys to express regret at testifying against him and to put effort into smuggling him to Essos to survive and serve Daenerys. Tyrion has mentioned more than once that he will miss Varys's presence when the eunuch is needed elsewhere; they greatly enjoy conversation with each other, as they are both superb intellectuals with a dry, dark sense of humor, but unlike the sociopathic Baelish Tyrion's compassionate nature is more similar to Varys's.\n\nDuring a conversation with Oberyn, Varys states that he was never interested sexually in either men or women before his castration; however, this is difficult to verify, as he was castrated at a young age, most likely before puberty. Most of the people of Kings' Landing assume he satisfies his desires with his \"little birds\" but this seems unlikely as Varys has never shown any malice or desire towards his spies, and he has himself stated that he would never seek to harm a child. Varys admits that, after his castration, he did sell himself sexually for a while in his struggle to survive the slums of Essos. However, he took no enjoyment from it, and, after witnessing so much cruelty take place in Westeros and Essos as a result of desire, he claims to be relieved that he can no longer experience it.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Varys"}}

The character was confirmed as returning for the third season in May 2012.Tara Fitzgerald was announced in the role in July 2012.","In an interview with HBO.com, Bryan Cogman - who wrote episode that introduced Selyse, \"Kissed by Fire\" - gave a detailed explanation of how he wrote the Dragonstone scenes which showed Stannis' relationships with his wife and daughter. Cogman pointed out the difficultly in this given that Stannis isn't a POV character in the books, so these character relationships are mostly left implied but off-screen. Cogman said: \"...the dysfunctional family Stannis keeps hidden away and largely avoids - Stannis isn't a POV character in the book, so these scenes were born largely from my own imagination (though based on clues and hints from the books).\""],"name":"Selyse Baratheon","description":"Selyse and Stannis have only one living child, a sickly but intelligent daughter, Princess Shireen Baratheon. The rest of Selyse and Stannis's offspring, Petyr, Tommard, and Edric, were all stillborn. She keeps their corpses floating in crystal containers filled with chemicals in her chambers.\n\nQueen Selyse is present at the ritual burning of the statues of the Seven on the shores of Dragonstone, standing at the side of her husband, the King. When Stannis pulls the flaming Lightbringer from one of the statues, she kneels alongside the other worshippers of the Lord of Light. After the ceremony is over, Stannis extends his hand to her and Selyse rises to her feet to walk after him.\n\nMelisandre notes that Selyse has failed to give Stannis a son, but only stillborn boys, and that Selyse is sickly and often confined to her tower at Dragonstone.\n\nStannis later reminds Ser Davos Seaworth how his wife Selyse nearly died during the siege of Storm's End during Robert's Rebellion before Davos was able to breach the lines and bring in supplies.\n\nDepressed following his defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, Stannis visits Selyse for the first time since returning from the battle. He finds her in her chamber, praying over a fire to the Lord of Light: Selyse is a fanatical believer in the religion of R'hllor and was who first invited Melisandre to Dragonstone. Stannis and Selyse do not have a loving relationship, but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the Lord's Chosen. She tells him not to despair despite his defeat, and he will be victorious, but he laments that he used to believe that once. Due to his extreme belief in duty, (unlike his hedonistic brother Robert) Stannis is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to Selyse, when he had sex with Melisandre to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly. He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her, but she interrupts him and says Melisandre already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the Lord of Light can be a sin. Indeed, she wept for joy when Melisandre told her of this service she did for the Lord of Light with Stannis, and because the Red Priestess gave him a \"son\" (of sorts) which she never could. Stannis' face is filled with a mix of shock, disgust, and relief. Selyse had three sons with Stannis but they were all stillborn, and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars. The deaths of her \"sweet boys\" and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected Selyse, and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the Lord of Light. She weeps, and laments that she has given Stannis nothing - he does not blame her, and with pity he says that's not true. Selyse understands he is referring to their daughter and only child, Princess Shireen Baratheon. She grows annoyed when she realizes he's come to see her too, and says he shouldn't waste time on such distractions, but insists that she is his daughter, and she relents because it is not her place to question her king.\n\nOn the beach of Dragonstone, Melisandre presides over a public burning, setting ablaze three people chained to stakes as an offering to the Lord of Light. One of the victims is Queen Selyse Baratheon's own brother, condemned for his lack of faith in the Lord's power. Melisandre is surprisingly silent throughout the proceedings; it is Selyse who takes the greatest pleasure in the ritual. Afterwards, Stannis and Selyse eat dinner, with Melisandre as a guest at their table. The royal couple argue over their daughter, Princess Shireen Baratheon; Selyse believes the girl's disfigurement is a punishment from the Lord of Light, but Stannis angrily forbids his wife from physically chastising their daughter for her perceived faults. Selyse switches tactics and suggests that Melisandre speak to Shireen.\n\nQueen Selyse speaks to Melisandre, who is enjoying a bath. She quips that the Lord of Light told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath, but the joke goes over Selyse's head. To cement Selyse's position as Melisandre's most devoted follower, the Red Priestess tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the Lord of Light and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on. Selyse asks her if she used the potions when she slept with Stannis, to which she replies that she did not. Selyse then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the North but Melisandre is as dismissive about Shireen's \"heresy\" as she always is, and assures Selyse that Shireen will be needed where they are going.\n\nSelyse accompanies Stannis to the North in his defense of the Night's Watch against the wildlings. She is present at the Watch's funeral for their fallen brothers.\n\nSelyse, alongside her daughter, are present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee. She expresses joy as Melisandre speaks of the Lord of Light and when Mance begins to be consumed by the flames.\n\nSelyse finds her daughter teaching Gilly letters so that she may learn to read. The queen disapproves of such action, telling Shireen that her father conquered Gilly's \"people\" and that as a wildling she is still dangerous. Shireen attempts to defend Gilly, but Selyse simply scolds her for being naive, despite all her reading of books.\n\nWith an excruciating reluctance, Stannis offers their daughter to Melisandre to sacrifice her to R'hllor, in order for his prophecy to become true. When the ceremony begins, Selyse at first stands firm her belief that this is the right thing to do. However, as Shireen is tied to the pyre, she begins to squirm and scream, pleading to her mother and father for her life. When the flame is lit and Shireen continues her cry for help, Selyse has a drastic change of heart and begins to implore Stannis to stop the sacrifce. As her implores turn into a beg, Stannis remains unresponsive. When Stannis does not respond to her pleas, Selyse frantically runs toward the sacrificial pyre in a last, desperate attempt to stop the ceremony, but is stopped by equally distraught Baratheon soldiers. As Shireen's screams die away with her, Selyse looks up in horror at her corpse, letting out a scream, while Stannis turns away with tears welling in his eyes - a rare occurrence for someone seemingly emotionless.\n\nConsumed by grief for allowing her daughter to die, Selyse shortly thereafter hangs herself in a copse of trees near the Baratheon camp. Stannis is shaken when his scouts discover her body, and Melisandre in turn flees the scene.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Selyse_Baratheon"}}

However, that friendship ended when Beskha won her freedom, which led Amaya to hold a grudge against Beskha for leaving her behind. \n\nWhen Amaya first sees Beskha she tells the Pit Fighters to restrain her, and tells Asher Forrester that he must want something pretty bad to come to them for it, but if he wanted her interest he wouldn't have come with Beskha.\n\nShe believes Beskha abandoned her by escaping from their Master.

Despite initial shortcomings, Amaya leads the pit fighters during the Battle of Ironrath, where she assaults the Whitehill camp as Rodrik and Beshka go after Lord Whitehill and\/or Gryff. As Rodrik returns to the meeting location, Beskha does not return and Amaya explains that \"Basilisk\" will have to take care of herself.\n\nUpon returning to Ironrath, Amaya leads a charge against the Whitehill army and is pleased that her group was finally fighting the battle as Asher had mentioned.

They then return to Ironrath and witness Asher becoming the new Lord of House Forrester. When Lord Whitehill arrives at Ironrath ordering the Forrester's surrender, Amaya tells Asher to reject the offer so they can battle the Whitehills. Instead, the Forresters decide to trick Ludd into thinking he's won so that they can lure him into Ironrath and kill him.

Baelish remains in the role when King Joffrey inherits the throne. As Master of Coin, Baelish is regarded as a financial magician, always able to conjure up gold to meet the Crown's demands.\n\nWhen Baelish leaves for the Eyrie with a marriage proposal for Lysa Arryn, Tywin Lannister, now Hand of the King, appoints his son Tyrion as the new Master of Coin. Tyrion discovers that his predecessor's financial wizardry actually amounted to borrowing large sums of money from the Iron Bank of Braavos, leaving the Iron Throne heavily in debt.\n\nThe post was left vacant for some time after Tyrion's arrest and conviction for the murder of Joffrey. However, after Tywin was himself later murdered by Tyrion, Cersei seized control and reorganized the Small Council. Stacking the council with men loyal to her by handing out offices as rewards, Cersei appointed Mace Tyrell as the new Master of Coin, in addition to the office he already held as Master of Ships.\n\nAfter Lord Mace was burned alive alongside his children and many others, the post of the Master of Coin became vacant.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Petyr Baelish was appointed Master of Coin by Hand of the King Jon Arryn, around seven years before the beginning of the narrative. Originally, Jon's wife Lysa had convinced her husband to make Baelish the chief customs officer at the port of Gulltown in the Vale. Baelish excelled at the position, increasing revenue tenfold, so ten years ago Lord Arryn brought him to King's Landing and gave him a minor position in the royal customs office. Baelish increased gross revenues tenfold, and demonstrated such great skill that Arryn rapidly advanced him through a series of promotions, so that within three years he was named Master of Coin for the entire realm. Robert's reign lasted fifteen years in the books (expanded to seventeen in the TV series), and Littlefinger was only Master of Coin for the last seven years, but it is unstated which person (or persons) may have held the position in the early years of King Robert's reign. Thus Baelish is not a holdover from the previous Targaryen Small Council, in contrast to Pycelle and Varys, who formerly served under the Mad King.\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Master_of_Coin"}}

He was forced to join the Watch after murdering his brother's killer, Willem, with an axe. Yoren's job is to serve as a \"Wandering Crow\", an officer of the Night's Watch who travels the Seven Kingdoms searching for fresh recruits, either volunteers or criminals that choose a lifetime on the Wall over punishments such as death or mutilation.\n\nYoren meets Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, and Benjen Stark as they are traveling north to the Wall. He arrives at their camp with two rapers, one of which is Rast.\n\nTyrion Lannister befriends Yoren at Castle Black, enjoying the fact that the brother of the Night's Watch has a sense of humor, unlike most of his comrades. They talk about what the strangest thing they've ever eaten is; Tyrion asks if Dornish women count. Yoren considers Benjen Stark as a close friend and ally and sees him off when he departs on a ranging beyond the Wall. He agrees to travel with Tyrion on the Kingsroad back to King's Landing to pick up more recruits from the city dungeons. He is present when Commander Mormont asks Tyrion to use his connections to intercede on behalf of the Night's Watch for more and better quality recruits and funds to rebuild.\n\nYoren and Tyrion arrive at Winterfell, and Robb says pointedly that any man of the Night's Watch is welcome as a guest (making it clear that Tyrion is not welcome). After Tyrion gives Bran the plans for a new saddle Robb changes his mind, but Tyrion says he would prefer the brothel in town. On the road south, he is still travelling with Tyrion when they reach the Crossroads Inn, where he witnesses Tyrion being taken into custody by Catelyn Stark. Yoren rides with all speed to the Red Keep, where he finds Ned Stark and is introduced to Arya. After Jory takes Arya from the room Yoren is able to warn Eddard Stark about his wife's actions before they become public. Eddard agrees to let Yoren comb the city dungeons for fresh recruits for the watch. When Eddard is confronted with his wife's actions he then takes the blame, saying she acted on his orders, leading to confrontations with Robert Baratheon and Jaime Lannister.\n\nEddard is arrested for treason when he questions the legitimacy of the king's successor, Joffrey Baratheon. Lord Stark is brought to the Great Sept of Baelor to stand trial and Arya watches from the square. To see over the heads of the crowd, she climbs onto the pedestal of Baelor's statue. When Eddard is brought out he spots her. Then as Eddard is pulled through the crowd, he goes past Yoren and manages to point her out to Yoren by head jerk and saying \"Baelor\" hoping that Yoren will recognize her and wishing him to protect Arya. Despite a confession, Eddard is unexpectedly executed on Joffrey's orders.\n\nYoren grabs Arya as she is trying to rush to her father. She is pushing her way through the crowd trying to draw her sword. He holds her still, covers her ears, and keeps her from witnessing the beheading by blocking her view. Once out of the square he cuts Arya's hair with a knife and instructs her to pose as a boy. He intends to take her north to Winterfell and safety, hiding her among a group of 20 recruits for the Night's Watch. He instructs her to go by the name Arry the orphan boy, because no one cares or asks questions of orphans. Yoren warns her not to trust the other recruits, as any of them could turn her in for a reward, or rape her.\n\nYoren takes the recruits along the Kingsroad into the Riverlands. He warns the rest of the party to stay away from the three prisoners caged in the wagon. Two gold cloaks find the party camped in the Riverlands, and are there requesting for a bastard name Gendry. Yoren blatantly ignores their requests despite the cloaks providing royal warrants, stating that all his recruits now belong to the Night's Watch. The lead gold cloak moves to draw his sword but is halted when Yoren places the point of his dagger against his femoral artery. Yoren notes that men worry about their throats but often forget about the vulnerability of their lower regions. Yoren takes the man's sword, saying that good steel is always needed on the Wall. Yoren tells the gold cloak that he has a choice; die there or return to King's Landing and tell his master that they did not find what they were looking for. The gold cloak defiantly shouts that they are looking for Gendry and describes the bull's head helmet that he carries. He offers a reward to anyone turning him over and promises that he will return with more men.\n\nLater, Arya sits up cleaning Needle while the rest of the recruits sleep. Yoren enters the room, sits down and inquires what is troubling her. She asks him how he sleeps with the terrible things that he has seen. He notes that she should not be worried about that as he made sure she did not see her father's execution. She says that she cannot forget seeing the Queen, Joffrey, and Sansa standing next to her father on the podium. In response, Yoren tells her about the murder of his brother by a boy named Willem. He says that he thought constantly about revenge and eventually made it a ritual to say the killer's name before falling asleep. When Willem returned to town, Yoren killed him with an axe and then took his horse to ride to the Wall and join the Night's Watch to avoid prosecution.

He is a member of the Thirteen, an organization that rules over Qarth.\n\nHe boasts of being the wealthiest man in Qarth. In Qarth, a merchant invited into the Thirteen remains in his seat for as long as he is feared or respected enough not to be denied membership by his other twelve peers, unlike the Pureborn, who hold hereditary seats.\n\nXaro Xhoan Daxos has heard rumors concerning the return of magic into the world. Among them are glass candles burning, ghost grass growing far away from the Shadow Lands and a Dothraki khalasar led by a woman with three heads, presumably Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons.\n\nXaro and the Thirteen meet Khaleesi Daenerys Targaryen at the gates of Qarth, weeks after the Thirteen met with Daenerys's bloodrider Kovarro. They demand to see her dragons and when she refuses they deny her admission to the city. Xaro invokes the ancient custom of Sumai to allow her and her people to be admitted under his protection. Xaro welcomes Daenerys to the city and makes her a guest in his expansive mansion. He makes repeated references to the fact that he came to Qarth with nothing, but by skill and determination has made himself the richest man in the city.\n\nXaro hosts a lavish reception for Daenerys in his gardens to introduce her around to Qarth's social elites, and showers her with gifts. Later that night, he shows her his massive treasure vault which is impossible to open without the key he always wears around his neck. Inside is his enormous fortune which he promises to divide with her if she will marry him. Xaro informs Daenerys that news has reached Qarth that King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the subsequent outbreak of the War of the Five Kings which is tearing Westeros apart. Daenerys learns that the major noble Houses which played an active role in deposing House Targaryen are now fighting each other: Robb Stark is fighting the Lannisters, and the Baratheons have been split between Robert's two younger brothers, Stannis and Renly.\n\nDaenerys is at first excited by this news, as she has lived in fear of Robert Baratheon her entire life. More importantly, the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings means that House Targaryen's enemies are now divided. She seriously considers Xaro's offer of a marriage-alliance, as he can provide her with enough money to raise an army to invade Westeros with. Her advisor Ser Jorah Mormont is more hesitant, however, stressing that men like Xaro only want something in return. Daenerys acknowledges that Xaro has openly admitted that he hopes to become even wealthier if Daenerys reconquers Westeros as his wife, but Jorah points out that this won't simply be rewarding Xaro: the lords of the Seven Kingdoms will say that it was Xaro's conquest, achieved with resources he provided, and Daenerys will become little more than a figurehead.\n\nInitially eager to take the quickest path back to Westeros, Daenerys eventually relents to Jorah's advice and decides to decline Xaro's offer for the moment. Instead she tries to secure support for her return to Westeros from his colleagues in the Thirteen, but without success. While they are meeting with the Spice King her dragons are stolen from Xaro's home. One of Daenerys's maids Irri is dead while the other, Doreah, is missing and presumed dead. Xaro uses the theft as a premise to hold a council of the Thirteen in his home. He then stages a coup with the assistance of the warlock Pyat Pree and declares himself King of Qarth. The warlock uses his magic to kill the rest of the Thirteen. They reveal that they stole the dragons and have taken them to the House of the Undying. Daenerys flees in terror.\n\nDaenerys later escapes from the House of the Undying after retrieving her dragons and with her men invades Xaro's house where she finds Xaro in bed with Doreah, revealing that she had in fact betrayed Daenerys and her dragons to Xaro and Pyat Pree. Xaro and Doreah plead for their lives, with Xaro promising to get her ships to invade Westeros. Using the circular key pendant, the treasure vault is opened and found to be empty, his enormous wealth a lie to cling on to his power and seat. Xaro and Doreah are locked inside the merchant prince's vault to die, and Daenerys and her people ransack Xaro's house of all its gold and precious items, which Ser Jorah says will be enough to buy a small ship.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Xaro_Xhoan_Daxos"}}

Jaehaerys wisely negotiated a peace with the Faith by granting an amnesty to all surviving members of the Faith Militant if they would only lay down their arms and disband, and in return the crown would swear to always defend the Faith. \"Maegor's laws\" forbidding holy men from carrying weapons remained in force up until the War of the Five Kings, when Cersei Lannister short-sightedly rescinded them to allow the Faith Militant to be re-created."],"name":"Maegor Targaryen","description":"King Aegon the Conqueror had two children by his two sister-wives: his firstborn son Aenys with his sister Queen Rhaenys, and his second-born son Maegor with his sister Queen Visenya Targaryen. When Aegon I eventually died, Aenys succeeded him as the second king on the Iron Throne.\n\nThe Targaryens had incestuously married brother to sister for generations (whenever possible) to \"keep the bloodline pure\", in the custom of their Valyrian ancestors. For that matter, Aegon I broke not only the Faith's rules against incest, but its rules against polygamy, as he was married to both of his sisters at the same time.  The Faith wasn't in much position to challenge the victorious Targaryen army after the Conquest, or their massive dragons, but Aegon I was wise enough to tread lightly with the Faith: both sides tacitly agreed that the Targaryens' incestuous marriages were a relic of their past, which would soon fade. Aegon I didn't intend for future generations of his new dynasty to continue to have incestuous marriages, and in return, the Faith didn't press the matter for the remainder of his life. Aegon I eventually died and was succeeded by his elder son, Aenys.\n\nTo the surprise of all, however, later in his reign King Aenys tactlessly wed his daughter to his own son: the incestuous marriage of Princess Rhaena and Prince Aegon broke the Targaryens' prior promise to the Faith, which could stand the abomination no longer. The new High Septon led the denunciation of the Targaryens, and the military order of the Faith of the Seven, the Faith Militant, rose up in open revolt. King Aenys proved to be an utter weakling in the face of the revolt and was completely overwhelmed. As the Faith Militant attacked lords that still supported him across the Seven Kingdoms, one particularly zealous force of the order even managed to scale the walls of the (still under construction) Red Keep, and would have killed Aenys and the royal family if not for the intervention of the Kingsguard. Frightened, Aenys fled King's Landing entirely and retreated to the Targaryen fortress-refuge at Dragonstone - where he soon died of cramps brought on from the stress.\n\nAenys was then succeeded by his younger half-brother Maegor, Aegon I's only child by Visenya - seizing power ahead of Aenys's own children. Maegor was his brother's exact opposite: a highly skilled warrior and brutal tyrant, quickly earning him the name \"Maegor the Cruel\".\n\nKing Maegor struck back against the Faith Militant. When he arrived in King's Landing his first act was to challenge their leaders to kill him in personal combat, if they believed his rule to be ungodly. The Faith accepted, and Ser Damon Morrigen proposed they hold a trial of seven - the more dangerous but theoretically more holy variant of a traditional trial by combat in which two teams of seven men fight each other. Many tales are told of their confrontation, Ser Damon and six of the Faith Militant against Maegor and members of his Kingsguard - but all the stories agree that at the end, out of all fourteen men only Maegor himself remained alive, proving that the throne was rightfully his.  Having survived the trial of seven, Maegor promptly mounted the great black dragon Balerion - his father's old mount that Maegor mastered for himself upon his death - and flew it to the headquarters of the city's local chapter of the Faith Militant, at the Sept of Remembrance. Maegor used Balerion to burn down the sept and all who were inside while they were in the middle of the morning prayers. Hundreds of the Faith Militant burned to death, their screams echoing through the streets.\n\nMaegor now demanded the complete destruction of the Faith Militant, and made war upon the order wherever he found it. Yet the Faith Militant would not surrender, raising its own armies across the realm, and turning some of Maegor's own lords against him. Many battles were fought as the Faith Militant uprising dragged on for years, lasting throughout all of Maegor's reign.\n\nMaegor finished constructing the Red Keep during his reign, including the formidable central fortification which was named \"Maegor's Holdfast\" after him. After the construction was finished, Maegor had all the workers and masons killed, reportedly in order that only he would know all of the secret tunnels he had them build hidden throughout the castle.\n\nEventually, Maegor's reign of terror came to an end when he died upon the Iron Throne itself. Maegor's cruelty died with him, however, as he was succeeded by Aenys's remaining son, who became King Jaehaerys I. A wise and benevolent ruler, Jaehaerys I made peace with the Faith in return for disbanding the Faith Militant, ending the uprisings. Jaehaerys's subsequent long reign did much to mend the wounds to the realm caused by Maegor.\n\nWhile visiting the Great Hall of the Red Keep, Septa Mordane quizzes Sansa Stark on her history lessons, and asks her who built the structure and the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly responds that Aegon the Conqueror made the Iron Throne, and \"Maegor the Cruel\" built the Red Keep.\n\nWisdom Hallyne mentions that Maegor was a great patron of the Alchemists' Guild and their work producing wildfire, which he used against his enemies.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Maegor was the second son of Aegon I Targaryen. His mother was Aegon's elder sister-wife Visenya Targaryen. He was the third king of the Targaryen dynasty - usurping the throne ahead of his half-brother Aenys's children - and is infamously remembered as a brutal tyrant.\n\nAegon I kept a mobile royal court, making royal progresses around his new realm to bind it together, and while the Red Keep was still under construction. Aegon kept Aenys with him as his heir, while Maegor was raised back at the ancestral Targaryen castle on Dragonstone. In time Maegor was commonly referred to as \"the Prince of Dragonstone\" - though at the time this was just a nickname, it became a by-word for his status as Aenys's presumed heir.\n\nMaegor was a preternaturally skilled swordsman (not unlike the later Jaime Lannister), at the age of barely 12 he easily defeated squires five years older than himself. He was one of the youngest men ever knighted, at only 16 years old. In contrast, Aenys was physically frail and no great warrior, better suited to the comforts of court life and a patron of the arts. While Aenys wore fine silks at court, during his own reign Maegor most commonly wore armor, because he was constantly on military campaigns. When the two brothers were young, Aenys bonded with the dragon Quicksilver, one of the progeny of Aegon I's original three dragons. Maegor, however, refused to bond with any of the other half-dozen dragon hatchlings at the time, claiming none were worthy. Apparently, Maegor was holding out for his father's own mount, Balerion the Black Dread himself, the greatest living dragon - after Aegon I died of a stroke in his old age, Maegor successfully bonded with the great beast, and used him to devastating effect in crushing those who rebelled against the Iron Throne.\n\nAegon the Conqueror maintained a polygamous marriage with both of his sisters: Aenys's mother Rhaenys and Maegor's mother Visenya. Aegon himself always treated Aenys as his heir apparent because he was older than Maegor - though given young Aenys's frailty, there were some who muttered that Maegor should be his heir, given that he was his \"firstborn\" by Visenya - those who said this were chiefly Visenya herself, and her supporters, though Aegon I would hear none of it.\n\nAegon I was still wary of offending the Faith of the Seven, and promised them that his family's marriage practices of incest and polygamy - which the Faith considered abominations - were a relic of the past which they wouldn't continue in the future. To assure him of this, he had Aenys marry Alyssa Velaryon as a political match, who was mother to all of his children. Thus, the birth of Aenys's own children pushed Maegor even further back in the line of succession, as by the normal laws of Westeros an uncle only inherits after his elder brother's entire bloodline is extinguished.\n\nMaegor's mother Visenya didn't give up on her ambitions in court politics, however, pushing for Maegor to one day succeed ahead of Aenys. Thus when Aenys's first child was born, his daughter Rhaena, Visenya urged Aegon I to betroth her to her Maegor, her own half-uncle. Aegon I, however, dismissed the suggestion - both because he didn't want to risk offending the Faith with such an incestuous marriage, and (it is believed) because he had become frustrated with Visenya's constant attempts to usurp Rhaenys's son Aenys with her own. To further appease the High Septon, Aegon made Maegor marry Ceryse of House Hightower - the High Septon's own niece. As the years passed Maegor failed to produce any heir, and there were fears that he was sterile - causing him to lose supporters, who didn't think it was worth upsetting Aegon I's intended succession for an heir who couldn't continue the family line anyway.\n\nAfter their father Aegon I died from a stroke in old age (in 37 AC), Aenys succeeded to the throne. Four separate localized rebellions immediately broke out trying to seize on the opportunity of what they perceived as Aegon's weak successor: in the Iron Islands, at Harrenhal, at the Eyrie, and the \"Vulture King\" leading a bandit army in the Red Mountains along the border with Dorne. Their bastard uncle Orys Baratheon died from his wounds successfully putting down the insurrection in Dorne, and the current Hand of the King died putting down the rebels at Harrenhal, while Maegor used Balerion to successfully crush the rebels in the Vale.\n\nTherefore, as a reward for his success in handling the rebellion in the Vale, Aenys named Maegor to fill the vacant office as his new Hand of the King. With Aegon I, Rhaenys, and now Orys dead, Dowager Queen Visenya became the last of the Conquest-generation of Targaryens, and she did much to aid her son Maegor's rise in power. Aenys even gave Maegor the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of House Targaryen, Blackfyre, which had been carried by their father - openly acknowledging that Maegor was a better warrior than he ever was. For a brief two years, the two brothers ruled the realm together in peace.\n\nYet Maegor grew increasingly frustrated with his childless marriage, as Aenys continued to produce more heirs of his own to push him far down in line of succession, and the High Septon would never grant Maegor a separation from his own niece Ceryse. Eventually, two years into Aenys's reign Maegor polygamously took a second wife, Alys of House Harroway (the ceremony performed by Visenya, as no septon was willing to perform it). This angered the Faith so much that Aenys had to strip him off his office and exile him to Pentos. Aenys then announced that he was making \"Prince of Dragonstone\" the official title of the designated heir to the throne - and that he was bestowing it on his son Prince Aegon, to dispel any lingering sentiments that Maegor was his direct heir ahead of his own children.\n\nWith Maegor gone, there was no pragmatic restraint on Aenys's poor decisions. Despite an already strained relationship with the Faith, two years later Aenys foolishly announced the marriage of his daughter and eldest child Rhaena to his eldest son Aegon, directly sparking the Faith Militant uprising. Aenys was physically and emotionally overwhelmed by the rebellion, and fled King's Landing entirely to withdraw to Dragonstone, where he became nearly catatonic and is said to have died of cramps brought on by the stress (though many suspect that Visenya poisoned him). Whatever the case, barely an hour after Aenys's body was cremated, Visenya flew to Pentos on Vhagar to retrieve Maegor, who flew back with her to Westeros riding Balerion.\n\nUpon his return to Dragonstone in 42 AC, Maegor was immediately crowned king - usurping the throne ahead of Aenys's five children. Rather than wear Aenys's ostentatiously large gold crown, Maegor wore his father Aegon I's own crown - a circlet of Valyrian steel with seven cut rubies set in it - symbolically asserting his status as his father's true heir (now possessing his father's crown, sword, and dragon). Grand Maester Gawen was the only one to openly protest, pointing out that Aenys had three sons (Aegon, Viserys, and Jaehaerys) and by every inheritance law in Westeros, Maegor was behind them in line of succession. Maegor responded by beheading Gawen with a single swing of Blackfyre, and no one else spoke a word against him - many feeling that Aenys's young children could not handle the Faith Militant as Maegor could. He retook King's Landing, won a trial by seven with the Faith Militant, then burned the Sept of Remembrance using Balerion to wipe out their King's Landing chapter at a single stroke. An army of the Faith Militant was slaughtered at Bitterbridge, and an even greater battle was fought at the Great Fork of the Gods Eye, with Maegor riding Balerion during a great rainstorm - this battle was bloody but decisive, with Maegor wiping out the opposing force.\n\nNonetheless, uprisings continued in similar though usually smaller scale flashpoints for the next six years: Maegor would always succeed in destroying the Faith Militant's armies when they marched openly against him, but he would still end up losing men and resources to attrition, and before long more new converts to the Faith Militant would pop up again in another part of the realm far away from where his main armies had currently moved. Also, when Maegor returned from the Free Cities in 42 AC he brought with him a new, third polygamous wife, called Tyanna of Pentos - rumored to be a sorceress and poisoner. Maegor appointed her as his new Mistress of Whisperers, and she became greatly feared.\n\nIn 43 AL, Aenys's son and heir Prince Aegon (who had managed to avoid capture), led his own revolt against Maegor to claim the throne that was rightfully his. This was not technically considered to be part of the Faith Militant uprising, however, because the Faith was also particularly upset about Aegon's incestuous marriage to his own sister. Prince Aegon was the new rider of his father's dragon, Quicksilver, by this time over 30 years old and a full-grown adult beast. Rebel lords rallied around Prince Aegon and his dragon, and they clashed with Maegor and his army in the great Battle Beneath the Gods Eye. Prince Aegon rode Quicksilver into battle against Maegor riding Balerion - the first time two dragons had fought each other since before the Doom of Valyria. Quicksilver, however, had no hope of defeating the older and larger Balerion, then at the height of his power and majesty: both Prince Aegon and his dragon died in the battle.\n\nIn 44 AL, the High Septon who initiated the uprising suddenly died - many suspect he was poisoned by Maegor's agents. He was replaced by a new High Septon who was Maegor's puppet, but the Faith Militant refused to surrender and the fighting continued. Also in 44 AL Dowager Queen Visenya died, last of the Conquest generation of Targaryens, and Maegor's greatest supporter throughout his life. He actually seemed to take her death in stride, but Aenys's widow Alyssa Velaron - who had been held prisoner on Dragonstone - used the confusion of Visenya's death to escape, along with her two youngest children, Jaehaerys and Alysanne, and Visenya's own sword Dark Sister. Aenys's middle son Viserys was being held hostage at the Red Keep, however, and when Maegor found out about Alyssa's escape he had him tortured to death and his body left to rot in the courtyard (trying to lure Alyssa back to demand a proper funeral, but she didn't take the bait). In 45 AL Maegor launched into a new major campaign, which resulted in him taking the skulls of 2,000 men of the Faith Militant as trophies.\n\nMaegor's supporters, however, grew increasingly unsettled at such open brutality. By this point his mental state was becoming increasingly unhinged (even relative to his prior actions), because none of his wives could produce him an heir - many whispering that he could not continue the Targaryen dynasty on his own. In 47 AL he forcibly wed three women in a triple marriage ceremony (for a total of six concurrent wives). These three \"Black Brides\" were all the widows of men he had killed in his wars, of proven fertility because they already had children - among them his own half-niece Rhaena. Even then, his wives only bore him stillborn monsters, each of which greatly distressed him, and he descended into genuine madness. The first of these stillborn abominations was produced in 48 AL, to his second wife Alys Harroway of Harrenhal: his third wife Tyanna of Pentos convinced him that it was the product of an affair Alys had, so Maegor executed Alys, her midwives, the Grand Maester, and every member of House Harroway, exterminating it. Eventually, however, Tyanna was somehow made to confess that she had actually used poison (and possibly sorcery) to produce the stillbirths in Maegor's other wives - at which he cut out her living heart with Blackfyre, and threw it to his dogs.\n\nAt this point the realm could tolerate Maegor's behavior no longer. Later that same year in 48 AL a new army of the Faith Militant organized, and rebel lords rallied around the fugitive Prince Jaehaerys. Maegor's own Master of Ships Daemon Velaryon left to side with the rebels, at which all of the other great lords of the realm abandoned him in short order - among them even his former close supporters like the Baratheons and even the Tullys (who had fought against Prince Aegon for him not long before).\n\nWhen Maegor called on any remaining loyal lords to come to his aid, no armies came - even two of the Kingsguard abandoned him to join the growing rebel army as it advanced on King's Landing. It was only a matter of time until they reached the defenseless city. Maegor was found dead in the morning, sitting on the Iron Throne itself. The histories do not confirm exactly how he died: in some versions of the tale, he was murdered by the Iron Throne, while others suspect he was poisoned. Historians consider the most likely scenario that as Maegor sat despondently on the Iron Throne in an empty hall late at night, simply waiting for the hours to pass until the rebel army came to take the city, he looked down at the still-sharp blades that made up the Iron Throne and - resolving never to be taken alive - slit open his own wrists on the throne itself, and bled to death.\n\nMaegor's reign of terror at an end, Aenys's rightful heir Jaehaerys was restored to the throne, ushering in an 80 year golden age for the Targaryen dynasty.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Maegor_Targaryen"}}

Jon hesitates in killing one, realizing the wildling, Ygritte, is a woman. Qhorin questions her and then leaves Jon alone to execute her. Jon does not return and Qhorin goes looking for him. He finds Jon's tracks but is ambushed by wildlings while following them. Qhorin's men are killed and he is taken prisoner by the wildlings. He is soon joined in captivity by Jon. He urges Jon to ensure that the deaths of his men were not meaningless and says that he could be a valuable spy in the wildling ranks. He then feigns anger with Jon to make him seem more sympathetic to Ygritte, and to make him look like a traitor to the Watch.\n\nLater on, Qhorin realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings, so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword, attacking Jon with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery. The Lord of Bones lets them fight, and Ygritte gives Jon back his sword. Qhorin enrages Jon by insulting his parentage. After a fierce duel, Jon mortally stabs Qhorin per Qhorin's own instructions, who whispers to Jon \"We are the watchers on the Wall\" before he breathed his last, signaling to Jon that he has done the right thing and reminding him where his loyalties lie. As planned, by killing Qhorin, the wildlings believe Jon has betrayed his oath and release him. On Rattleshirt's advice, Qhorin's body is burned to ensure he will not return as a wight.\n\nWhen Jon is put on trial before a panel of black brothers for his time with the wildlings, Ser Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt accuse Jon of murdering Qhorin and initially refuse to believe that Qhorin would sacrifice himself so easily, despite Thorne having considered Qhorin like his own brother. Maester Aemon, however, believes Jon's claims and he is spared.\n\nWhen Jon Snow and Sansa Stark are reunited, Jon laments having killed men he admires, among them likely Qhorin.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Qhorin"}}

Because of this, he sent them beyond the Wall to the North Grove to protect it.\n\nAs they approach the North Grove, Gared, Cotter, and Sylvi are attacked by Josera's snow bear, Shadow. They manage to fend it off long enough to reach the grove, where his sister Elsera forces him to stop attacking the group. The three newcomers are held at knifepoint, until Gared reveals that he was sent by House Forrester. Josera disbelieves his claim, even after he presents proof, but Elsera urges her brother to trust the squire. The two give their names, and Gared then reveals that he came to the North Grove because of Gregor's last words to him. Josera is shocked to learn of Gregor's death, and angered that Gared doesn't know the identity of himself and his sister. Before they have time to talk further, the group learns of wights approaching the grove and move to defend it. Josera has Sylvi tied up, but Gared can convince him to free her.

Josera believes Gregor banished them to hide his shame. Upon arriving at a clearing, Josera wargs into Shadow and prepares to fight the wights. He takes out several during the ensuing melee. Gared defends his human body in the meantime, taking out Finn as a wight if he was killed in the previous episode. The group comes out victorious, and Josera gruffly thanks Gared for his help.

Her training is complete upon killing the Waif and he fully deems her to be \"no one\".","*- played by an uncredited extra, face not shown.","In the books, Arya asks Jaqen to kill different men than in the series. One is Chiswyck, a man-at-arms in service of Gregor Clegane. The second is Weese, the understeward of Harrenhal, who served as the basis for Weasel. Arya asks Jaqen to help her free the northern prisoners, but he refuses, until she names him as the third to be killed. Reluctantly, Jaqen agrees to her request, and together with Rorge and Biter they kill several guards and free the prisoners. Soon afterwards Jaqen disappears. He does not help Arya to escape from Harrenhal."],"name":"Jaqen H'ghar","description":"Jaqen is surprisingly calm in the face of danger, yet courteous. Hailing from Lorath he uses identity-less speech patterns in which he refers to people using the third person indefinite, e.g., saying \"a man thanks a girl\" when he is directly addressing Arya and expressing his own thanks.\n\nJaqen is a criminal from the Free Cities, arrested by the City Watch and thrown into the dungeons of the Red Keep in King's Landing. When looking for fresh recruits for the Night's Watch, Yoren was given permission by Lord Eddard Stark, Hand of the King to go through the dungeons and take any criminals who would swear to take the black. He chose H'ghar as a potential candidate, as well as two other murderers Biter and Rorge from the black cells, where the worst criminals are kept.\n\nJaqen H'ghar is in the party led by Yoren that leaves King's Landing for the Wall, along with Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands, Gendry, and Arya Stark who is being smuggled out to be returned to Winterfell. Because Yoren is traveling so far with so few men, the worst three are kept in a locked barred cell on the back of a wagon.\n\nJaqen calls over \"Arry\" (who is actually Arya Stark). He asks her to fill a tankard with water and tells her that he has not drunk for a day and a night, always referring to himself as \u201Ca man\u201D and her as \u201Ca boy\u201D. Rorge, one of the other prisoners, rattles the cage and threatens Arya. Jaqen asks Arya for forgiveness and tells her that he has not chosen his companions. He confirms her identity as Arry and introduces himself, saying that he comes from Lorath. Rorge demands beer and insults Arya. She says that he should have asked nicely, drops all but one of her sticks and uses it to hit his hand. He recoils and then tries to grab her through the cage. Biter moves up behind Rorge and hisses as Rorge threatens Arya again. Jaqen smiles and tells Arya that she has more courage than sense as she backs away.\n\nThe group is resting in a barn when they are roused to arms by Yoren and told they are being attacked. As they rush outside one man trips and drops his torch, setting a fire near the prisoner wagon. They are met by Ser Amory Lorch and a force of men loyal to House Lannister. Lorch points out the Gold Cloaks with him and says that they have come for Gendry, a royal bastard. Lorch orders Yoren and the recruits to drop their weapons. Yoren remains defiant and Lorch orders him shot.\n\nSeeing their leader killed, Gendry and many of the other recruits join the fight. Arya is distracted by Jaqen calling for help as the flames lick the bars of his cage. She hands him an axe before rushing to join the fray. Gendry is overwhelmed and knocked down. As Arya runs round a corner she is knocked over and taken prisoner along with the other survivors. Jaqen does not fight against the Lannister men, though he's surprised that Arya helped him.\n\nThe prisoners are taken to Harrenhal, one being picked each day by Ser Gregor Clegane to be tortured and killed under the supervision of a man called the Tickler. Lord Tywin Lannister arrives and ends the pointless brutality, choosing Arya as his cupbearer. After being told to fetch water by Tywin Lannister, Arya meets Jaqen again; however, he is dressed in a Lannister uniform. She accuses him of being \"one of them now\", but he counters her, questioning for whom she is fetching water.\n\nJaqen says he always knew she was a girl, but she was entitled to her secret. He then informs her of the debt he, Rorge, and Biter owe her. Because she saved three lives, she has taken three lives from the Red God. He says that they must be given back and that she is to name three people who will be killed to repay the debt. Arya names the torturer known as The Tickler. The Tickler is found dead in the courtyard, under the windows of a raised walkway. Arya goes to the body and looks up to see Jaqen staring down. He touches his cheek with one finger, indicating that the first death has been repaid.\n\nJaqen is approached by a panicked Arya, who desperately requests her second death: Ser Amory Lorch. He had become suspicious of her intent while ferreting Lannister documents. Jaqen bristles at her insistence on urgency. Arya explains the situation and he reluctantly obliges, assassinating Ser Amory with a dart dipped in wolfsbane to the neck seconds before he reaches Tywin Lannister.\n\nThe assassination triggers the suspicion of Tywin, and he orders the interrogation and execution of dozens of his own men in order to solve it, but does not uncover Jaqen. Tywin leaves Harrenhal while Jaqen is on patrol; Arya is frustrated as she had decided to make him her last name. Instead she asks Jaqen to aid her and her friends in escaping but he refuses, as it is outside of their arrangement. She asks if she can name anyone and Jaqen swears an oath that who ever she names he will kill. To his horror, Arya says his own name, asking him to kill himself. At Jaqen's plea, she agrees to revoke his name only if he will help her. He reluctantly tells her to assemble her friends at the courtyard gate at midnight. At midnight there is no sign of Jaqen but Arya follows his instructions anyways, only to find out that Jaqen has killed all of the guards on the gate and pinned them in place with spears to avoid arousing suspicion. They are able to walk through the gate unnoticed.  Having left Harrenhal, Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie see Jaqen on top of a cliff. Arya approaches him and he offers to take her with him to Braavos to join the Faceless Men. Though she wants to, Arya declines saying she must find her brother, mother and sister. Jaqen gives her a coin and tells her that if she decides to go to Braavos she must show the coin to a Braavosi and say the words \"Valar Morghulis\". He tells her to say the words and then announces that Jaqen H'ghar is dead. He turns his face away from Arya and when he turns back his face has changed. \"Jaqen\" then says \"Farewell, Arya Stark\" and walks away, seeming to have known her true identity all along.\n\nAt Saltpans, Arya Stark approaches Ternesio Terys seeking passage to the Wall. After he tells her that he is going to Braavos, their home port, Arya shows him the iron coin which Jaqen H'ghar gave her. As Terys looks in awe, she tells him \"valar morghulis\". He promptly nods his head and replies \"valar dohaeris\", offering her a cabin aboard the Titan's Daughter.\n\nAt Braavos, after being dropped at the House of Black and White, Arya Stark calls to the door of the ancient building. An old man answers her call and she asks for Jaqen H'ghar, only to be told that there is no one by that name inside. Some time later, Arya is saved by the same Faceless Man and follows him. Before the gates of the House of Black and White, the man assumes the visage of Jaqen H'ghar. However, he insists he's not Jaqen H'ghar, but \"no one\", as all Faceless Men are, and he tells Arya she must learn to be \"no one\" as well.\n\nA few days later, Jaqen helps a man commit suicide while Arya watches and sweeps the floor. When she comes to him and tells him that she no longer wants to sweep the floor because she wants to train, he tells her that she is training: to serve, as all Faceless Men must.\n\nJaqen later interrupts the Waif as she plays the 'game of faces' with Arya, claiming that she is not ready. When he sees all her things in her room, including her sword Needle, he hints to her that she must dispose of all ties to her former life as Arya Stark in order to continue her training to be \"no one\". After Arya disposes of her belongings, Jaqen takes her deeper into the House of Black and White where she is to help the Waif clean the bodies of those who have taken their lives in the House.\n\nLater, when Arya is asleep, Jaqen H'ghar comes to test Arya again. This time, when he asks Arya who she is, Arya tells him how she came to join the Faceless Men, trying to slip in a few lies into the story. However, Jaqen is able to tell when Arya is lying and hits her with a switch whenever she does. Before he leaves, he tells her that she is lying not only to him, but to herself as well.\n\nWhen, eventually, Arya proves herself, Jaqen brings her to the Hall of Faces, a great underground chamber that houses thousands of faces. All the faces had been taken from the corpses that the acolytes wash in the temple. The Faceless Man then asks Arya if she is ready to give up who she is to become \"no one\". After a moment of silence, he then states that she is not ready to become \"no one\", but that she is ready to become \"someone else\".\n\nArya assumes the identity of Lanna, a clam-seller, and shows Jaqen H'ghar she can convincingly become a different person, developing an elaborate and very believable backstory. The Faceless Man sends her, as Lanna, to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as \"the thin man\" refuse a contract to insure a man's boat, leaving the man in desperate circumstances. Jaqen explains the thin man's business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements; when a ship captain dies at sea, he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family, but he often doesn't. Jaqen instructs her to kill him, and hands her a \"gift\" for the thin man \u2014a vial of poison.\n\nThe next day, Arya returns to the House of Black and White empty-handed, having abandoned her first mission for the Faceless Men. When Jaqen H'ghar asks what happened, she lies to him and says that the Thin Man simply wasn't hungry today and didn't order any over her oysters. Jaqen quips that perhaps this is why he is a \"thin man\", and Arya promises that she will follow through on the assassination tomorrow. She departs, and while Jaqen seems to suspect that she was lying, he makes no outward reaction to it. Arya will have a lot of work to do soon.\n\nAfter killing Meryn Trant, Arya returns to the House of Black and White and returns the face that she used to hide her identity. However, Jaqen H'ghar and the Waif appear and say that Meryn's life was not hers to take, and that a debt must be paid. The Waif grabs Arya as Jaqen pulls out a vial, presumably containing some kind of poison. He however drinks the poison himself and collapses, with Arya screaming for him to stay alive. Arya states that he was her friend, and hears Jaqen's voice behind her say 'he was no one'. She turns around to see that the Waif now has Jaqen's face, and Arya asks who the person on the floor with Jaqen's face is. Jaqen, in the Waif's body, says that he is no one, as Arya begins to remove multiple faces off the person on the floor, until she sees her own face. She then begins to lose her sight, as her eyes turn white and screams for help.\n\nArya has been a blind beggar in the streets of Braavos since she lost her sight in the Hall of Faces. The Waif shows up daily to torment her and beat her with a staff. One day, after being hit by the Waif, Arya tries to strike back with her rod, only to have it caught in mid-air by Jaqen H'ghar, who has been watching. He promises that if she says her name, he would provide her shelter, clothes and have her eyesight restored. However, Arya resisted the temptations and said that she has no name. Satisfied, he tells Arya to follow him, and that she is a beggar no more.\n\nBack at the House of Black and White, Jaqen observes the Waif fighting with Arya and is pleased to see Arya successfully defend herself while still blind. He offers to give Arya her sight back if she says her name, and as before, she says \"A girl has no name.\" He calls her to come to him at the central fountain, fills a cup from the pool, and hands it to her. Arya hesitates for a moment, knowing that the water is poisoned and meant for those seeking a quick and painless death. Jaqen reminds her that as someone with no identity at all, she should be completely void of fears. Arya calmly drinks from the cup, and her sight is restored.\n\nJaqen gives Arya the task of assassinating Lady Crane, an actress in a troupe, and implies that she will be marked for death if she is not successful. Arya reconnoiters her target at a play caricaturing the War of the Five Kings, and notes that Lady Crane is the only one who drinks from a certain bottle of rum.\n\nThe two agree that poisoning the rum will be the method of assassination, and Arya proceeds to poison Lady Crane's rum at another showing of the play. When Arya prevents the assassination from occurring, Jaqen gives the Waif permission to hunt down Arya.\n\nWhile pacing the atrium of the House of Black and White, Jaqen notices blood on the ground. He follows the trail to the Hall of Faces, where the trail stops at a new face on the wall, that of the Waif. Arya sneaks up behind him and points Needle at him. Jaqen does not offer resistance, and even walks into the sword's point. Though she rejects the tenets of the Faceless Men and reclaims her identity, Jaqen is pleased with her conduct by fully deeming her \"no one\", and allows her to leave.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jaqen_H%27ghar"}}

Martin made it a point to have several characters with the same name, because this happened in real life; it would be implausible to say that Robert Baratheon was the only person named \"Robert\" on an entire continent. Noble families in particular frequently re-use a small set of names, as children are named to honor famous ancestors, relatives, or major allies (i.e., Robert Arryn is named in honor of Robert Baratheon, his father's great ally, as is Robb Stark). One of the reasons Martin wrote the A Song of Ice and Fire novels is because he grew so frustrated with writing for television and film, in which budget constraints and audience attention span are a limiting factor. As Martin explained:"],"name":"Robin Arryn","description":"For the bulk of his life, Robin was shamelessly spoiled by his delusional, paranoid mother, and this resulted in him possessing few of the traits expected of the heir to a powerful noble house; aside from showing precious little tact or other courtly social skills, Robin became extremely temperamental, prone to hysterical fits and violent tempers. He also appears hugely entertained by the prospect of throwing prisoners and enemies through the Moon Door, giggling and clapping excitedly when it was opened for Tyrion Lannister. In that same vein, he appeared disappointed when robbed of the opportunity to see Tyrion executed. These traits do not make Robin psychopathic or sadistic to the standards of Joffrey Baratheon or Ramsay Bolton; he simply felt safe knowing that he could just send any problem that came his way plummeting to its death. Lysa's unnatural doting over her son did not go unnoticed by the boy\u2019s father Jon Arryn, who was only obstructed from doing anything about it by Lysa's extreme overprotectiveness.\n\nBy the time he meets Sansa Stark, Robin appears to have improved very minutely, but still maintains his capacity for tantrums, throwing an impractical temper when Sansa accused him of ruining her snow-built Winterfell (he believed it had already been ruined simply on the basis that it didn't have a Moon Door), not accounting for the fact that Winterfell was her home and the one place she yearned to be. Petyr Baelish observed that the strike she dealt him during the argument was something his mother should have administered a long time ago.\n\nRobin seems to have a limited vocabulary \u2013 he refers to executions as seeing people fly \u2013 and appears to be intellectually stunted, incapable of long-term logical thinking because he never truly had to face difficult decisions in his life. He is often easily distracted, shows little sense of resolve, and struggles to come to conclusions that were logically and ethically obvious to everyone else (such as helping Sansa during the impeding battle with Ramsay Bolton).  \n\nBecause of Lysa's prolonged, unnatural doting, Robin is also weak, sickly, and overall physically impaired for a boy his age. While training under Lord Royce at Runestone, Robin was shown to be hopeless with a sword, and even after prolonged training he still can't even strike the widest ring on an archery target, struggling to hold a bow stably in his hands. By contrast, even Joffrey could handle a sword better than Robin could (which is saying a great deal). However, while under Royce's care, Robin appears to have matured, even if only a little. Even through Petyr Baelish's manipulations, he decides against throwing Royce through the Moon Door (which he now refers to as \"throwing through the Moon Door\" instead of \"making him fly\"), even though it is one of his favorite things to watch. Robin also agreed with Littlefinger to send Vale troops for Sansa and Jon Snow's war effort against the Boltons on the basis that Sansa is his cousin, showing that he has at least some semblance of family honor (albeit not particularly caring about the result of the war, flicking his hand dismissively).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Robin_Arryn"}}

He was succeeded by his only son, Edmure Tully. As Edmure was unmarried at the time of Hoster's death, Catelyn Stark and Lysa Arryn were the heirs to Riverrun until a child would be born to Edmure through his arranged marriage with Roslin Frey.\n\nFollowing the Red Wedding, Walder Frey imprisons Edmure and kills Catelyn, but their uncle Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully escapes and heads back to Riverrun. Walder Frey gloats that Tywin Lannister intends to reward him for the betrayal by making a Frey the new Lord of Riverrun, but it is unknown if Brynden and the surviving Tully garrison at Riverrun will accept this without a fight.\n\nRallying the remnants of the Tully armies still loyal to his house, Lord Brynden is able to retake Riverrun from the Freys and their Lannister allies. He takes command of the castle as the de-facto Lord of Riverrun and digs in for a siege. Lord Petyr Baelish informs Sansa Stark of this development and Sansa dispatches Brienne of Tarth and her squire Podrick Payne to secure help from the Blackfish in retaking Winterfell from Ramsay Bolton.\n\nEmbarrassed by the loss of Riverrun and facing rebellion in the Riverlands, Lord Walder orders his sons Lothar Frey and Black Walder to retake the castle. To force Lord Brynden's surrender, Walder orders them to take Lord Edmure, the rightful Lord of Riverrun, with them as hostage. Acting as de-facto Lord of Riverrun, Brynden rejects the Freys' demands and calls their bluff when Black Walder fails to carry out his threat to execute his nephew Edmure. Later, Brynden parleys with the Lannister commander Jaime Lannister and boasts that Riverrun has enough supplies to hold out for two years and that thousands of Lannisters and Freys would die for the hundreds inside his castle.\n\nUnder the auspices of Jaime, Brienne and Podrick enter the castle to parley with the Blackfish. Jaime agrees to let the Blackfish and his garrison evacuate the castle at night in order to assist Sansa and her half-brother Jon Snow. Brynden lacks the manpower to help the Starks and refuses to abandon his ancestral home. Later, Jaime convinces Edmure to end the siege by offering to spare the lives of the Tully garrison and to provide his son with a proper education. As an incentive, Jaime threatens to destroy Riverrun and catapult his son should he reject his terms. Accepting Jaime's terms, Edmure returns to the castle.\n\nLord Brynden tries to refuse Edmure admittance, believing it to be a Lannister ruse. However, the garrison heeds the demands of their liege Lord Edmure and admit him into the castle. Recognizing Edmure as the rightful Lord of Riverrun, they obey his orders to surrender the castle to the Lannisters and Freys. The Blackfish's protests are ignored and Edmure gives orders for his men to bind him and hand him over to the Lannisters. However, Brynden helps Brienne and Podrick to escape the castle before making a final stand against the Lannisters and Freys. Edmure is made a hostage of the Iron Throne and sent with his family to Casterly Rock.\n\nWhen Arya Stark, murders Walder Frey and all of his sons, the Lordship of Riverrun is uncertain.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lord_of_Riverrun"}}

Chuckling, Maggy relented and asked Cersei for a taste of her blood, handing her knife to cut her finger with. Cersei complied and Maggy then literally sucked some blood from the cut, as part of her blood magic. Maggy told Cersei that she could ask three questions, but mocked the prideful young girl that she wouldn't like the answers.\n\nMaggy let Cersei ask three questions. First, Cersei's father had promised that she would wed Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, and she wanted to know when they would marry. Maggy responded that she wouldn't marry \"the prince\" but she would marry \"the king\". Worried, Cersei used her second question to confirm that she would indeed be queen some day. Maggy confirmed that she would, but that in time she would be cast down by another, younger and more beautiful queen, who would take all she held dear. Third, Cersei asked if she and the king would have children. Maggy cryptically replied that the king would have 20 children, but Cersei would have only three. Cersei didn't think that made sense (not realizing that a king can have bastard children), but Maggy continued to say of her three children that gold would be their crowns - and gold their burial shrouds, implying that all of Cersei's children would predecease her.\n\nCersei remembers meeting Maggy right before her father's funeral, after he was murdered by her own brother Tyrion. Cersei is disturbed because her eldest son Joffrey has already died, poisoned at his own wedding to Margaery Tyrell, who will now marry her younger son Tommen and become the new queen, while her daughter Myrcella is in Dorne as a ward - and potential hostage - of Doran Martell, brother of the late Oberyn Martell.

Sporadic and unconnected mention was made of the Riverlands being ruled at one time or another by House Mudd, House Fisher, and House Justman (and also, House Blackwood and House Bracken each claim that they were kings at some point but the other rebelled against them). Only the World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) revealed the official history of the Riverlands. The \"Histories and Lore\" featurettes produced for Season 3 of the TV series stated that the River Kings who were conquered by the Storm Kings were House Mudd, but The World of Ice and Fire revealed that the Storm Kings actually conquered House Teague - it is unknown if later TV seasons will correct this error, or if the TV continuity will end up being simplified.\n\nAlternative titles used are \"King of the Rivers and Hills\", \"River Kings\", and \"King of the Trident\". \"King of the Rivers and Hills\" was a more formal title: sometimes local rulers only called themselves \"River King\", i.e. when rebellions broke out against the Stormlands, rebel leaders would call themselves \"River Kings\", etc.\n\nAs revealed in The World of Ice and Fire, the actual order of Riverlands dynasties was:\n\nnull\n\nDuring the time of the First Men, Westeros was divided into hundreds of small petty kingdoms, with each local lord calling himself a \"king\". The Riverlands were no exception. Over time these lordships aggregated into larger petty kingdoms, about a dozen or so in each major geographical region, in a time known as the \"Age of a Hundred Kingdoms\". Eventually even these started aggregating into larger kingdoms resembling those of later times, but soon afterwards the Andals began their invasion of Westeros, about 6,000 years ago.\n\nThe history of the Riverlands before the Andal invasion is particularly murky, even compared to other regions of Westerlands. The ancestors of many noble Houses once called themselves petty kings, such as how House Bolton once ruled a small independent kingdom in the eastern portions of what later became \"the North\", before being conquered by the kings of House Stark from their west. The problem is that every petty king in the Riverlands often claimed overlordship over all of the Riverlands, even though they de facto only controlled their own local lordship. At times they would be able to expand to control larger portions of their neighbor's lands to make these claims closer to reality, only to see them shrink, but they are remembered by their descendants as having always ruled what they held only at their maximum extent. House Blackwood claim to have been kings of all the Riverlands at one point, until their rivals House Bracken revolted against them - while the Brackens make the contradicting claim that they were kings first, and the Blackwoods revolted against them. Both probably called themselves \"king\" of their own local regions at some point or another. Many agree that one of the earliest powerful First Men dynasties in the Riverlands was House Fisher - though it is unclear if they ruled all of the Riverlands or just a sizable portion of it. Many think the Fishers were the first large dynasty to call themselves \"King of the Rivers and Hills\", though some sources say they were the second, and others say they were the third.\n\nWhatever the case, what is clear is that the last First Men dynasty to rule in the Riverlands was House Mudd, and it was also the greatest by far compared to any of its predecessors. Instead of aspirational claims of overlordship, the Mudds actually ruled all of the Riverlands from the Trident north to the Neck (but not between the Neck and Gods Eye lake). House Mudd ruled from Oldstones on the Blue Fork. The Mudds ruled for many centuries, and they were the dynasty ruling the Riverlands 6,000 years ago when the Andals first began to arrive in Westeros in the Vale. Very soon they began attacking the the Riverlands as well: the Trident's multiple large and easily navigable tributaries provided the perfect highways for Andal longships to advance up, and move on to the interior. Under King Tristifer IV Mudd, \"the Hammer of Justice\", they resisted the Andal Invasion. Tristifer IV was said to have been victorious in ninety nine battles, but was defeated at his hundreth, in which seven Kings banded against him. Under his successor, King Tristifer V, House Mudd fell to the Andals.\n\nHouse Tully never claimed to be kings at any point in their entire history, not even petty kings of their local holdings. The original Ser Edmure Tully was a retainer of Tristifer IV Mudd, but after the Mudds were defeated the Tullys submitted to the Andal conquerors and intermarried with them. In return for their services the new Andal local kings granted them lands at the point where the Red Fork of the Trident River meets its tributary the Tumblestone River, and there they raised the castle Riverrun. It was strategically very important because it guarded the western marches against invasion from the Lannisters. The Tullys were always important vassals for subsequent dynasties, but they never came to rule the region until the Targaryen Conquest.\n\nThe Andals who conquered the Riverlands did not unify it, however, but carved it up into their own petty kingdoms which lasted for several centuries. Eventually, the Andal-controlled Riverlands were unified by a great warrior named Benedict Waters - a bastard scion of a tryst between a Blackwood and Bracken. He united the River Lords, and when at peace ruled so well and wisely that men called him Benedict the Just - he took a liking to the name, and renamed his new dynasty House Justman. The Justmans ruled the Riverlands for three centuries, and indeed were the first who truly unified all of what were later known as \"the Riverlands\": while the Mudds had ruled everything north of the Red Fork of the Trident, the Justmans not only controlled this but also expanded their domains south to the Blackwater Rush. They even conquered to the east, incorporating Duskendale and Rosby into their kingdom (the region of the future Crownlands). The Justmans later fell, however, during the great wave of ironborn expansion led by Qhored Hoare - he did not conquer the Riverlands outright, but he personally killed the last Justman king's heirs, ending their line. With no clear successor, the last Justman king's death was followed by one hundred years of civil war and anarchy, as various local lords vied to become the new king. At the end of this conflict the Riverlands were reunified by an adventurer named Torrence Teague, a man of no clear birth. He rose to prominence in the chaotic civil wars, then in a daring attack against the Westerlands seized enough gold to hire a sellsword army with which to lead a conquest of the rest of the Riverlands.\n\nHouse Teague therefore came to power a century after Qhored Hoare lived, but Qhored Hoare actually lived before the Andals invaded the Iron Islands. The discrepancy is easy to reconcile: the Iron Islands were the last region of Westeros that the Andals invaded, only about 4,000 years ago - and thus 2,000 years after the initial Andal invasion into the Riverlands (which is stated to have been one of their earlier conquests). House Greyiron ruled the Iron Islands for one thousand years before the Andals came, and when they did invade the Hoares intermarried with the Andals to become the new ruling dynasty. Therefore if the Andals destroyed House Mudd about 6,000 years ago, the fall of House Justman and rise of House Teague must have occurred no later than 5,000 years ago.\n\nHouse Teague continued to rule the Riverlands for about five thousand years - though they were constantly beset by invasion from without and rebellion from within. The notoriously fractious River Lords did not forget past grudges, and also frequently allied with outside invaders. Moreover, the other major kingdoms in Westeros were by this time coalescing into large, strong realms on each of their borders: the Gardeners unified the Reach to their southwest, the Lannisters unified the Westerlands, the Starks unified the North, the Arryns unified the Vale to the east, and the Durrandons unified the Stormlands to the southeast - all eager for conquest. Thus while \"House Teague\" technically lasted for several thousand years, many branches were snuffed out in constant invasions and rebellions, not to mention civil wars between rival branches of the family. Their kingdom was never powerful.\n\nFinally, nearly 400 years before the Targaryen Conquest, House Teague was defeated by House Durrandon of the Stormlands. King Humfrey Teague, a very pious ruler, had attempted to stamp out worship of the Old Gods of the Forest in his domains, causing House Blackwood to rise up in revolt, who were joined by other lords who had separate grievances against the Teagues. Lord Roderick Blackwood was tied by marriage to Storm King Arlan III Durrandon, who had wed one of his daughters, and the host of the Stormlands invaded the Riverlands to support their rebellion. In the final battle of the campaign Humfrey I was slain, at which his eldest son took up his father's crown and sword, only to be killed in turn, at which the crown was taken up by the next eldest son. The battle lasted for hours, and in that time the crown passed to no less than four of Humfrey's sons, before the last was slain. For this reason, combined with the presence of Arlan III, it became remembered as the \"Battle of Six Kings\". Arlan III had intended (according to his chroniclers) to make Roderick Blackwood the new king of the Riverlands, but he died in the campaign, and his young son was only an eight year old boy unfit to rule, so Arlan decided to just add the territories of the Riverlands to his own kingdom.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/King_of_the_Rivers_and_Hills"}}

He is a fierce, ruthless warrior and a highly effective general. He is the father of Samwell Tarly and a younger son, Dickon, and at least one daughter, Talla.\n\nAlong with his liege-lord Mace Tyrell, Randyll fought on the Targaryen side during Robert's Rebellion. He commanded the royalist victory at the Battle of Ashford, the only defeat that Robert Baratheon ever suffered in the entire war.\n\nSamwell recounts to Jon Snow that even though he was his father's eldest son and heir, he was disgusted with Samwell's \"womanly\" interest in books and learning and disdain for martial valor and combat. Soon before Sam turned eighteen, his father took him aside and bluntly told him that he was unworthy to inherit the Tarly lands and titles. Randyll ordered Sam to take the black and join the Night's Watch. Randyll told his son that if he did not, he would take him out on a hunt in the woods and kill him in such a way that it looked like an accident, apparently unconcerned of the fact that such an act would be considered kinslaying. Terrified, Sam did as he was bid and left Horn Hill for the Wall.\n\nAt Stannis Baratheon's war council, Davos Seaworth names Randyll Tarly amongst the many lords that have declared for Renly Baratheon.\n\nSamwell mentions his father by name when explaining the concept of family names to Gilly. When she points out that Randyll is a handsome name, he asks her to please not give it to her newborn son.\n\nSam quips to Gilly that his father is not a very \"literary man\". Later, surprised that Samwell is Randyll's son, Stannis Baratheon recounts to Sam how Lord Randyll defeated Robert Baratheon in the Battle of Ashford \u2014 the only battle Robert ever lost, for which King Stannis considers Randyll a fine soldier.\n\nSince the Citadel only allows men within its walls, Samwell decides to send Gilly and her baby Sam to live with his family at Horn Hill. While Sam admits that he does not get on well with his father Randyll, he reassures Gilly that his mother and sister are nice. When Sam and Gilly arrive at Horn Hill, Randyll assumes she is a prostitute from Mole's Town, something that he manages to come to terms with. Gilly is dressed in southern clothes, and she, Sam, Randyll, Dickon, Melessa, and Talla all have dinner together. At the table, Randyll repeatedly berates Sam: he insults his weight, tells him the Night's Watch failed to make a man out of him, and says he will never be a great warrior, or inherit Heartsbane, the Tarly family's ancestral Valyrian steel sword. Gilly rushes to defend him, telling Randyll that Sam killed a Thenn and a White Walker on his way down to Castle Black. By saying this, she lets slip that she is in fact a wildling, a group of people who Randyll apparently considers to be subhuman. Randyll's bigotry, particularly when just used as another way to insult Sam, is the last straw for Melessa, who storms out of the hall with Gilly and Talla, declaring that it isn't Sam who is dishonoring House Tarly. Randyll then says he'll let Gilly stay and work in the kitchens, and even will acknowledge Little Sam as a bastard of the House. However, upon his departure the following morning, Sam will never be allowed at Horn Hill again.\n\nSam decides not to leave Gilly and her son at Horn Hill and silently departs with them in the night. Before leaving the castle, Sam steals Heartsbane. Gilly is worried that Randyll will come after them - not for his son but for his sword - to which Sam replies that Randyll can \"bloody well try\".\n\nRandyll travels to King's Landing at the request on Cersei Lannister, the new Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Cersei implores Randyll, and the other lords of the Reach to pledge fealty to House Lannister in order to defend Westeros from Daenerys Targaryen and her combined army of Dothraki and Unsullied. Jaime speaks to Randyll alone and claims that Randyll is the most prominent of the lords of the Reach, and that the others will look to him when choosing sides. Randyll is reluctant to ally with the house that orchestrated the Red Wedding and break his oath to House Tyrell.\n\nJaime reminds Randyll of his oath to the crown, appeals to his xenophobia reminding him that Olenna Tyrell is bringing savages and eunuchs to Westeros and promises him the title of Warden of the South. Despite his initial objections, Randyll eventually sides with the Lannisters and, together with Jaime Lannister and Bronn, leads the main part of the 10,000 men strong Lannister army against Highgarden where they easily take and loot the castle, killing Olenna Tyrell in the process.The prisoners of war are being herded by the Dothraki to Daenerys and Drogon behind her, waiting menacingly. Daenerys appeals to them, bringing up the rumours spread about her by Queen Cersei, and warnings of brutality that the dragon Queen would bring - burning down homes, and murdering families. She assures she is not here to murder, but to destroy the wheel of power that rolls over the rich and poor alike, to no one's benefit but people like Cersei Lannister. She offers them a choice - bend the knee and join her in her quest to make the world a better place than ever before, or refuse and die. Tyrion looks at her apprehensively upon hearing this, most of the soldiers kneel immediately, intimidated by Drogon. Most- except for Randyll Tarly, his son Dickon, and well as a handful of men. Daenerys summons Randyll forward, but his insists he already has a Queen. Tyrion recalls he didn't pledge to Cersei until recently, and that she murdered the rightful Queen, destroying House Tyrell for good. He observes Randyll's allegiances are questionable to which Randyll answers there are no easy choices in war. He reminds Tyrion that Cersei is at least a true Westerosi, and that Tyrion is a kinslayer, having killed his father, as well as supporting a foreigner; bringing savages to their continent. Daenerys accepts his answer, and prepares to carry out a sentence, but Tyrion intervenes with the possibility of sending Randyll to the Wall, instead of death. Randyll affirms Daenerys cannot send him to the Wall as she is not his Queen.\n\nDaenerys signals for three Dorthraki men to apprehend him, but Dickon suddenly speaks up insisting he will have to be killed too. Randyll, horrified, tells his son to shut up. Tyrion reminds Dickon that he is the future of House Tarly, and insists that he better bend the knee, reminding him how what happened to House Tyrell, which Randyll silently nods in agreement so his son may be spared. Dickon refuses to relent his decision, thereby Tyrion proposes to Daenerys about having them committed to the cells instead, but Daenerys, being ruthless but pragmatic, does not wish to grant the reputation of putting traitors in chains, or many would take advantage. She resumes to carry out the sentence for them both, as they hold hands. Drogon unleashes his dragonfire, roasting Randyll and Dickon alive and reducing them both to flame and ash in seconds, killing them instantly. Terrified, the remaining soldiers kneel as Tyrion reflects uneasily over the execution.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Randyll_Tarly"}}

After her second nameday, Their mother left Sylvi wrapped in furs in the forest to die, but Cotter came to her aid and they left the village.\n\nCotter and his fellow Free Folk were searching for weapons south of the Wall, Cotter got caught, however he successfully managed to pretend he was one of the smallfolk and was sent to the Wall. He claims he stole potatoes for his sister as the reason why he was sent to the Wall.\n\nIt's implied since arriving at the Wall, Cotter has had to spend a deal of time with Finn, already exhibiting frustration at Finn's habit of \"bragging about all the girl's he's fucked\".\n\nWhen Gared Tuttle arrives at the Wall, he soon meets his brothers-in-training, Finn and Cotter, the three of them being trained by Frostfinger. Finn and Cotter both reveal why they were sent to the Wall and argue during Frostfinger's speech. During training, Cotter accidentally shoots himself in the toe with an arrow from his crossbow when he fails to reload it. Finn laughs at this and to get back at him, Cotter pick-pockets Finn's dagger.\n\nWhen Finn realizes the dagger is missing he blames and attacks Cotter, Gared is caught in the middle and ends up fighting Finn. Frostfinger is angry and explains the last thief he caught had his fingers chopped off. A man searches Cotter but finds nothing, as Gared leaves with Jon Snow, Cotter reveals he still has the dagger - hidden up his sleeve.\n\nAt the wall, Frostfinger assigns the new recruits positions in the Watch. If Gared defended Cotter, the latter will be pleased with him while Finn will be annoyed. Frostfinger tells the recruits that Finn and Gared are to be Rangers, while Cotter becomes a Builder. He tells the northerners to follow his lead to a weirwood tree beyond the Wall to take their vows.\n\nOn the way to the tree, Jon is glad to see that Gared will become a ranger, but suggests he make up with whichever brother he scorned during the debacle with Finn's knife - if he snitched on Cotter, he will have to make up with him.

Cotter reveals that he took the North Grove map from him, while Finn walks off because of his disbelief of the North Grove, dismissing the grove as a children's story, but Cotter invites Gared into a quieter space and tells him he can help him find the Grove - Finn doesn't know how to sneak past giants or deal with Mammoths, but Cotter does because he is from the lands above the Wall; he is a Wildling who was caught stealing weapons below the Wall and passed himself off as a local. He begs Gared to keep his secret and in return he'll help him desert the Watch to find the North Grove.\n\nCotter helps Gared escape his cell early in the episode, and leads him out of Castle Black, hanging back while Gared makes more daring maneuvers. The two encounter Finn if Gared made friends with him in the previous episode, Gared gets the choice to bring Finn along or refuse to. They then desert the Night's Watch.\n\nA while after, Gared and Cotter (also Finn depending on your choices) run into a few Wildlings.

Sylvi tells her brother that they must go south to join Mance Rayder. She refuses to go to the North Grove and Cotter says that he's come a long way. Gared can try to convince Cotter to convince Sylvi, but it doesn't work and Cotter says that maybe Sylvi is right. He is later seen yelling for help as the Wights attack.

But by the time he\u2019d earned enough links on his chain to graduate from acolyte, Jon Arryn had been murdered and the South was in turmoil. The Citadel ultimately assigned Maester Ortengryn to Ironrath, where he soon came to respect the Forrester family\u2019s honor and integrity. He now serves the Forresters with pride and has become a trusted advisor to Lord Gregor.\n\nOrtengryn's links in his chain are gold for money and accounting, and silver for medicine and healing.\n\nOrtengryn is first seen in the great hall when Gared Tuttle, the squire of Lord Forrester, arrives in Ironrath after escaping the Red Wedding. Ortengryn treats Gared's wounds with maggots from an encounter with Bolton and Whitehill men, which results in a leg wound for Gared and the death of one Bolton and potentially one Whitehill soldier. He converses with Gared, giving him condolences for the death of Gared's family, and explaining the implications of Gared's justice for his family, such as Lord Ludd Whitehill demanding justice for the 'murder' of the men. He expresses regret for the death of Gregor and Rodrik Forrester, and Lady Elissa Forrester and Talia Forrester then enter the great hall, wanting to see Gared. After Talia has a brief conversation with Gared, Ortengryn sends her off to bed. He then asks Gared to tell Lady Forrester the final moments of Gregor and Rodrik. When Gared presents the Forrester greatsword, to Ortengryn and Elissa, which Ortengryn promises to give to Lord Ethan.\n\nOrtengryn is later seen climbing one of the towers of Ironrath with Ethan, discussing the doubt of some members of the Forrester household of his leadership. He motivates Ethan, telling him of his ancestors contributions to the house, such as Thorren and Gerhard, and his own father. He then tells of the Forrester tradition of selecting a Sentinel, the lord's most trusted advisor. They are interrupted however by Royland Degore, who has found a Forrester soldier, Erik, stealing weapons.\n\nAfter Ethan makes the decision on the fate of Erik, Ortengryn comforts him. He notes that a Sentinel could help him in a situation like that, and that there are two capable men for that role: Ser Royland or Duncan Tuttle. He then gives Ethan the Bracer of the Sentinel, and advises him to make a decision for the Sentinel at Ethan's first small council meeting. At the meeting, he states Ethan has made his decision and that only one can be it. After your Sentinel is picked, and the council is discussing Ramsay Snow's impeding visit to Ironrath. Ortengryn notes that the Bolton needs the Forresters to harvest ironwood. He also devises a plan for peace by giving the Boltons ironwood for protection. You can choose his plan to deal with Ramsay in the meeting. He is not present at the meeting, however, although Talia does call him for as Ethan is on the ground after being stabbed in the neck by Ramsay.\n\nWhen Rodrik Forrester falls from the corpse cart, Ser Royland Degore calls for someone to fetch the maester, and Rodrik goes back unconscious. Rodrik wakes from his unconsciousness temporarily, to see the maester having surgery on him, with Ortengryn's hands bloody and using blades to cut stuff on Rodrik. He notices Rodrik's consciousness, and stops operating to offer the milk of the poppy to him, which he can refuse or accept. Lady Forrester and Duncan enter, with Ortengryn stating he's in a dedicate moment in the surgery. Nonetheless, Lady Forrester runs over to her son, while Ortengryn notes that Rodrik's wounds would have killed any other man and that if he cannot finish the surgery he may die, but if he lives he may never walk again. Rodrik slips back into unconsciousness from the milk of the poppy or the pain, which Ortengryn says before he does.\n\nLater, when Talia greets Rodrik now awake, she informs him that the maester believes Rodrik's leg may never fully heal.\n\nOrtengryn is the first of the small council to see Rodrik approaching, and stops their argument. Royland states that they are surprised he is walking, because the maester said it be weeks if he walked, at all. Rodrik can then say the maester doesn't know everything, Ortengryn then lowers his head. Later, when Duncan and Royland are arguing, Ortengryn tries to defuse the tensions, but to no avail. When discussing Rodrik's betrothal, he joins Duncan and Royland in surprise of Elaena Glenmore coming visit to Ironrath. As Royland and Duncan argue about how to deal with the garrison, the maester asks Rodrik to put an end to the tiresome dispute. Lady Forrester asks him to light the ironwood torches.\n\nWhen preparing for Lady Elaena's visit, Ortengryn redoes Rodrik's bandages. He also points out to Rodrik that he might wish to remind Elaena that in terms of lineage he was still very much a man and could produce an heir. Lady Forrester silences him before he can finish on these statements.\n\nThe maester isn't present at the funeral for Lord Gregor and Lord Ethan.\n\nOrtengryn is present for the arrival of Gryff Whitehill at Ironrath. He later meets with the rest of the household in the ironwood grove to discuss the garrison. When Royland brings up taking action against Gryff, Ortengryn supports him, stating that his presence at Ironrath makes him easy to access. \n\nWhen Talia is brought into Ironrath's courtyard to be punished by Gryff for biting one of his men, Ortengryn is present in the crowd. If Rodrik resists Gryff, Ortengryn tries to intervene when Gryff crushes Rodrik's arm, saying that the Forrester lord could lose it if Gryff persists. He later reenters the Great Hall with the rest of the Forrester household.\n\nOrtengryn seemingly fails to properly treat the bite wound on the man Talia attacked, and is beaten by Gryff as punishment. Rodrik intervenes and commands Gryff to stop, to no avail. Rodrik then calls in the Glenmore Elite Guard, whom he had secured the assistance of earlier, and takes the Whitehills prisoner. Ortengryn is last seen being helped away by either Elissa or members of the guard.\n\nMaester Ortengryn appears just as Rodrik is about to leave for Ludd's camp, walking alongside Elaena Glenmore while trying to persuade her to flee to the Riverlands. It is up to the player to back up Ortengryn and tell Elaena to flee or back up Elaena and tell her to stay.\n\nIn the Codex after the final episode, it is shown that he was killed in the Battle of Ironrath.\n\nWhen Ludd arrives demanding the Forresters' surrender, Ortengryn hesitantly suggests that they accept his terms and stop the bloodshed, pointing out that their forces are massively outnumbered. This proves to be an unpopular opinion until Asher or Elissa suggest that they pretend to accept the terms in order to trick Ludd and then kill him. When everyone is debating which method to use to kill Ludd, Ortengryn seems to favour Beskha's idea of poisoning him, pointing out that he has a suitable toxin in his stores, although if Bloodsong was killed by Asher in Episode 5 he does argue that some would call it 'a coward's weapon' when she first suggests it.\n\nWhichever course of action Asher chose, Ortengryn is present in the Great Hall when the Whitehills arrive, and pours (ordinary) wine for some of the guests. When Asher leaves the Great Hall having been stabbed by Gwyn \/ a Whitehill soldier, Ortengryn insists on treating his wound but is told to take Elissa and Talia to safety.\n\nIn the Codex after the final episode, it is shown that he was killed in the Battle of Ironrath.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ortengryn"}}

In their temple - the House of Black and White - those who seek an end to suffering may drink poisoned water which grants a painless death.\n\nKilling for personal gain or out of anger or hate are forbidden to Faceless Men.\n\nAs the Faceless Men forsake their identities in the service of the Many-Faced God, they only assassinate targets they have been hired to kill and may not choose who is worthy of the 'gift' by themselves.\n\nnull\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Faceless Men are based at the House of Black and White, a temple in Braavos dedicated to the \"Many-Faced God\" that everyone will face, a reference to death. While they are indeed a guild of assassins, they have philosophical and religious motivations that will lead them to rejecting commissions that clash with those motivations.\n\nThe Faceless Men are a fairly old organization, predating even the Doom of Valyria. Their founders were slaves who worked in the mines under the Fourteen Fires, the great volcanic mountain chain whose eruption destroyed the Valyrian Freehold four centuries ago. The thousands of slaves from a hundred different lands faced death on a daily basis, and over time, the belief developed among some of them that while they came from many different lands and followed many different religions, all of these religions were fundamentally the same, because they all worshiped death in some fashion. They were either polytheistic religions that had a god devoted to death, or monotheistic religions with a deity that had dominion over death. In time this turned into a syncretic belief system worshiping the Many-Faced God of Death: holding that Death has appeared to humans under many different faces as many different gods, but they are all fundamentally one god.\n\nThe organization actually predates Braavos itself. They started out by giving the \"gift\" of death to slaves who were suffering particularly horribly in the mines, to ease their pain and in time, they learned to surreptitiously give the \"gift\" to some of their Valyrian masters as well, becoming skilled assassins. Many centuries later, the surviving Faceless Men relocated to Braavos, which was founded by ex-slaves who had escaped from Valyria (though whether this was after or slightly before the Doom is unclear).\n\nThe Faceless Men charge exorbitant fees, but their reputation for success is unmatched. The cost increases relative to the importance of the target and the difficulty of the objective. In the first book it is said that hiring a Faceless Man to kill Daenerys Targaryen would cost more than it would to hire an entire army. Further, the Faceless Men will reject a contract if killing the target clashes with their strange, and at times inscrutable, religious beliefs. Conversely, sometimes they choose bizarre \"payments\" according to what they feel is due. Sometimes, if a powerful lord asks them to kill the child of one of his enemies, the Faceless Men give as their \"price\" that in return they will kill the lord's own child (the lord can reject this, but it also means rejecting the entire contract).\n\nTheir fee is for a precise assassination, and the death of anyone other than the intended target is avoided whenever possible. They usually go so far as to try to make their assassinations look like accidents, adding to the mystery surrounding their order. For example, in the TV series, Jaqen kills the Tickler by sneaking up, snapping his neck, and then throwing him off a castle wall and then slipping away, leaving witnesses unsure if he was actually murdered. Jaqen did kill Amory Lorch with a poison dart, but only because he was pressed for time to kill him immediately.\n\nFaceless Men aren't complete shapeshifters, i.e. they can't violate the law of conservation of mass and suddenly grow drastically taller or shorter, though they can dramatically change their appearance within these parameters. Either men or women can become \"Faceless Men\". The abilities of Faceless Men are not genetic or limited to a specific race: anyone can become a Faceless Man with the proper training in the arcane knowledge of their order. It is debatable whether the abilities of the Faceless Men could be considered \"magic\": They use a variety of tools, potions, and special training to shapeshift, rather than outright incantations and spells.\n\nIn the novels, it is implied that Euron Greyjoy hired a Faceless Man to kill his brother Balon. Euron admits he did not kill Balon by his own hands, but does not specify who did.\n\nThe Faceless Men are based on the Assassins, an Islamic Shia secret society that was active in the Middle East during the 11th to 13th centuries.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Faceless_Men"}}

However their fathers Gregor Forrester and Ludd Whitehill, bitter rivals found out and bloodshed ensured between the two rival houses, and Asher was exiled across the Narrow Sea to Essos, ending their relationship. Unlike her father and younger brother Gwyn has a more caring side and is not arrogant, selfish and greedy like Ludd and Gryff.\n\nGwyn does not appear in Iron From Ice but her name can be first seen on the codex page. \n\nGwyn appears in this episode if Ryon is not brought back to Ironrath for his father's and brother's funeral. She comes to Ironrath by her own accord, and wishes to speak to Lord Rodrik. She lets him know that she is looking after Ryon at Highpoint, and that he is worried he is forgotten about.\n\nIn this episode, Duncan tells Rodrik that Gwyn would like to speak to him away from her father. They ride out into the Ironwood forest traveling down a deforested path caused by Ludd to meet Gwyn. Gwyn finds Rodrik and pleads with him to put an end to the fighting with diplomacy and peace rather than bringing their houses to open war. She also tells Rodrik that the Whitehills know about the plan the Forrester small council decided upon and warns him that there is a traitor among his council. She then sneaks off into the forest before a group of Whitehill men find them.\n\nGwyn is first seen in Highpoint and welcomes Rodrik, Elissa Forrester, Duncan\/Royland and the Glenmore soldiers lead by Arthur (if Rodrik chose to bring them) to Highpoint and thanked them for accepting her father's invitation, while she guides them to the dining hall, depending on the player's choices she will either thank Rodrik for putting up with Gryff and expresses sympathy for how hard it was, or will be upset by Rodrik standing up to Gryff and warns them her father will play it his own way. She introduces the histories of Highpoint and Ironrath, who were once close as well as the Whitehill's family portrait to her guests. When she arrives at the dining hall she notices that Ludd has not arrived yet, puzzled, she leaves the dining hall to search for her father while leaving Rodrik and the others alone with the Whitehill soldiers.\n\nShortly after she and her father arrive from the upper floors, both Whitehills and the Forresters sat down and start to discuss about ironwood business. Ludd will be upset by Rodrik's thoughts on the business regardless of what choice the player makes, and told Gwyn that his behavior not worth putting up with, Gwyn patiently tells her father to give Rodrik some time. When Rodrik reveals that Gryff is imprisoned, much to the Whitehills' shock, he offers a trade for Ryon. Ludd will grab his tool from the table with Gwyn staring at him, he calls out to bring the boy and suddenly holds a tool to Ryon's cheek, shocking everyone who happens to be in the hall, Gwyn begs her father and tries to calm everyone down by saying 'This is not what we agreed' but in vain, Ludd will rebuff by saying that it's on Rodrik and not him.\n\nAfter Ludd shows mercy to Ryon, and orders the Forresters to leave the hall. Gwyn, unable to keep her promise to Rodrik about offering a truce to the Forresters, is greatly upset by her father's actions and apologizes to Rodrik as they leave.\n\nIf Rodrik is the surviving lord: Gwyn sends a Whitehill rider to Ironrath ahead of her father's army to warn Rodrik of their approach. She does not physically appear in the episode.\n\nIf Asher is the surviving lord: After Ludd Whitehill and his army arrive at Ironrath, he declared that according to Ramsay's terms and with the death of Rodrik, he has won the feud between their rival houses. He then asks for Asher's surrender, telling him that if he bends the knee, he will remain the Lord of Ironrath as his bannerman and will also marry Gwyn. Asher feigns acceptance of these terms, believing Ludd would \"Have his head\" the minute Gwyn produced an heir and instead plans to ambush or poison Ludd during the celebratory feast, setting the stage for the White Engagement.\n\nPrior to the feast, Gwyn enters Ironrath's great hall and asks to speak with Asher privately. She then tells her old lover that she knows him and had deduced that he is preparing something. Gwyn begs him not to destroy the new peace between their families and making it clear that she still loves him and they could control the future of their houses if they wed before leaving to meet up with her father and brother. Asher is then given the choice to call off the poisoning\/ambush.\n\nIf Asher decides to go through with poisoning Ludd or setting an ambush during the feast, Gwyn stabs him in the back during the ensuing fight, telling him that he destroyed the peace between their families and their future together, before fleeing Ironrath.\n\nIf Asher decides to call off the poisoning or the ambush after hearing Gwyn's plea for peace, Lady Forrester will get up abruptly after seeing Duncan\/Royland signaling the pit fighters to stop causing Ludd to get suspicious. Asher goes to try and reason with Elissa, Gwyn then asks if everything is okay and Asher tries to assure Ludd that he and Gwyn will wed as promised. Elissa yells that Asher has ruined their house by accepting Ludd's peace terms. Asher tries to calm his mother down but Elissa consumed with rage over the death of Rodrik slashes Ludd's face with a knife, setting off the cancelled ambush. After Asher battles and kills Gryff, a Whitehill soldier stabs him, but Gwyn kills the man, saving Asher. She remains frozen, in shock over how badly things turned out. Gwyn later escapes Ironrath, abandoning her family with Talia and finds a badly wounded Asher in the ironwood forest, promising him that they will overcome their situation abandoning her family to be with Asher because she believed he tried to do the right thing by calling off the ambush\/poisoning.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gwyn_Whitehill"}}

Gregor married Elissa Branfield, a daughter of Southron Targaryen loyalists, before Robert Baratheon seized the Iron Throne Gregor ascended to the lordship after his father died at the Trident, and has led House Forrester for sixteen years.\n\nHe is the father of six healthy children borne by Elissa Forrester: Rodrik, Asher, Mira, Ethan, Talia and Ryon.\n\nIt was later revealed that Gregor also fathered two secret bastards, Josera Snow and Elsera Snow. He sent them to the North Grove for unknown reasons. Their mother's identity is unknown and none of his family are aware of their existence.\n\nOne day, while supplicating at Ironrath, Duncan Tuttle struck up an unlikely friendship with Gregor, the then heir to House Forrester. The two grew close, sharing food, drink, and women, and when Gregor became lord he named Duncan his castellan. . After seeing his exploits in the Greyjoy Rebellion, Lord Forrester asked Ser Royland Degore to serve as Ironrath's master-at-arms.\n\nAt the Tourney at Lannisport, Gregor met Tyrion Lannister, and the two struck up a brief conversation, during which Tyrion found him very honorable, and even then he didn't trust Roose Bolton.\n\nHis son Asher had always been a rebellious youth, finding ways to raise his father's ire. But his life took a dark turn when, at age seventeen, he fell in love with Gwyn Whitehill, the eldest daughter of his father's bitter rival Ludd Whithill. Bloodshed ensued and Lord Forrester faced a grim choice: go to war, or exile Asher across the Narrow Sea. He chose the latter. He privately named that event his life's only regret.\n\nAfter Robb Stark called his banners to war, Lord Forrester asked Rodrik to stay behind and protect Ironrath; but Rodrik would have none of it. Instead, he rode off at his father's side and led the Forrester cavalry with such valor that his name came to be feared amongst the ranks of Lannister soldiers.  When the war began, Ryon was too young to understand why Rodrik and his father were leaving home.  Duncan's nephew Gared Tuttle, began to work in Lord Forrester's stables, rising through the ranks to be eventually named his squire. Gared has served Lord Forrester through the long months in King Robb's army.\n\nLord Forrester is present at the Red Wedding. Gared cleans his sword, the ancestral Forrester greatsword. He is first seen emerging from his tent after hearing of Norren and Thermund discussing Norren's hand in the capture of Jaime Lannister. He asks Thermund if he's questioning Norren's honor, which Thermund replies he's questioning Norren's story that grows more far-fetched every time he tells it. Lord Forrester joins in the laughter and picks up an empty cup. Gared fetches the wine for him, which Gregor pours himself. Gregor than speaks about Norren's loyal family, his honor, and how House Tully is forever in his debt, because they've never seen field so well plowed the day the Kingslayer dragged Norren across the battlefield. The Forrester men join in laughter. Gregor pours some wine for Gared, and toasts to Robb Stark, the King in the North, and informs the men that when they march on Casterly Rock, House Forrester will lead the vanguard.\n\nLord Forrester pulls Gared aside and asks him to find Rodrik, as men find courage at the bottom of their cups. He notes Gared as been his squire for several years and asks what he wants for his loyalty. He then offers for Gared to ride in the vanguard along Rodrik's side as an equal of any man who serves House Forrester. He also wishes for Gared to keep it between them because he doesn't want the other squires discouraged.  The slaughter begins after Gared goes to get wine along with Bowen. Gared either saves Bowen or runs to warn Lord Forrester. He finds Rodrik, and sees him be presumably killed. He returns to camp to find Thermund dead, and Lord Forrester and Norren fighting the Freys. Gregor asks what happened to Rodrik, and is saddened at his supposed demise. Three Frey men approach, and Lord Forrester saves Gared's life, but is then hit by a crossbow bolt. He curses Walder Frey, and Norren advises him to flee with Gared. He complies, and Norren runs back into the fray.\n\nAfter retreating from the battle with Gared, he drops to his knees, proclaiming he is too injured to continue. He orders his squire to return to Ironrath with the Forrester greatsword, and to deliver the message that \"The North Grove must never be lost.\" to Gared's uncle Duncan.  Lord Gregor then stands up and tells Gared to run as two Frey soldiers approach. Gregor draws his ax and prepares to defend himself. Lord Forrester manages to grab one one of the soldiers' swords and attempts to wrestle in from him, but is quickly stabbed through the chest by the other Frey. Gared looks in shock as his lord collapses to the ground, and flees into the forest.\n\nLord Forrester's lifeless body is seen on a corpse cart along with several other bodies, including his son, Rodrik who has somehow managed to survive the slaughter of the Freys.  His corpse is later seen on an ironwood casket, along with his third-born son Ethan, who perished at the hands of Ramsay Snow. The funeral is held for Lord Forrester and his son Ethan. His first-born Rodrik reads a eulogy for his deceased father and brother and his second-born daughter Talia performs a song she wrote in the days leading up to his wake.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gregor_Forrester"}}

His mother was the first child and daughter of Viserys I Targaryen, who did not change the succession of the Iron Throne upon the birth of his sons. This therefore made Joffrey fourth in line for the throne. When his grandfather died, his uncle was named Aegon II Targaryen, on the orders of his step-grandmother Alicent Hightower. When Rhaenyra heard the news, the Dance of the Dragons began. By this time, Laenor had presumably died and Jacaerys' mother had remarried her uncle Daemon Targaryen, and had two sons with him. By the time his mother sat on the Iron Throne, his older brothers had both died at the hands of the Greens, and she was not popular among the Smallfolk, who started to rebel against her. A certain follower of the faith, The Shepherd, declared that the dragons were demons and claimed that that they ruled this world. Pointing to the Dragonpit, he signaled to attack it and kill the dragons. This ended with the death of all four dragons in the pit, including the destruction of it. Joffrey, who watched the violence from the Red Keep, mounted his mother's dragon, Syrax, still thinking that he could save the dragons. However, Syrax did not understand Joffrey's intentions, and in stead of flying to the ruins of the Dragonpit, he moved erratically to be free of him, until he was. Joffrey fell from him, to his death. Mourning for her son, Rhaenyra decided to sail back to Dragonstone, Joffrey's death signaling that Rhaenyra would never succeed as being a peaceful Queen.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Joffrey_Velaryon"}}

The practice is considered cruel in Westeros, where eunuchs are mistrusted; men are typically only castrated or gelded in the Seven Kingdoms as punishment for serious crimes such as rape. It may also be employed as a means of physical or psychological torture. However, it is considered acceptable in many parts of Essos, as part of the vibrant slave trade which exists in many areas. Slave-eunuchs are a common sight in Essos, and the famous warrior-eunuchs produced in Slaver's Bay known as the Unsullied are among the most disciplined soldiers in the known world."],"name":"Eunuchs","description":"Grand Maester Pycelle expresses distrust of and disgust with Varys, and is annoyed that a eunuch is serving on the king's small council. When discussing the death of Jon Arryn, Pycelle suggests that poison is a weapon typically used by women - and also eunuchs. He then bluntly notes that Varys is a eunuch, trying to throw suspicion on him.\n\nPetyr Baelish talks to Varys about his disfigurement as part of a verbal sparring match, asking where his testicles are located. He notes that Varys is from the Free Cities.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen travels to the slaver city of Astapor to buy an army of Unsullied, slave soldiers who have been turned into eunuchs to improve discipline. Lacking male organs, they do not take part in rapes.\n\nVarys explains the story of how he was emasculated to Tyrion Lannister.

When Balon receives the box, he is disgusted and gives Theon up for dead, stating that his son is not a man anymore, and is no longer important to him because he cannot further the Greyjoy line.\n\nnull\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, different regions are known to make eunuchs in different ways. Some only remove the testicles but leave the shaft of the penis intact, while others remove all external genitalia, both the penis and testicles. The slaver-city of Yunkai, for example, is known to make eunuchs by removing only a slave's testicles, but the slave-masters of Astapor make eunuchs by removing everything, penis and testes, such as when they make the Unsullied. A eunuch with only the testicles removed but not the penis will still lose the will to partake of sexual activity, but other slave-masters like to be sure by removing the penis as well.\n\nIn real life, if an adult man has his testicles removed, he can still achieve an erection. If a boy has his testicles removed before puberty, however, it is difficult to impossible for them to achieve an erection with the remaining shaft of the penis - due to the lack of hormones during the puberty years that would normally be supplied by the testicles. This is a moot point for the Unsullied: both their testicles and penis shaft are removed when they are no more than five years old. Kraznys actually explains within the novels that eunuchs can sometimes achieve an erection if they only have their testicles removed, so this is why the Astapori cut off all of the Unsullied's genitals, just to be sure.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Eunuchs"}}

Confronting her sister, Arya toys with Sansa, insisting that they play the \"game of faces\", hoping to catch her in a lie and rat out her disloyalty to Jon. Sansa, unwilling to play, instead insists that Arya explain the nature of her faces. Arya reveals that with the faces, she can be whomever she wants to be. Grasping her Valyrian steel catspaw dagger, she approaches her sister in a somewhat threatening manner, wondering aloud what it might feel like to wear pretty silk dresses and be the Lady of Winterfell should she take Sansa's face. Arya then hands her the dagger and promptly heads out the door, leaving her sister visibly disturbed.","Even before she left Winterfell, Arya showed promising skills in martial pursuits such as archery, being able to hit a target from a large distance. Eventually, after receiving training from Syrio Forel and later from the Faceless Men, Arya increased her skills tremendously, being able to master the water dancing style to such an extent that she was able not only to dodge a punch from a much larger man but also to kill the much older and powerful Waif and fight on equal terms with Brienne of Tarth, one of the best warriors in Westeros. Arya also possesses a keen analytical mind and good acting skills, being able to perfectly emulate those whose face she is wearing while putting her Faceless Men training into practice.","Spoken by Arya                     Spoken about Arya","In the novels, Arya is left-handed.

Maisie's mother discovered that Arya is left-handed while reading the books, and urged her to play Arya left-handed, for fear that if she didn't, hardcore fans of the books would be outraged and instantly reject her performance.","After Arya regains her eyesight, The Kindly Man gives Arya her first assignment - to kill the old insurance seller. Arya is uncertain whether to fulfill her mission, since her intended victim has never wronged her, her friends or her family, and she does not even know whether he did anything that he deserves death for. At last she kills him, then the Kindly Man orders her to go to Izembaro to begin her first apprenticeship. It is unknown yet what her next assignment is, and why she needs to join Izembaro's theatre - unlike in the show, she is not ordered (yet) to kill any of the actors. While she is there she notices Rafford and kills him, without being ordered to, thus avenging Lommy's death."],"name":"Arya Stark","description":"Arya is a fiercely independent child who is unconstrained by social expectations like gender roles, courtly virtues, class distinctions, and the expectations of her parents and siblings. A tomboy, she never aspired to be a \"proper lady\" as her older sister Sansa did. Before the series of events that shatter her innocence and destroy her support system, Arya is full of life, and she makes others smile just by virtue of her spirited indifference to rules. \n\nOnce she begins the journey to King's Landing, however, she endures a constant stream of loss and trauma. As she watches her pet, sword instructor, friends, and family members taken from her one by one, she becomes increasingly detached towards murder and death. This is only exacerbated when she is captured by the Hound and is exposed to his fatalistic world view as they traverse the war-ravaged Riverlands, though the two develop a mutual reliance and almost grudging respect for each other. When she witnesses and learns of the betrayal and murder of her family at the Red Wedding, she becomes even more cold and driven to seek revenge on those who have wronged her and her family.\n\nWhile she is initially horrified when she accidentally stabs the stableboy in King's Landing during the betrayal of her father and his men, by the time she and the Hound have fled the massacre at the Twins, she is able to kill without remorse and has accepted Syrio's belief that the only true god is Death. Following Yoren's advice to her before he died, she has taken to listing off the names of each person she intends to kill each night before she sleeps.\n\nArya can be a rather cold-blooded, slightly sadistic person at times, especially while confronting and killing those who are on her death list. Though she was initially apathetic but satisfied over killing Meryn Trant and Polliver, she did not attempt to hide her glee over slitting Walder Frey's throat. While she certainly possesses compassion and kindness, her time with The Hound and the Faceless Men have taught her to be ruthless to those who have wronged her and her family and has shown to be willing to use psychological mind games to worsen her enemies fate before killing them. Shown when she repeated every word Polliver said to Lommy before killing him in the same exact way with Needle; gouged the eyes of Ser Meryn before stabbing him repeatedly and butchering Lord Walder's sons before serving their corpses to their father inside of a pie.\n\nThat being said, Arya is not completely blinded by hate. After learning that her family had retaken Winterfell, she ultimately chose reuniting with her loved ones over vengeance against her enemies (at least for the time being).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arya_Stark"}}

The Grand Maester is the personal maester to the Iron Throne and the Red Keep, and is considered the most senior member of the Order of Maesters. He is a learned man wise in history, science and medicine who also provides counsel. The Grand Maester sits on the King's Small Council, which oversees the day-to-day operations of the realm in the name of the King."],"name":"Grand Maester","description":"null\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Grand Maester is selected by the Conclave. While a Grand Maester can conceivably be removed from the Small Council, either by the King or his Hand, he cannot be stripped of his title as Grand Maester. The order of maesters and position of Grand Maester predate the creation of the Small Council by thousands of years, as the council was only formed after the Targaryen Conquest three centuries ago.\n\nKings may still try to influence who gets elected as Grand Maester, similar to how strong kings are sometimes able to influence who gets elected as the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven, but even so this is difficult to achieve. Thus while Tyrion Lannister dismissed Pycelle from the Small Council, it wasn't within his power to strip Pycelle of his rank as Grand Maester. At first, after Tyrion's father Tywin Lannister relieved him of his position as acting Hand, he hadn't intended to reinstate Pycelle. Word later reached Tywin, however, that (perhaps in protest) the candidate the Conclave intended to elect as the new Grand Maester was Mace Tyrell's uncle Gormon (youngest brother of his father Luthor). Fearing that this would give House Tyrell more political influence, Tywin simply reinstated Pycelle, as even Lord Tywin did not have the power to influence the election of his preferred candidate.\n\nThe chain of office worn by a Grand Maester is a ceremonial symbol of their office, containing numerous links from many fields of study. Because the chain is ceremonial, it does not actually represent the specific areas of knowledge that the current Grand Maester has studied. For example, the Grand Maester's chain contains an iron link representing study of warcraft, even though the current Grand Maester might not have studied warcraft (because he is a peaceful man who rose to prominence as an archmaester of medicine, economics, etc.). In practice, however, the candidate that the Conclave chooses to be the new Grand Maester is usually one of the most senior and leading members of the entire Order of Maesters, and is usually someone who happens to have attained most if not all of the links represented in the ceremonial chain of the Grand Maester.\n\nThe position of Grand Maester is usually held by the preeminent member of the entire order of maesters, often a senior member with many decades' worth of accomplishments to his name. As a result, they are often older men and thus don't tend to spend a very long time in office before they reach the end of their lives. It is therefore unusual that Pycelle was selected as Grand Maester at only 42 years old, and has thus had the uncommonly long tenure in office of over forty years (though in the centuries-long history of the maesters, such things are not entirely unheard of). The reason Pycelle was selected at such a young age is because the last three Grand Maesters before him were old men who died in rapid succession: the first two each died under a year after taking the office, and the third died of a chill before he even reached King's Landing. In frustration, it was decided to select a young and healthy man as the new Grand Maester.\n\nIn \"Fire and Blood\", Pycelle says that \"In the past 67 years, I have known, truly known, more kings than any man alive\" (i.e. Aemon might be older than him, but Pycelle has worked on a daily basis with all kings during this time). Going by the chronology in the books, 67 years ago was during the reign of Maekar I. However, the books also state that Pycelle became Grand Maester during the reign of Maekar I's successor, Aegon V. Either this is a dialogue error (unlikely, as Pycelle says \"sixty-seven\" quite clearly), or Pycelle may have been loosely referring to his entire time of service as a maester, including the years before he was made Grand Maester. The books do state that Pycelle became a maester during the reign of Maekar I. Even if this is the case, it isn't clear how Pycelle would have known Maekar I before he was Grand Maester; the simplest explanation might just be that Pycelle was speaking loosely.\n\nIt is more difficult to parse out when some of the other Grand Maesters lived. In the novels, the last entries in Malleon's book of noble lineages is from ninety years ago (in the TV continuity it extends to the present day, but other maesters may have simply updated it over time). This places Grand Maester Malleon's tenure around ~210 AL. Meanwhile, the last of the four kings that Kaeth wrote about in his book was Daeron II, who died in 209 AL. Both Malleon and Kaeth must therefore have been Grand Maester within a decade or so of each other, with Kaeth apparently following Malleon (based on the assumption that Kaeth wrote about Daeron II after he died, not in the middle of his reign).\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Grand_Maester"}}

Cersei and Robert married to seal a political alliance between House Baratheon and House Lannister after Robert took the throne by force from the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen. Myrcella had an older brother, Joffrey, and a younger, Tommen, with whom she was close. The real father of all three children is Jaime Lannister, her uncle (Cersei's twin brother) and a member of the Kingsguard, making them bastards born of incest. However, like her siblings and the rest of Westeros, Myrcella had no idea of the truth of her parentage at the time. She had a sweet and quiet disposition and was fond of her uncle Tyrion Lannister.","Myrcella accompanies her family north to Winterfell after the death of Jon Arryn.

Oberyn introduces his paramour, Ellaria Sand, to Myrcella's mother Cersei. The four of them exchange smiling pleasantries which barely hide their underlying and mutual loathing for each other. At the end of their encounter, Oberyn casually points out that Myrcella is still in Dorne; while Oberyn hints that a ward can easily become nothing more than a hostage, he also taunts Cersei and Tywin by stating that murdering little girls is frowned upon in Dorne. Tommen is crowned king after Joffrey is poisoned at his own wedding, making Myrcella the heir to the Iron Throne, as Stannis is in open rebellion and thus held as an unlawful claimant.","Myrcella visits Jaime in custody.

Meanwhile, the TV series apparently retconned how old TV-Tommen is when the role was recast in Season 4, so that he is apparently around 18 years old in Season 5 (he has to be above the legal age of adulthood in Westeros because it is explicitly stated that he no longer has a regent). With Tommen's age pushed up to around 18 in Season 5, and Joffrey's more firmly established birth date meaning he would have been 20 in Season 5 (had he lived), the only possible scenario is for Myrcella to have been 19 years old in Season 5."],"name":"Myrcella Baratheon","description":"Described as \"sweet and innocent\" by Tyrion Lannister, Myrcella is effectively the complete opposite of Cersei and Joffrey. While Joffrey is a villainous psychopath, Myrcella, as well as Tommen, is a kind and caring individual. While at Winterfell, despite not known Bran Stark all that well, she expresses concern for his well-being and is visibly happy to hear that he will live (a possibility is that she had a crush on Bran which went no further after the Lannisters returned to King's Landing).\n\nAfter the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings, Myrcella continues to be kind to Sansa Stark, despite her older brother Robb being the Lannisters' primary enemy at the time. Having grown a little older, Myrcella appears to be looking forward to Sansa and Joffrey's wedding, partly due to the dress she will be wearing, though she makes a point to mention the nicer dress Sansa will wear as the bride. Her relationship with Joffrey is not elaborated on much, but Myrcella is shown to love her family to the point that she cries while leaving for Dorne, despite the intention to keep her safe from Stannis Baratheon.\n\nDuring her years in Dorne, Myrcella matures greatly and learns to become somewhat independent of her family, after falling in love with Trystane Martell and looking up to Doran Martell as a surrogate father. When Jaime Lannister arrives in Dorne to rescue her from Ellaria Sand, Myrcella appears more surprised than happy to see her \"uncle\", and refuses more than once to return to King's Landing with him. It is only when Trystane is ordered to accompany her that she agrees, given her love for her betrothed. Her relationship with Robert Baratheon, her legal father, seems to have been somewhat distant, as with Joffrey and Tommen, since when Myrcella tells Jaime that she knows he is her real father, despite the taboo against incest, she expresses happiness, implying that she held a lot more respect for Jaime than she did for Robert.\n\nHowever, one of her greatest flaws is her naivete. After Oberyn Martell is killed, more than one threat is made towards Myrcella, the first being the theft of her necklace, which she simply assumes was stolen from her room instead of suspecting Ellaria. Even after the Sand Snakes attempt to kidnap her from the Water Gardens and Ellaria shows obvious anger when Doran arranges for her to return to King's Landing, Myrcella's innocence gets the better of her one last time and she foolishly allows Ellaria to kiss her on the lips and poison her, very easily falling for Ellaria's apology despite her so openly having threatened her life numerous times.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Myrcella_Baratheon"}}

Stephanie Blacker was not available for the fourth season due to pregnancy. Since Martin wrote \"The Lion and the Rose\", this seems to suggest that the role played by Tansy in the episode was originally intended for Violet, further evidenced by dialogue in the fifth season where Myranda mentions that Ramsay murdered Violet when she became pregnant (possibly with his child).","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no mention of a girl at the Dreadfort named Tansy. The name is apparently fairly common for girls born in the Riverlands, and is possibly meant to be a reference to an ingredient of Moon Tea, a powerful contraceptive\/abortifacient, since smallfolk often name their daughters after flowers and herbs. There are two book characters by that name, neither has anything to do with the Boltons:"],"name":"Tansy","description":"Due to Myranda's supposed jealousy of her, Tansy is hunted through the woods near the Dreadfort by Ramsay Snow, Myranda and the bastard's girls, with Reek feebly attempting to keep up. Ramsay and Myranda taunt her with mild amusement as she desperately runs to evade them, with Ramsay saying that if she makes it out of the woods, she \"wins\" -- presumably, Ramsay would stop chasing her and she'd be allowed to live. Myranda eventually strikes her in the leg with an arrow, and Tansy begs for her life as Ramsay says she has become a problem; Myranda is jealous of her presence, although Myranda denies it. Ramsay goads the dogs into ripping her to shreds as she screams. Myranda mockingly comments that she is \"not so pretty now,\" while Theon watches with discomfort.\n\nMyranda mentions Tansy to Sansa Stark as one of several women who Ramsay was involved with but killed after they began to bore him, and gleefully quips that Ramsay let her join him in \"hunting\" Tansy for fun, which angers Sansa. Tansy is later partly avenged when Myranda is thrown to her death by Theon.\n\nThough Ramsay vows to avenge her death, he orders Myranda's body to be unceremoniously fed to the dogs as Tansy was. As they flee from Winterfell on foot, Theon forces Sansa to accompany him through the freezing river to throw the hounds off scent, remembering what happened to Tansy. Eventually, Tansy is completely avenged when Ramsay is also fed to his hounds but, unlike Myranda, he is fed to them alive as Tansy was.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tansy"}}

He also lost his left eye.\n\nHe apparently was involved in a job with Asher Forrester, and afterwards the two didn't part on the best of terms.\n\nAfter the Second Sons were pledged to Daenerys Targaryen, Croft went with them to Meereen following the Battle of Yunkai. Croft leads the Hellhounds in the Second Sons.\n\nNeeding to hire an army of sellswords in order to fight back against House Whitehill, Asher suggests Croft, reasoning that Croft owes him a favor. Beskha responds that Croft probably hates Asher after their last job, but Asher promises to bring Croft to their side.\n\nAsher, Beskha, and Malcolm Branfield reach Daenerys' camp. Malcolm or Beskha, depending on who you saved earlier in the episode, set off to find Croft. Malcolm asks how well Asher knows Croft, to which both Asher and Beskha respond 'too well'. Malcolm states he thought they were friends. Asher answers this, saying they are, in fact, 'Great friends.'\n\nCroft finally appears in his tent, punching Asher's face and knocking to the ground. He curses and insults Asher, noting that Asher had some balls walking into his tent with his grin after all those years. He rants on how Asher never understood consequences, and how Asher stole from his, expecting to be forgiven. He gestures and his men grab the trio. The men push Asher against a wooden tent support, and give Croft a knife. Croft then asks how Asher is going to pay him back, and names Asher's eye, hand, and tongue. Beskha tries to diffuse the situation, citing on how she deserves his anger as much as Asher, but Croft quiets her, and states that she's next.\n\nCroft turns his attention back to Asher, ordering him to choose, or he'll cut off Asher's balls. Whatever, Asher chooses, Croft names Asher's choice, before stabbing the wooden pole behind him and laughing hysterically. His men let go of their hold on the trio. Asher and Beskha join in, with Beskha noting that is why people steal Croft's stuff and take off in the night. He orders Jodan, to fetch the Khaleesi's best wine. Malcolm comments that Croft has an interesting sense of humor. Croft then asks why Asher and Beskha are in Meereen, a long way from Yunkai. They reveal that they need Croft's Hellhounds, a hundred good men to fight in Westeros. He refuses, stating that he has good in Essos, and citing that the Second Sons are sworn to Daenerys Targaryen, and how he's laid his sword at her feet.\n\nMalcolm asks that they could speak to Daenerys, but Croft responds that she's commanding a siege, her enemies are nailing up slave children, and her dragon went missing. Asher chuckles, asserting that he knows how to find the dragon. Croft shrugs this off, and is only convinced to grant Asher a meeting with Daenerys when he either shows him a dragon tooth or Malcolm's or Beskha's burns. He remarks that if Asher is lying, it'll cost him a lot more than whatever Asher chose earlier in the episode.\n\nLater, Croft emerges from Daenerys's tent, and allows Asher to enter.\n\nCroft enters Daenerys's tent while Asher speaks with her. Asher is denied Croft's contingent of Second Sons by Daenerys. Daenerys orders Croft to see Asher's group leave, and his men move to do so. When Asher's services are offered to help the Seconds Sons in their raid on Meereen, Croft, surprised at Daenerys's interest in this, asks if she is really considering it.\n\nAfter agreeing to the terms, Daenerys states that Asher and Beskha will join Croft's men, and that he will see settled in. Croft guides them to his tent. He reminds them that they can get their armor patched up and get extra bedrolls there, as well as the piss bucket being in corner where it's always been. Beskha enters the tent, while Asher comments on how long it's been since they had a piss bucket. Croft puts his arm around Asher tent, stating that it took him two years to get where he is, and Asher better not fuck it up for him. He leaves, calling to Nail, informing him they have two more for the mission.\n\nAsher walks through the camp, to find Croft and Beskha arguing. Croft orders Beskha to stop drinking, before they go on their mission. Croft tries reason with her to listen by stating that the kind of fool who does that wants to die out there. He and Beskha get in each other's faces and the argument escalates, as Asher observes. Beskha is angered that Croft thinks she's too drunk to fight, and as he questions what she should do, she punches his stomach. Asher can encourage Croft, Beskha, try to break it up, or stay silent. Croft turns to Asher to let him deal with her, believing she will get them killed. As he begins to exit, Beskha states that Croft sounds scared, before he turns back and warns if Beskha can't hold it together, they'll leave both of them. He storms out of the tent. Later in their altercation, Beskha mentions that she doesn't care what Croft has to say.\n\nLater, in Daenerys's tent, he joins the other Second Sons in planning the meeting. As Asher enters, he moves the chips representing the Unsullied and Second Sons on various parts of Meereen. Once the Queen asks if they shall begin, Croft takes command, explains the importance of their target, four guard posts used to warn the masters if the slaves wish to revolt, which they plan to take out so they don't see the uprising coming. He assigns Therrond to the north, Penn to the south, Asher, Beskha, and himself to the east, and Kieran the west. As Beskha enters to speak to Asher, Croft warns the others to not get cocky because one mistake can cost them, and to get do what they have to do, and take their people out unharmed. Before Asher and Beskha can leave, Daenerys reminds them to follow Croft's orders exactly or they will get nothing.\n\nCroft, Beskha, and Asher sneak into Meereen. During the mission he refers to Beskha on a route to avoid the main street. However, when he gets there, Beskha notices that he thinks something is wrong, and he questions on how to get past all the guards. Once they get past them, he loads a crossbow as he as asks if they can see anyone. After Beskha moves to the slave, and holds him after he dies, he then states they must go. When Beskha asks Asher if he trusts her, he reminds him that they don't have time for it.\n\nShe walks away, and Croft orders them to follow her and they do. While Beskha beats on Dezhor zo Raza, Croft orders her to stop. Even after she reveals that he was her master, Croft continues to order to stop. When Dezhor realizes its Beskha, he calls her 'my Beskha' to which she raises her sword at him. Croft responds by raising his crossbow and orders her to let him go. He remarks that they will do what he says, and for Asher to take Beskha's sword. As Beskha tries to convince Asher, Croft reminds her that he will pay for it once the city is free. Croft against asks Asher to stop her, reminding them that he will not let them screw everything he worked for.\n\nAt this point, Asher can choose to either stop Beskha, stop Croft, or kill Dezhor himself. If he stops Beskha, she storms off and Croft, relieved, expresses that they might just make it, but his brief relief fades once Asher reminds him that she's just starting. If Asher stops Croft, he forces Croft's crossbow down and lets Beskha violently impale Dezhor with both her swords, leaving an 'x' on his chest, and he falls dead. Croft merely utters 'What have you done?' and stands there briefly, staring at Dezhor's corpse, shocked at the brutality. If Asher kills Dezhor himself, he slits his throat, to the surprise of both Croft and Beskha. While Beskha is shocked that Asher would do that, Croft warns that the Mother of Dragons will have his head for that.\n\nThe group finally reaches the guard post. They scope out the East Watcher, and Croft explains that none of the guards can reach the beacon, otherwise the invasion will become a lot harder. He hands a telescope to Asher, asking for him not to drop it. While down at the gate, Croft asks Asher to keep a eye on her. Once the guards are dead, he informs them that one group must go on the wall and reach the other side while the other shoots the men on the wall. The player chooses which way they want to go, or let Croft decide.\n\nEither way, they infiltrate into it killing many guards, and regroup outside the door of the hut. Croft sustains a knee injury, but shrugs it off. As Asher and Beskha move to get the other guards, Croft moves a barrel in front of the hut door, blocking escape for the guards. They return to Croft, who maintains guard at the hut door, in case they break through. Asher and Beskha pursue the other guards, where they can choose to follow Croft's plan to take out the guards on the wall or the ones in front of the harpy. Croft engages the guards that exit the hut as Asher and Beskha fight the other guards attempting to light the beacon. After killing the guards attempting to light the beacon, Asher and Beskha share a laugh before remembering Croft and shouting his name. They run towards the hut to find several dead bodies and Croft walking towards them. As the three hear the sounds of the uprising, Croft smiles, stating its starting.\n\nAsher, Malcolm, and Beskha enter Daenerys's tent where they briefly converse. Croft slips in and listens in on the conversation. Daenerys mentions the reports Croft gave her, and if Asher followed or didn't follow his orders. Daenerys also tells that Croft's Second Sons cannot be spared.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Croft"}}

He also blindly follows orders from Cersei. Meryn is a superb example of what a knight of the Kingsguard should not embody: Meryn Trant is a man who wields his white cloak as a privilege to do whatever he wants, and would rather victimise the weak than help it, and would rather not take important matters into his own hands. A true knight of the Kingsguard would not raise a hand to the weak, would consider the white cloak as a personification of his duty and takes matters into his own hands, considering that he should be the most skilled man available in that situation. Trant is also a sycophant, blatantly praising Joffrey as a loved person and showing pompous 'loyalty' to Joffrey when Tyrion mocks the boy. He also doesn't give Jaime Lannister much respect despite Jaime being Lord Commander.\n\nIt is also heavily implied that he is a cowardly, weak, and inept fighter due to not daring to speak again when Tyrion (figuratively) threatens to have him killed by Bronn, also having no qualms about combating Syrio Forel whilst in full armor whilst the latter is using a practice sword, or abandoning Sansa to the angry mob during the Riot of King's Landing, using his loyalty to King Joffrey as a convenient excuse (which Sandor Clegane notes by quipping that any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants). Ser Meryn's combat incompetence is explained by The Hound, as he doubts that he killed the first sword of Braavos. His insecurity explains why he shows proclivity towards abusing women (notably those who can't retaliate, like Sansa), especially children (as confirmed by Tyrion when he described him as a \"pompous child-beater\"). It is later observed that in private he is a hebephile who beats little girls, and Sandor Clegane's assessment of his combat prowess is proven correct when Arya Stark successfully kills him with ease.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Meryn_Trant"}}

However, she is intercepted before leaving the capital and gives vengeful (but false) testimony against Tyrion, whom she considers has betrayed her to remain with Sansa, at his trial for the assassination of King Joffrey, in the process having an affair with Tyrion's father, Tywin. She attempts to kill him, forcing him to kill her in self-defense, breaking him completely. ","Shae is a young woman of mystery, as she won't divulge her true origins. She has a Lorathi accent and is obviously not native to Westeros: she says she arrived there ten years ago. She is first encountered as a camp-follower with the Lannister army in the Riverlands. She has dreams of wealth and power, despite her low social status as a kept woman. She hails from the Free City of Lorath.","Shae is a camp-follower whom Bronn, a sellsword in the service of Tyrion Lannister, finds as per Tyrion's request. She is attached to a ginger-haired Knight, but Bronn \"persuades\" him to give her up to Tyrion Lannister, who is fighting with the army of Lannister in the Riverlands. He is charmed by her immediately. He tells her he wants the truth, but also that he wants her to act as if she wants him and that it's their last night on earth together. Tyrion plays a drinking game with her and Bronn in an attempt to learn more about Shae's past, but she refuses to reveal specifics. Tyrion tells her that he thinks her mother was a whore and her father deserted them, she says emphatically that he is wrong, and she doesn't want to speak of them. He seems more on the mark when he talks of her ambitions until he gets to the part of saying she was low born, she indicates he is wrong, thus she was not low-born. Shae deflects Tyrion's questions and learns about his past instead, particularly the incident involving his marriage to Tysha. When Tyrion was 16, he fell in love and secretly married a young wheelwright's daughter whom he helped protect from two rapers, but the girl turned out to be a prostitute hired by Jaime Lannister to make a man of him. When Tywin Lannister found out he had the marriage annulled and had the girl gang-raped by his guards. Shae's response is that he should have known she was a whore, as a girl doesn't invite another man into her bed after almost being raped.","Tyrion is betrayed and grievously wounded during the fighting. His defensive tactics buy enough time for reinforcements to arrive and win the battle. Varys brings Shae to see Tyrion, who has been ousted as Hand of the King and stripped of his allies while he has been incapacitated. She unflinchingly assesses his horrific facial scar and chastises him for self-pity. She begs him to go with her to Pentos but he refuses, saying that he is good at, and enjoys, playing politics. She reaffirms her love for him and comforts him.","While Shae dresses Sansa in her chambers, she heeds Ros' advice and warns Sansa about Littlefinger, pointing out that Baelish has offered to help Sansa for nothing in return because he's after something. Sansa naively says that he's an old friend of her mother's, believing that should be reason enough, but Shae suggests that Baelish is actually sexually attracted to Sansa. This disturbs Sansa, but she thinks it is simply impossible, as Baelish is so much older than her. Shae continues to warn Sansa that Baelish is manipulative and men usually only want \"one thing\" from pretty young ladies, and \"love\" often isn't what they're after. Later, Shae sneaks into Tyrion Lannister's new chambers and, despite his warnings that his father threatened to kill her if he found her with him again, she starts undressing Tyrion and asks him to protect Sansa from Baelish. Tyrion says that he doesn't have enough power or influence any more to attempt to do that, though Shae accuses him of being attracted to Sansa, which he cheerfully denies. It also comes out that Tyrion had sex with Ros back in the North, though Tyrion points out it was before he met Shae. They playfully bicker about it as they start having sex.","During the trial against Tyrion for the murder of King Joffrey, Shae appears as the final witness of the crown, clearly having been found by Cersei's agents. She falsely accuses Tyrion of having kidnapped her and forced her to become his whore and then that she witnessed Tyrion and Sansa plan the murder together, accusing Sansa of desiring revenge and forcing Tyrion into co-operating by denying him entrance into her bed. Oberyn Martell, one of the trial judges, openly questions Shae's story, clearly unconvinced. Broken, Tyrion pleads with Shae to stop, only for her to remind him that she is a whore. Her testimony is the final straw for Tyrion, who snaps and hisses at the crowd that watching Joffrey die was more pleasurable than \"a thousand lying whores\". He repudiates his father's deal for him to join the Night's Watch in return for a mercy plea, and instead demands a trial by combat.","Kekilli confirmed in multiple interviews that she was glad that Shae's story diverged so much from her book counterpart, as it kept things fresh and kept people guessing. Although Kekilli didn't have a major problem with Shae betraying Tyrion in the end, she was very displeased that the script called for Shae to implicate Sansa in the Purple Wedding.","In the books, Tyrion arranges with Varys to set up Shae at a mansion hidden in the city. Tyrion continues to meet Shae by visiting a high-end brothel, under the pretense of visiting a prostitute named Alayaya (the madam's daughter) who is learning how to read. Tyrion takes her to a room and she reads while he ducks out of the brothel, using a tunnel - which had been made for a previous Hand of the King whose sense of honor prevented him from entering the brothel openly - to a stable and then a horse to get to Shae's mansion. Because Tyrion is insecure about his appearance and Shae's attraction to other men, Varys also helps get guards that are ugly or have no interest in women for Shae's manse (these include a eunuch strangler and two hairy gay Ibbenese axemen).","The TV series changed Shae's back story (which wasn't gone into in in great detail in the books anyway) as being from the Free Cities, because they enjoyed the audition of actress Sibel Kekilli, but wanted to have some explanation for why she speaks with a German accent. In Season 1 it was only said that she was \"from the Free Cities\", but in Season 2 it was directly stated that she is from Lorath - one of the Free Cities that appears least in the novels because it is the smallest and least important, on a cold island in the Shivering Sea east of Braavos."],"name":"Shae","description":"Shae began as a curt, willingly mysterious woman with a cynical attitude and a sharp, often biting tongue. Being a prostitute for most of her life, forced to sell her body for men whom treat her like a mindless sex object to survive has left her somewhat jaded as she refuses to say anything about herself or past life and wishes to not care about the concerns or wellbeing of others. It was Tyrion who observed that Shae wanted a different life than the one she had then. Beneath this she is a much more loving, loyal and strong-willed woman who will protect those who treat her well. As stated by others she knows how to defend herself and gets by using her skills in self-defence as well as her voluptuousness and sex appeal.\n\nUp until her betrayal, Shae genuinely cared about other people. Despite her relationship with Tyrion beginning as a customer\/employer one they grew to love one another, that being said during their run they did endure tribulations which tested both of their wills. Her decisions to stay with Tyrion even when his face was wounded after the Battle of Blackwater and refusing Varys' offer to leave King's Landing in return for diamonds proves she was not the shallow whore she painted herself out to be. Tyrion's love for Shae was so great that even after she incriminates him at his trial for killing King Joffrey he admits to Tywin that he still loved her. She also grows attached to Sansa Stark as she disguises herself as her handmaiden. She goes as far to threaten a handmaiden with a knife if she told the Queen about her flowering and Sansa felt comfortable confiding her disgust over Joffrey with Shae.\n\nShae, however, is not without her own insecurities. Although throughout his marriage with Sansa, Tyrion assures that he has no romantic feelings for her whatsoever and even refuses to consummate their wedding she allows her jealousy to get the better of her, feeling envious over Sansa's highborn status and great beauty as Shae a common handmaiden and even worse, whore can not hope to have a relationship with a Lord. Moreover when Tyrion could not leave King's Landing with her as he has to fulfil his duty as a Lannister she believes he enjoys his marriage with her and will forget her eventually. Tyrion preys on these insecurities later on by degrading her as a whore and treating their relationship as if it was another encounter and she leaves King's Landing in tears.\n\nWhen she did return to the city, her jealousy was replaced by bitterness and anger. With her suspicions over Tyrion and Sansa seemingly confirmed she incriminates the two of them further by saying they planned King Joffrey's assassination together and manipulating his words of love to antagonise and humiliate him during his trial. She goes further by having an affair with his father, Tywin who has an equal amount of hatred for his son and outwardly attacks Tyrion when he finds her in his father's bedchambers either out of fear that he was there to kill her or initial anger. She ends up being strangled with the chains that symbolised their love.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Shae"}}

Margaery became Queen Consort through her marriage to King Joffrey Baratheon, and later his younger brother, King Tommen Baratheon, following Joffrey's death. Her desire to become Queen, however, ultimately proved to be her downfall as she was eventually killed along with her brother and father when the Great Sept of Baelor was destroyed with wildfire as orchestrated by Cersei Lannister to reclaim her lost power.","Margaery is the only daughter of Lady Alerie Tyrell and Lord Mace Tyrell, the Lord Paramount of the Reach. The Reach is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Tyrell is one of the Great Houses of the realm. Margaery was raised in privilege in the family seat and regional capital of Highgarden. She is close to her brother, Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers. She is also close to her handmaidens, Sera Durwell and Mira Forrester, who followed her to King's Landing from Highgarden. She is said to be as beautiful as she is clever.","King Joffrey Baratheon's Master of Coin Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish also visits the camp to treat with Renly. He makes a point of provoking Margaery about her husband's sexuality and she affirms her loyalty to Renly. Renly treats with his brother King Stannis Baratheon but is unable to reach a compromise. Renly is killed in mysterious circumstances and his Kingsguard Brienne of Tarth is blamed for his death. Margaery convinces Loras to flee the camp with her before Stannis arrives. Littlefinger accompanies them to Highgarden having gauged Margaery's ambition to become Queen.","Later, Joffrey gave Margaery a tour of the Great Sept of Baelor, where their royal wedding was scheduled to be held. They were followed by Cersei Lannister and Olenna Tyrell, representing the Lannisters and Tyrells respectively. During their tour, Joffrey talked about the various Targaryen kings who were buried within the Great Sept. Margaery feigned interest in Joffrey's topic but his mother Cersei was annoyed.","After they are left alone, Margaery sardonically suggests letting Joffrey pick out the necklace, which knowing him will likely consist of severed sparrow's heads. Olenna cautions Margaery to mind what she says, even with her. They are shortly interrupted by Brienne of Tarth, who has come to speak with Margaery about Renly's death. In private, Brienne explains what she saw and how the shadow had Stannis's face, and assures Margaery that she will find a way to avenge their king. Margaery reminds Brienne that Joffrey is their king, now. Brienne apologizes for any offense given, but Margaery assures her that none was taken. Margaery's wedding to Joffrey goes off without a hitch. At the wedding feast, however, Joffrey's cruelty and twisted sense of humor become apparent in the tasteless performance of the War of the Five Kings he has performed and in his treatment of his uncle Tyrion. Margaery is only barely able to distract him, proving her control over him is fleeting. Everything is cut short, however, when Joffrey is poisoned and dies in front of Margaery's eyes.","However, Olyvar is called in to give testimony, though it is clear he has been instructed by Cersei. He confirms the accusations against Loras, who is to be put on trial. Margaery, to her horror, is also arrested by the High Sparrow for giving false testimony, and dragged from the room while calling Tommen for help.","Just before her own walk of atonement on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor, her father, along with his army, and Jaime Lannister arrive in order to prevent her humiliation. Jaime threatens to incapacitate the Faith Militant by force, but before any hostility can occur, the High Sparrow announces King Tommen as a newly converted follower of the Faith and calls off Margaery's atonement, claiming that she has done her part by bringing Tommen onto their side.","During the meeting at Dragonstone to discuss marching full force on King\u2019s Landing, Daenerys states that she does not want to be known as Queen of the Ashes. Olenna remarks to Daenerys that Margaery was the most admired Queen in the history of the Seven Kingdoms, among the nobility and the small folk, but now all that remains of her is ashes. Olenna concludes that for Daenerys to claim the Iron Throne, she must be feared as well as loved, a trait Margaery lacked.","An interesting result of showing Margaery's POV actions is the effect it will have on portraying the sparring between Margaery and Cersei Lannister. Most of the clashes between Margaery and Cersei are shown from Cersei's POV, but Cersei is an \"unreliable narrator\". Cersei is vindictive and paranoid, and starts suspecting that anything that goes wrong in the capital, both large and small matters, must be Margaery plotting against her, or at least the Tyrell family in general. Intriguingly, at least some of these attempts to outmaneuver Cersei were objectively true, i.e. the Tyrells do try to marry Sansa to their eldest son (Willas in the books, Loras in the TV series) but how much of these plots were actually masterminded by Margaery, or simply Margaery following orders from her father Mace and grandmother Olenna, weren't entirely clear. The inner mechanics of House Tyrell's political schemes in the capital are not directly portrayed in the narrative of the books. Margaery could conceivably have masterminded some of these, while others may have been the actions of House Tyrell as a whole, though Cersei increasingly fixates on Margaery and blames her for everything the Tyrells are planning, because she fears that Margaery is the new young queen who has come to supplant her. Even so, as Cersei's paranoia increases, she starts blaming Margaery for plots which other parts of the books objectively establish that other people were responsible for (i.e. Littlefinger, Varys, the other scheming courtiers, etc.). Due to these events occurring in Cersei's skewed POV narration the books were never entirely clear about which of these were plots Margaery herself directly orchestrated (at least some actually were), and which of these plots Cersei irrationally blamed on Margaery even though she actually had no hand in them (at least some events were revealed to not involve Margaery at all). Thus the TV series may end up definitively establishing which events Margaery was or was not responsible for, when this was left deliberately vague in the novels."],"name":"Margaery Tyrell","description":"Margaery's beauty was equaled by her cleverness, which she had in abundance. A true protégée of her grandmother Olenna, she was a gifted manipulator who knew how to maneuver her way in court politics. Margaery's strength was in her ability to win the minds and loyalties of her subjects, which had proven to be a threat to those who rival her family, such as the Lannisters. She demonstrated her formidable skill in her charity work to win over the commoners of King's Landing, as well as her manipulation of Joffrey by making him think she was excited by his dark impulses. In return Margaery gained the acceptance of both her subjects and Joffrey, who was an unpredictable and uncontrollable madman to everyone else, including his mother. This proved to be a threat to Cersei, who only relied on the fear of her family name and her position as a source of power.\n\nMargaery possessed the tact and politeness that Cersei lacks. While Cersei is blunt and often rude, Margaery was capable of exuding the courtly behavior and courtesies expected of a queen - while still privately engaging in palace intrigues to increase her family's power. Cersei scorns her status as a woman in a realm dominated by men, though she is willing to use sex as a weapon to seduce those she needs (such as her cousin Lancel). In contrast, Margaery worked within the social standards of \"proper\" femininity in Westeros, but adeptly turned them to her favor, to orchestrate political machinations from behind the scenes.\n\n\u200BAlthough Margaery had to develop many different facades depending on who she is trying to manipulate, she was shown to genuinely have a good heart, compassion, and empathy. Margaery had loving relationships with all of her family members. She loved her brother Loras and was entirely tolerant of his homosexuality - to the point that when her father contracted a marriage-alliance between herself and Loras's own lover Renly, she acknowledged that it was a paper marriage, and was quite frank that she had no issues with her new husband continuing his sexual relationship with her brother. She also showed genuine concern and tried to form a friendship with Sansa, even offering her help to get out of King's Landing once married to Joffrey - though this may have been in part because she had the more long-term goal of good relations with the North, sensing that the unstable Lannisters wouldn't be in power forever. She shared a very strong bond with her grandmother, sharing her acuity for manipulation and political maneuvering. Though she had developed many facades in order to sway the opinions of others in her favor, she was extremely loyal to her family and house, and would go to great lengths to keep them safe. Though she was willing and able to feign affection for Renly and Joffrey, she genuinely cared for Tommen (she may not have loved him, but it's quite clear that she at least liked him) and bore him no ill will when he failed to stop the arrest of both her and her brother, a feeling which he reciprocated to such an extent that he willingly committed suicide when she was murdered by Cersei.\n\nIt should be noted that Margaery herself was not technically outmanoeuvred by Cersei in the end: Margaery, even without having any idea of the wildfire plot, realised the threat of Cersei's absence, and thus ordered an evacuation, potentially with time to spare to get everyone out. It was, instead, it was the High Sparrow who was outmanoeuvred, refusing to listen to Margaery and not accepting that his plans were about to collapse.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Margaery_Tyrell"}}

He was extremely courageous, leading the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood and outmatching the Smiling Knight in sword combat - the Smiling Knight had previously defeated a young Jaime Lannister and was considered a terrifying opponent, making Arthur's defeat of him impressive. He is remembered as an excellent swordsman, and when he finally appears when Bran Stark wargs to the confrontation at the Tower of Joy, he is shown to be an incredibly skilled warrior, wielding two swords expertly and cleaving through nearly every opponent he faced - the Three-Eyed Raven pointed out that Arthur was vastly superior to Eddard Stark, and the only reason that he lost was because he was blindsided by Howland Reed.\n\nSer Arthur's reputation was such that, when people remembered him, it was in acclaim. Years later, Eddard Stark would comment that Ser Arthur Dayne was the best warrior Ned had ever encountered. Even when they outnumbered him, Ned and his companions were extremely wary about how to approach him, showing that Arthur's skill and reputation frightened them. In addition, Arthur was extremely loyal, to a fault, to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, stating very matter-of-factly that the only reason he and Ser Gerold did not fight on the Trident was because Rhaegar ordered them to remain at the tower. Even after the deaths of Rhaegar and Aerys, he continued to follow Rhaegar's orders to protect the pregnant Lyanna Stark, even if that meant killing her brother Eddard. Although this probably had to do mostly with his vows, it could have also had something to do with the fact that Rhaegar's great-grandmother, Queen Dyanna, was born a Dayne, which could have in turn made Rhaegar and his children, including Jon, kin of some sort to Ser Arthur. Not much else is known about Ser Arthur, but he is shown to be extremely gentlemanly and polite in Bran's vision, greeting his father by title and even wishing him \"good fortune in the wars to come\"; a hint that despite his skills as a swordsman, even he sometimes, if not always, considered the possibility of losing before fighting someone else to the death. This also suggests that Arthur did not fear death as evidenced by the fact that he didn't beg for his life when Howland Reed wounded him. Instead, he simply faced Ned down before the latter finished him off.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Arthur_Dayne"}}

All major religions in the Seven Kingdoms - the Faith of the Seven, followers of the Old Gods of the Forest, and followers of the Drowned God - attach very negative social stigmas to bastardy."],"name":"Bastardy","description":"Bastards are not allowed to inherit their father's lands or titles, and have no claims to the privileges of their father's House. It is up to their father, if he knows they exist, on how to raise or treat them. At worst, they are unacknowledged and ignored by their father and left completely in the hands of their mothers. Some may fare better and be discreetly sent funds to ensure their well-being. At best, a lord will acknowledge his bastard children (allowing them to take on one of the special bastard surnames), but send them away to one of his distant castles to be raised away from his lawful family. For bastard children to be raised by their father in his own castle alongside his trueborn children - such as Eddard Stark did for his bastard \"son\", Jon Snow - is considered extremely unusual.\n\nFaced with very low expectations for inheritance, many noble-born bastard sons, even acknowledged ones, voluntarily join the Night's Watch to seek prestige and equality. The Night's Watch is highly egalitarian compared to the rest of Westeros, and at the Wall every man is given what he earns. Both bastards, alongside other recruits, can become high-ranking officers and commanders for their service, although noble-born bastard sons of lords are favoured for advancement over bastard sons with no noble blood. Bastards may also take up the life of knighthood in the hope of being granted a place in a lord's household, or even gaining lands and titles for services to their liege lords. In this way, a bastard may become the founder of a noble house. Bastard children may also be given over to the Faith of the Seven as acolytes, to join monastic orders or the clergy, and bastard sons may be sent to train as Maesters. Because the order of Maesters is all-male, bastard daughters face limited prospects outside of the clergy or a good marriage.\n\nThere is no outright law punishing noble men or women for having bastard children. Instead it is considered a social and religious disgrace.\n\nIn any event, since a highborn bastard carries the blood of a noble house, rival claimants may still consider them a potential threat. For this reason, King Joffrey orders the massacre of Robert's bastards because they are his true children and thus stronger claimants to the throne than he is. When Roose Bolton and Ramsay Snow discuss their search for the remaining male Stark children, Ramsay suggests that they get rid of Jon Snow, reasoning that since he is Eddard Stark's bastard son, Jon could become a threat to their rule in the North, even though he has joined the Night's Watch and given up any possible future claim.\n\nIt is possible for the king to legitimize a lord's bastard children, but this special dispensation is difficult to acquire and does not happen frequently. It will usually be granted only if a lord has no legitimate children (or at least no male children) to carry on the name of his house. However, the social stigma is not automatically removed after the bastard is formally legitimized. Ramsay Snow is a case in point; even after he had been legitimized as Ramsay Bolton, his future was still uncertain. Since Roose Bolton's trueborn child by Walda Frey was a boy, as they had expected, he may have had a stronger claim to the Bolton lands and titles, something that Sansa Stark openly noted. Although Roose Bolton said that Ramsay always would be his firstborn, Ramsay still stabbed him to death afterward and fed his brother and Walda to the hounds, out of fear that his inheritance would fall to his trueborn brother once he reached the rightful age to claim their fathers lands and titles.\n\nDue to its unique history and culture, bastards in Dorne are not looked down upon the way they are in the rest of the Seven Kingdoms. Many present-day Dornishmen are descended from the Rhoynar people who migrated to Westeros a thousand years ago, and who possessed an urban culture based around city-states along the Rhoyne River in Essos. The culture they passed down to the present-day Dornishmen has relatively relaxed attitudes towards sexual matters. While the Rhoynar who came to Dorne did convert to the Faith of the Seven, they basically just ignored the rules they didn't like, and follow the religion much less strictly than other parts of Westeros (though they are no less devout regarding the rules they do follow). Many Dornish nobles have formalized lovers known as paramours, and they do not possess the same stigma against homosexual behavior that the rest of Westeros does.\n\nThese relaxed sexual mores in Dorne extend to bastard children. The Dornish feel that bastards are born of passion and love - unlike the rest of the Seven Kingdoms who consider them born of lies and deceit - and thus would not disdain a child for such a parentage. While it is rare and scandalous for a lord from outside of Dorne to raise his bastard child in his home castle alongside his trueborn children (as Eddard Stark did with Jon Snow), it is actually commonplace in Dorne to see bastards living at the court of their noble parents; Oberyn Martell raised his eight illegitimate daughters in Sunspear, alongside his brother's trueborn children. The Dornish are also much more likely to acknowledge bastard children in the first place. They would consider it cruel for a lord to abandon his own flesh and blood, as King Robert Baratheon ignored the many bastard children he fathered over the years. Because Dornish culture holds little if any stigma against bastards, it is not unusual to see bastards work their way up to important social or court positions there, holding castles or leading armies for their families.\n\nBastards in Dorne still face a few restrictions, but these are relatively minor compared to the rest of the Seven Kingdoms. Bastards in Dorne must still use a special bastard surname - in this case \"Sand\" - and they are less likely to inherit from their parents. While Jon Snow was roughly the same age as his father's eldest trueborn son, Robb Stark, he was still shooed outside during the great feast at Winterfell, rather than potentially offend King Robert and Queen Cersei by seating a bastard at the main table. The Dornish, in contrast, feel that an older bastard does have a place within the family and is not shameful. A bastard child is also treated somewhat like a younger child in order of inheritance. For example, if the Starks lived in Dorne, Jon Snow would be treated as a younger brother, behind even Rickon in the line of succession, but otherwise he would be treated as a full member of the family.\n\nAnother minor stigma against bastards in Dorne is that they are not considered ideal marriage prospects. Essentially, it would be considered beneath one's station for a powerful lord to marry a noble-born bastard. In many cases, this is simply due to the practical reason that a bastard is less likely to inherit, and thus the marriage would probably not bring with it any new wealth or lands. This stigma is somewhat similar to a nobleman marrying a daughter from another House who was trueborn, but who was also the youngest of five daughters, and thus a very poor match. Ellaria Sand is an acknowledged bastard of House Uller, one of the more powerful noble families in Dorne. Even in the relaxed social mores of Dorne, however, it would still have been beneath his station for Prince Oberyn Martell, younger brother of the ruler of Dorne, to wed Ellaria. While Oberyn could not marry Ellaria, he simply made her his formal paramour, his wife in all but name.\n\nAcknowledged bastards are not legally permitted to officially carry the Heraldry of their noble parent's House. They may unofficially carry a flag displaying the heraldry on the battlefield, or use weapons and equipment that display its heraldic symbol, but only as much as any common footsoldier in their noble parent's army may do so. If an acknowledged noble-born bastard began openly wearing capes and armor displaying the heraldry of his noble parent's House, and using banners displaying the heraldry at formal social functions, it would be falsely presenting themselves as a trueborn child and not a bastard. He would face legal troubles and punishment.\n\nBefore he joined the Night's Watch and forsook all family ties, Jon Snow was forbidden from officially \"carrying\" and displaying the Stark heraldry of a grey direwolf on a white field. One of House Stark's bannermen such as Ser Rodrik Cassel might physically hold a flag displaying the Stark heraldry, or even a common Stark footman might carry such a flag, and thus Jon may have carried weapons or equipment featuring the Stark direwolf design motif. Jon would not have been allowed to use the Stark heraldry as a representation of himself, because this would be essentially making the false claim that he was a legitimized child who no longer bore the shame of his bastardy.\n\nNoble-born bastards are in a legal state between fullborn nobles and smallfolk, however, and unlike the smallfolk, acknowledged bastards are allowed to use their own heraldry - just not the heraldry of their noble parent's House. A very common custom in Westeros is for bastards to use the heraldry of their noble-born parent's House but with the colors inverted (which is known as \"breaking\" the design scheme). While both the books and TV series never portrayed Jon Snow as using any kind of heraldry, if he followed this custom his personal sigil would have been a white direwolf on a grey field, the reverse of the Stark colors. Thus the discovery of the six direwolf pups by Ned Stark and his sons is all the more considered a sign from the Old Gods. Not only were there two female and four male pups (to match the Stark children), but the sixth was an albino - physically resembling the white direwolf design that Jon would use in heraldry as a bastard son. This is further signified in the season 6 finale, when Lord Wyman Manderly dubs Jon the \"white wolf\" upon his election as the new King in the North.\n\nOne of the more infamous examples of bastard heraldry is House Blackfyre, a cadet branch of House Targaryen founded over a century before the War of the Five Kings. Prince Daemon, the founder of the house, was a bastard son of King Aegon IV who was legitimized by his father, and he took the name Blackfyre after the Valryrian steel sword originally carried by his ancestor Aegon the Conquerer. Following the custom for bastards, Daemon inverted the color scheme of the Targaryen heraldry, so instead of the normal red three-headed dragon on a black background, House Blackfyre's heraldry consisted of a black three-headed dragon on a red background.\n\nThe is no marriage in Naath so the concept of bastardy is unfamiliar to its people. Missandei is confused when she asks Davos Seaworth about Jon Snow's name and parentage. \n\nThe stigma of illegitimacy is so great that all acknowledged bastards born to a noble in Westeros have to identify themselves through a specific surname marking them as a bastard, which varies by region:\n\nnull\n\nHowever, this system does not apply to the bastards of smallfolk. At least one parent (usually, but not always, the father) has to be a member of a noble House. If both the father and mother are commoners, the child cannot use the special surname.\n\nThe low-born commoners of Westeros do not actually use surnames at all. Therefore, possessing a bastard surname is simultaneously a mark of distinction and badge of shame. Anyone who encounters someone with a bastard surname will immediately know that they are not simply a bastard, but the bastard child of a noble.\n\nBastards only use the special surnames if they have been openly acknowledged by their noble-born parent. In such cases, their noble parent will usually try to make sure that they are well cared for, or send money for their support, but it is extremely unusual for a noble to raise their bastard child in their own household.\n\nThere is no official distinction between bastards who have one noble-born parent, and those whose parents are both noble-born. In practice, however, a nobleman would be much more likely to acknowledge a bastard child born to a noble lady than he would a child born to a commoner.\n\nBastard surnames are dependent on the region a child was born in, i.e. where the mother is from, not where the father is from. For example, a noble lord from the Stormlands could father one bastard child in the Vale, and another in the Riverlands, but neither would use the surname \"Storm\": the first bastard would use the surname \"Stone\", and the second would use the surname \"Rivers.\" It is extremely unusual for a bastard to know who his nobleman father is, but not his mother. Therefore Jon Snow's situation is additionally unusual, not just because he actually lives with his nobleman father, but because he wasn't even born in the North. Eddard Stark brought him back to Winterfell as an infant after fighting in the south during Robert's Rebellion, but refused to say who his mother was or where she came from. As a result of the mystery surrounding his mother's identity, Jon ended up using the surname \"Snow\" by default.\n\nBastard children of a noble may be politely referred to as \"natural children\", though the less polite term \"baseborn\" is more commonly used, and they are often (bluntly and rudely) simply referred to as \"bastard.\" In contrast, a noble lord's children with his lawfully married wife are termed \"trueborn\". Thus when Lord Eddard Stark discovers that none of Cersei Lannister's children were fathered by her husband King Robert Baratheon, he says that King Robert \"has no trueborn sons,\" even though he knows that Robert has several \"baseborn,\" bastard children.\n\nThe North\n\nThe Iron Islands\n\nThe Riverlands\n\nThe Crownlands\n\nThe Reach\n\nThe Westerlands\n\nThe Vale of Arryn\n\nDorne\n\nnull\n\nUnacknowledged bastards\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the status of being a bastard is a considerable social disgrace amongst the nobility, though less so amongst the smallfolk and in Dorne. However, while bastards are disadvantaged, they still have means to climb the social ladder. They may win honor and glory in battle and be knighted. If they do great deeds in service to the king or a noble lord, they can even receive a bill of legitimacy, allowing them to take their father's surname and formally join his House, or to take a new surname and found a new House (some bastards take new names altogether, like \"Blackfyre\", while others add a prefix to their bastard name, such as \"Longwaters\"). For example, House Baratheon was founded by the legitimized bastard half-brother of Aegon the Conqueror.\n\nHowever, while bastards stand outside the lines of succession and inheritance, there are still exceptions which have caused immense problems. King Aegon IV Targaryen legitmized three of his bastard sons and one of his bastard daughters on his deathbed. His eldest bastard son, Daemon Blackfyre, later claimed the Iron Throne and led a bloody civil war known as the First Blackfyre Rebellion. His sons and descendants launched four more attempts to take the Iron Throne before their final claimant, Maelys the Monstrous, was slain by Ser Barristan Selmy during the War of the Ninepenny Kings. This is sometimes used as an example of what happens if a bastard is treated too well and given too much power and legitimacy.\n\nThere is no official distinction between bastards who have one noble-born parent, and those whose parents are both noble-born. In practice, however, a nobleman would be much more likely to acknowledge a bastard child born to a noble lady, than he would a child born to a commoner. For example, while Robert Baratheon is rumored to have fathered over a dozen bastard children, the only one who he acknowledged in the books was Edric Storm, because his mother was a noblewoman, Delena of House Florent - the younger first cousin of Selyse Florent, the wife of Robert's younger brother Stannis.\n\nIt is unclear how the system of special bastard surnames developed in Westeros. Since at least the unification of the Seven Kingdoms during the Targaryen Conquest (three centuries before the narrative begins), the use and implementation of the bastard surnames has been quite uniform: there is one bastard surname used for each of the nine regions in the realm (the original \"Seven Kingdoms\", plus the borderlands that became the Riverlands, and the new region of the Crownlands that the Targaryens carved out around their new capital city, King's Landing). Before that, it is unclear if they were introduced by the First Men who migrated to Westeros 12,000 years ago, or by the Andals who migrated to Westeros 6,000 years ago, or if they simply originated on their own in Westeros itself at a later date.\n\nWesteros was not always divided into these \"Seven Kingdoms\" however, and after the Andal invasion the continent was still divided into dozens of petty kingdoms, which only unified into seven larger kingdoms within the past two thousand years or so. Dorne was the last of the kingdoms to be unified, only about one thousand years ago. When Highgarden and Oldtown were both at the center of rival and independent kingdoms, before they were united in the \"Kingdom of the Reach\", it isn't clear if they even used the same bastard surnames.\n\nMoreover, the Riverlands were a border zone always contested between its powerful neighbors - when the Riverlands were conquered and held by the Stormlands for three full centuries, did bastards born there use the special surname \"Rivers\" or \"Storm\"? When the ironborn conquered the Riverlands from the Stormlands and held it for three generations, did Riverlands bastards start using the surname \"Pyke\"? For that matter, House Greyjoy of Pyke only became the ruling family of the Iron Islands after the Targaryen Conquest exterminated House Hoare, whose seat was on Orkmont island - what surname did ironborn bastards use before that? While the other kingdoms gradually coalesced over centuries, the Targaryens created the Crownlands all at once, implying that at some point they had to make a formal decree creating the new surname \"Waters\" for bastards from the region. The answers to these questions are unknown.\n\nThe bastard surnames are used by nobles belonging to every religious or cultural group, from Oldtown to the North, and the Iron Islands to Dorne. Dorne itself does not considered bastardy to be shameful, and its cultural also has paramours - official mistresses\/concubines, such as Ellaria Sand. Still, Dorne also uses the bastard surnames. The ironborn also practice a limited form of polygamy - they can have only one \"rock wife\", but can take multiple \"salt wives\" - captives taken as formal concubines. The children of salt wives are not considered to be bastards, though they rank behind the children of a lord's rock wife in the line of succession.\n\nBastards need to be acknowledged by a noble-born parent in order to use the special bastard surnames. The only known exception to this rule in the books is Mya, the eldest of Robert's bastards: she is commonly known as \"Mya Stone\" although she has never been officially acknowledged by Robert. He actually did spend some time with her when he was living in the Vale and she was a toddler, and apparently this gave him a fondness for her that he didn't have for his numerous other bastard children: at some point during his reign Robert openly expressed interest in bringing her to live at court in King's Landing, probably to formally acknowledge her as well. Nothing came of this, however, because Cersei bluntly implied that she would have the girl killed if she came to the capital city. Thus it is possible that Mya Stone uses the bastard surname because Robert wanted to acknowledge her, and her status as his daughter was an open secret.\n\nFans sometimes derisively assume that \"Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen Baratheon\" should really be called by the Lannister surname because of their status as the bastard offsprings of the incestuous relationship between Cersei Lannister and Jaime Lannister, and not the sons and daughter of King Robert Baratheon at all. This is actually an error, as according to the customs of bastardy, Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen don't even have the right to use the surname \"Lannister\". As Jaime's bastard children, given birth to by a woman from the Westerlands (Cersei), the three would have to use the bastard surname for the Westerlands: \"Hill\". There's also the possibility that he might use \"Waters\" given that both Jaime and Cersei had been living in the Crownlands for many years, and the three have lived their whole lives there. All of this, of course, would only happen if Jaime were to openly acknowledge Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen as his children, which is an impossibility given the disastrous political fallout this would create. Further, as the product of not merely bastardy, but incest, the Faith of the Seven would want to outright kill them as abominations before the gods if their actual parentage was ever revealed. Given these factors, Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen are entitled to no surname; the legal status of a baseborn commoner.\n\nMarriage in the real-life Middle Ages was primarily focused on producing \"legitimate\" children - i.e. children confirmed to have been born only to the married man and woman during their marriage. Yet the status of children produced outside of marriage varied quite widely across time and place. Before the  Gregorian Reform in the eleventh century, concubines often had semi-official or even official status and rights, as did their children. It was only starting in the eleventh century that the Christian Church began to stress that only children produced in the marriage of one man to one woman were \"legitimate\", and any produced outside of that marriage were \"illegitimate\". Before that time, not nearly as much stigma was applied to bastardy.\n\nHowever, it took time for this new definition of marriage - and the notion that children born outside of it were shameful \"bastards\" - to take full effect. William the Conqueror, who became king of England in 1066, was - by some definitions - a bastard son of Robert of Normandy. The Normans, who originated in Scandinavia, had practiced polygamous marriages not that long ago in the past, and some continued to keep concubines. While these concubines were no longer considered to be fully married to the man, their children were usually considered just as legitimate as children produced within marriage. Robert recognized William as his heir, and by Norman standards of the time William was not considered \"illegitimate\". William's son King Henry I of England (1069-1135) had six publicly known concubines and at least twenty acknowledged children by them. At at that point in time, the Church had yet to fully impress upon the general populace the new value that \"bastardy\" was shameful, to the point that a king of England openly had many bastard children, and even gave them lands and titles. Gradually, however, towards the end of the 1100's, this new definition of \"bastardy\" as shameful was becoming generally accepted.\n\nIn subsequent centuries, ecclesiastical law in most of Western Europe dictated that a bastard child who had been born to two unmarried parents was automatically legitimized if the parents subsequently married. Under English Common Law, however, a bastard could only receive Legitimization by being issued letters patent requested from the king. For example, John of Gaunt asked and received a legitimization decree from King Richard II for his children by Katharine Swynford - his sons had been born out of wedlock but he later married Katharine as his third wife. His originally bastard son was the ancestor of Henry VII, founder of the Tudor dynasty. Martin has said that the A Song of Ice and Fire series is loosely inspired by the War of the Roses in England during the 1400s, between the Yorks and Lancasters (paralleled by the Starks and Lannisters in Westeros). During the War of the Roses, the Yorkist faction overthrew the last Lancastrian king Henry VI - but years later the Yorkists were ultimately defeated in a rebellion led by Henry VII, who descended from one of John of Gaunt's bastard sons (i.e., the Lannisters seize power over the Baratheons and their Stark allies when King Robert dies, but King Robert left behind a bastard son, Gendry...)\n\nIn the core regions of the Seven Kingdoms, standards about bastardy are more similar to late Medieval Europe: bastards are considered \"illegitimate\", a shameful reminder of sins of the flesh, and they cannot inherit lands and titles from their parent. Standards about bastards in Dorne are closer to how bastard children were treated in the early Middle Ages. The system of special bastard surnames used in Westeros are a fictional invention of George R.R. Martin for his fantasy world, and does not reflect real-life practices.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bastardy"}}

He is from House Thorne, a noble house of the Crownlands sworn to the Iron Throne.

He chose the latter.","Thorne is pleased when Jon is made a steward, since Jon had hoped to become a ranger like his uncle Benjen Stark. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont takes Jon as his personal steward. Jon believes that Thorne played a hand in him becoming a steward as revenge for defying him, but Sam convinces Jon that this means that Jon will be privy to the inner workings of the Night's Watch command structure, and that the Lord Commander may actually want to groom Jon for a high position within the Watch.","Jon survives the mission and returns to Castle Black unharmed, to Thorne and Slynt's disappointment. When Thorne catches sight of Jon's direwolf, Ghost, he orders Jon to lock up his 'wild beast' or Ghost will become food for the Watch.

However, Thorne rubbishes the claim and asks the First Builder, Othell Yarwyck, for his opinion. Yarwyck agrees with Thorne, though he has obviously been intimidated by Thorne's tone of voice. He also sends Jon and Sam to keep a watch in the night to look out for Mance's army.","With the choosing of a new official Lord Commander impending, Alliser seems to be the favorite to succeed Jeor Mormont due to his efforts during the Battle at Castle Black. Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth attempt to use this to sway Jon to their side, implying that Alliser will make Jon's life in the Watch miserable solely to undermine him. During the choosing, Alliser runs against Denys Mallister and Jon. While Thorne acknowledges Jon's accomplishments, he also reminds the black brothers of Jon's sympathy towards the wildlings. However, Thorne loses by a single vote - that of Maester Aemon - and Jon is chosen as the new Lord Commander.","Thorne does not hide his role in the mutiny and manages to win over the majority of the Watch by reasoning that Jon was willing to risk the Watch's future through his allegiance with the wildlings. Effectively acting Lord Commander of the Night's Watch once again, Thorne speaks with Davos Seaworth, who is guarding Jon's body in a locked room with Dolorous Edd and other Black Brothers loyal to Jon, and offers him safe passage to the South with a horse and supplies, but Davos's mocking request for mutton convinces Thorne that they have no intention of backing down, but will fight to the death. Thorne promises Davos that if he and Jon's friends do not surrender, they will die.","Jon doesn't give Ser Alliser any promotion. Instead he dispatches him, along with eight other rangers, to scout beyond the Wall. Thorne believes Jon is sending him to his death, but reluctantly agrees, stating venomously that he knows Jon would like nothing more than an excuse to kill him the same way as Slynt. Before departing, he ominously warns Jon that he will return to Castle Black, one way or another. Subsequently, he is not present in the mutiny that results in Jon's apparent death, although his role in the mutiny in the television series suggests that he will return to Castle Black in a later novel."],"name":"Alliser Thorne","description":"Though Alliser Thorne is depicted as a stern, unsympathetic and sometimes cruel man, he is not inherently malicious or evil. His behavior and animosity towards Jon Snow and the other recruits of the Night's Watch appear to be due to his noble background and his distaste at how the Watch has become nothing more than a glorified penal colony. His resentment towards Jon stems from his dislike for Ned Stark, one of the rebels who brought down the Targaryen dynasty, which led to Tywin Lannister having him exiled to the Wall. Thorne has become a hardened and bitter person as a result, and does not tolerate weakness or cowardice, demonstrated when, for entertainment, he humiliates Samwell Tarly in the courtyard, and shows anger at Jon protecting him, telling him that being soft will not help Sam and will only get him killed.\n\nDespite his flaws, however, Thorne appears to be a fundamentally decent man, and most of his actions are dedicated towards protecting the Wall and the Seven Kingdoms against any threat from the lands beyond, no matter how unethical they may seem. He holds Maester Aemon and Qhorin Halfhand in high regard, outright admitting to Jon that he saw Qhorin as a brother, and valiantly leads the Night's Watch into battle against the wildlings and duels Tormund Giantsbane alone. Prior to the battle, he shares a moment with Jon and explains the difficulties of leadership to him, and does his best to encourage Jon to not lose heart, though this is possibly because he believed they were both about to die soon. Following Maester Aemon's funeral, he warns Sam that he is losing his friends, which could be his own gruff way of warning Sam of what is coming.\n\nHis dedication to his goal and his distrust for Jon are also what lead him to spark a mutiny against Jon: in his eyes, by letting the wildlings pass through the Wall into the Seven Kingdoms to avoid the coming White Walkers, Thorne believes that Jon has committed the ultimate betrayal towards the Night's Watch, since keeping the wildlings beyond the wall was the very cause that most of their sworn brothers bled and died for, which appears to depict him as somewhat shortsighted, given his hatred for the wildlings blinds him to the true danger approaching Westeros. Thus, he does not stab Jon out of spite or jealousy, but out of anger and grief for his slain comrades, hence his words, \"For the Watch\" (although David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have hinted that Thorne's personal vendetta against Jon may have been a factor in his decision to mutiny against him).\n\nIn his final moments, Thorne contemplated that it wasn't a choice of betraying Jon or betraying his personal interest, but rather the latter meaning betraying the Night's Watch - Jon had brought the Wildlings from Beyond the Wall and broken a crucial element of the vow he took, and in Thorne's opinion that justified his execution. Despite this, Thorne admitted that he had ultimately lost the battle he was fighting, and calmly awaited his execution, believing it was finally his chance to rest - however he still pointed out to Jon that the latter would be fighting their battles forever in Alliser's place.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Alliser_Thorne"}}

Catelyn herself heard maidservants discussing the rumor that Jon's mother was Ashara Dayne of Starfall - Edric's own aunt, not just a servant. Ashara's brother was Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard, whom Ned and his allies killed in the final confrontation of the war, the Showdown at the Red Mountains. Afterwards Ned returned the Dayne ancestral sword Dawn to Starfall out of respect, at which Ashara unexpectedly committed suicide by throwing herself off a cliff into the sea. The rumor was that Ashara didn't simply kill herself because her brother died in war (which happens to many women), but out of grief that her own lover had killed him. Catelyn asked Eddard about Ashara and Jon once early in their marriage: it was the only time Eddard ever truly became angry at her and frightened Catelyn. He said nothing, but commanded her never to ask about Ashara or about the identity of Jon's mother ever again, and indeed she never did afterwards. Even so this was only one of the more prominent of several rumors about the identity of Jon's mother. Others say that she was a fisherman's daughter in the Vale, where Eddard had been staying as a ward of Jon Arryn when the war broke out, and that he fathered Jon on her as he was fleeing back to the North to raise its armies after the Mad King killed his father and brother."],"name":"Wylla","description":"Over a meal, Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark recall the names of several women they knew when they were younger. Robert recalls one woman whom he believes to be the mother of Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow, and Eddard confirms her name was \"Wylla\". The same as the first and only time they discuss it, Ned refuses to tell Robert what she looked like. Robert tells Eddard not to be too hard on himself as they were at war and could have died at any time.\n\nJon Snow says Ned Stark never told him who his mother was, or if his mother is still alive. Eddard had earlier promised Jon that he would talk to him about his mother the next time they met, although Eddard's subsequent beheading made that impossible.\n\nWatching Jon training his men in the practice yard of Castle Black, Selyse Baratheon dismisses him, opining that he is just the bastard son of some tavern slut that Eddard encountered. Her husband Stannis Baratheon, however, says he doubts that. Having known Eddard personally, he says it really wasn't the way of the honorable Ned Stark to frequent prostitutes the way that Stannis's own brother King Robert did.\n\nDuring Greensight, Bran Stark discovers that Jon is not Ned Stark's son at all - he is actually Lyanna Stark's son, fathered by Rhaegar Targaryen, her alleged kidnapper, and born in the Tower of Joy while Ned and Howland Reed fought the last two Targaryen loyalists.

He commands a fleet of thirty ships that frequently prey on merchant ships traveling between Westeros and the Free Cities to the east. Sometimes in pursuit of extra wealth, he shifts from pure piracy to being a sellsail: hiring out the services of his ships and crews to the highest bidder, to act as mercenaries in various conflicts.\n\nDoreah pleasures Viserys and tells him that she once saw a pirate covered in gold who flew colorful sails.\n\nDavos Seaworth and his son Matthos meet Saan on a beach nearby Dragonstone. Davos promises the pirate he will be paid a fortune in gold when they take King's Landing. Salladhor is dubious of Stannis Baratheon's chances as he has the smallest army of all the claimants to the Iron Throne, to which Davos answers that Stannis is a proven battle commander unlike the inexperienced Renly or Joffrey, adding that Stannis has just begun the fight and expects more of his bannerman to join his cause because he is the most honorable man in the Seven Kingdoms. Salladhor notes the irony of a smuggler vouching for the honor of a king. Matthos warns Salladhor to mind his words, calling him a pirate. Davos silences his son and Salladhor points out he is not insulted, asserting being not only a pirate but an excellent one and that he does not sail for promises. Davos challenges this, explaining that Salladhor sails on a promise of ships to plunder every time he leaves port. Salladhor says that promise always comes true and Davos says that his promise is the same. Davos points out that Salladhor is not a young man and that pirate's lives are short. Salladhor jokes that only the clever pirates grow old. Davos suggests that Salladhor could continue to steal from cargo ships and live an easy life while it lasts but that he is offering a harder alternative with greater rewards. He promises riches and fame.\n\nSalladhor says that he has a good name for songs and then tells Davos that he wants Queen Cersei. He says that he will lend his thirty ships provided he can get Cersei when they take King's Landing. Matthos is annoyed by Salladhor's selfishness and says they are not fighting for Salladhor to rape the Queen. Salladhor makes the distinction that he does not intend to rape her and jokes that Matthos has not experienced his persuasiveness. Matthos insists that Stannis has a divine right to rule and that the Lord of Light is the only god. However, Salladhor is dismissive of religion. Matthos turns away and Davos says that he cannot promise the Queen, only the gold and glory. Salladhor asks if Davos believes that Stannis can win and Davos replies that Stannis is the \"one true king.\" Salladhor contrasts Davos's loyalty to Stannis against their history together; Stannis chopped off Davos's fingers for smuggling. Salladhor says that he will sail with Davos because Davos is the most honest smuggler he has ever met and asks Davos to make him rich. They shake hands and Salladhor leaves.\n\nLater that night Davos informs Stannis that Salladhor has agreed to join his forces. Stannis asks Davos if they can trust Salladhor, and he responds that he has known Salladhor for thirty years but has never \"trusted\" him. However, Davos is certain that Salladhor has been tantalized by his promise of vast wealth.\n\nSalladhor's ship rescues Davos, who was thrown overboard by the wildfire blast in the Battle of Blackwater, from the sea. Salladhor, who abandoned Stannis' cause after the battle, offers Davos his hospitality but is very reluctant to take Davos to Dragonstone. He tries to dissuade Davos from trying to kill the red priestess Melisandre since she has sacrificed any man who speaks against her since the Battle of the Blackwater. He says she accuses those who are against her of being servants of darkness, and since they're both criminals they should stay well away. Davos insists on being taken back to Stannis's castle, and Salladhor eventually agrees to stay just long enough to see Davos ashore.\n\nHaving returned to Braavos after his failed exploits off the coasts of Westeros, Salladhor spends his time with a couple of whores in a bathhouse. He tells them a joke about a brave ship captain facing pirate ships, but is not amused when the whores reveal they know the punchline just before he delivers it. He is surprised when Ser Davos appears and tells him they will sail for Castle Black at sunrise. The pirate begins to complain, but Davos throws him a package of gold coins from the Iron Bank, noting that more money waits at his home \u2013 with his wife. Salladhor sarcastically declares that contrary to popular opinion, Davos is not his friend.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Salladhor_Saan"}}

During the war meeting, Daario attempted to flirt with her. When the battle began, Ser Barristan remained behind to guard Dany, fulfilling his duty as a Queensguard. During that night, Jorah, Daario and the Grey Worm infiltrated the city and fought their way through the slave soldiers guarding the city. Within a few hours, Targaryen forces had captured Yunkai.","Horrified, Daenerys meets with Missandei and Grey Worm in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of Meereen. Grey Worm reports that Drogon was last seen flying over the black cliffs three days ago, but he can no longer be found. Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons, Daenerys tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city. Later, she leads her remaining two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, into the catacombs, where they are distracted by sheep carcasses. As they are feeding, Daenerys personally locks huge iron collars around their necks, which are secured by heavy chains. She weeps as she does so, as it is symbolically reducing her remaining \"children\" to chained-up slaves themselves. Daenerys wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place.","Upon the suggestion of Daario, Dany decides to round up each of the leaders of Meereen's noble families, including Hizdahr zo Loraq. Bringing the eight of them down to the catacombs where Viserion and Rhaegal reside, Dany, with the enforcement of the Unsullied, forces the leaders forwards towards the dragons until one of them is burned alive and then brutally torn apart.

She is immediately pardoned for siding with Stannis and says that Daenerys may have something to do with the prophecy of The Prince That Was Promised and, after Daenerys points out that she was \"no prince\" (causing Missandei to insert that, in the language Melisandre used, the prophecy refers gender-neutrally), Melisandre further states her supposition of Dany's half-role to it and that Jon Snow is the other half of it; a name Tyrion knows all too well, having met Jon at the Wall, and surprised to know of Jon's ascension. Varys asks about him, and Daenerys learns of his role as King in the North and Daenerys requests that Tyrion write a letter to Jon, after Tyrion tells her that Jon will prove himself a valuable ally in Dany's bid to claim the Iron Throne from Cersei, asking him to come to Dragonstone and bend the knee (unaware that Jon is actually her nephew by blood).","There is a range of promotional images and screen captures featuring Daenerys in the gallery.","The role of Daenerys was originally played by Tamzin Merchant in the unaired pilot episode, but the role was recast for the actual series for undisclosed reasons.","Daenerys wears Dothraki clothing again for much of Season 6, but after returning to and securing Meereen, she retains her previous style, but wears black instead of white. Black and red are the colors of House Targaryen. Daenerys has rarely worn her House colors since her journey began, so her wearing black now is the ultimate expression of her acceptance of her identity as a Targaryen conquerer and the rightful queen of Westeros.","The series, however, appears to suggest that Daenerys might in fact have some actual fireproofing ability. In addition to the bath scene in \"Winter is Coming\", Daenerys doesn't notice the heat from the brazier in \"A Golden Crown\", and notably, her hands are unburnt, while Irri's are blistered immediately after picking up the egg. It could be argued that she displayed this ability again in \"Valar Morghulis\", when she has her dragons burn down the House of the Undying, although it's possible that the dragons managed to just aim the fire past Daenerys at Pyat Pree (notice her clothes are intact after this incident). Most glaring however, is Daenerys's stunt at the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, from which she emerges again unburnt. In the \"Inside the Episode\" feature for \"Book of the Stranger\", Weiss and Benioff imply that Daenerys does indeed have this ability in some fashion, although she only decided to exploit it after Jorah and Daario showed up.","Daenerys does not appear to have a particular religious affiliation in the books. She grew up in the Free Cities, which have a more diverse religious composition than Westeros, so she has been exposed to several different religions but finds them to be confusing. Her final chapter in the third novel (A Storm of Swords - Daenerys VI) begins with an inner narration from her POV in which she ponders aspects of different religions. The Targaryens converted to the Faith of the Seven when Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros three hundred years ago, and the ancient Valyrian religion is long extinct. Daenerys's brother Viserys apparently made some effort to explain the basic principles of the Faith of the Seven to her, considering that he hoped they would one day rule again over the Seven Kingdoms, where it is the dominant religion - but Daenerys thinks that the concept of a single god who is split into seven facets is confusing. She is also aware of the Lord of Light religion, given that it is the most popular religion in the Free Cities, but she thinks that its belief in a constant violent struggle between R'hllor and the Great Other to be too violent. Daenerys therefore has no particularly strong religious affiliations, but is fairly open-minded to the religions of new peoples she meets in Essos. While not outright \"converting\" to the Great Stallion religion of the Dothraki, after marrying Drogo out of love for her husband's god she finds herself praying to the great horse in the sky at times, even after Drogo's death. Still, Daenerys isn't particularly sure what her personal beliefs are. The TV series doesn't spend much time on this question either."],"name":"Daenerys Targaryen","description":"Daenerys is polite and well-spoken, but filled with quiet determination. She used to be cowed by her brother's ambitions and his occasional cruel rages, but her time amongst the Dothraki has taught her pride, confidence and skills of command. She is still somewhat naive of the world due to being young and living her life as an exile (with only her petulant brother to rely on for knowledge), but she is intelligent and quick to understand now that she is free to pursue her own path.\n\nDaenerys spent her entire life living on the sufferance of others, bouncing back and forth between one benefactor or the next (like Illyrio Mopatis) with her brother, until whatever dreams they had of supporting the exiles' claim wore off and they'd have to move on to another patron. As a result, Daenerys has never known a true home. Constantly living under her brother's domination has given Daenerys a great empathy with the downtrodden of the world. She is deeply sympathetic to those she perceives as oppressed, while at the same time, her pent-up frustration from years of being mentally and physically dominated by her petty would-be-king of a brother make Daenerys capable of being utterly ruthless against those she perceives as oppressing others. This has produced a large amount of black-white thinking in Daenerys's mind, and she can be idealistic to a fault. For example, on seeing the plight of the slaves in Slaver's Bay, Daenerys becomes determined that she must free all of the slaves in the region - with little thought devoted to the practical after-effects which will result from this. A particular example is when the Great Masters of Meereen crucified 163 children as she approached the city, in an attempt to intimidate her. After she took the city, instead of pardoning the slave-masters, she had 163 of them crucified in retribution, including many who opposed the crucifixion of the children, unconcerned about any negative political fallout which would result.\n\nDaenerys has also shown herself to be quite vengeful on several occasions to certain individuals for various grievances. When Mirri Maz Duur tricked her into allowing her to use blood magic to \"save\" Drogo, Daenerys had her bound and burnt alive. Upon learning the role that Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Doreah played in the theft of her dragons, she had them both locked in an empty vault. She is also responsible for the deaths of Randyll and Dickon Tarly after she had them burned alive as well for being her opposition. This quality might have further soured her reputation in Westeros along with Cersei's anti-Daenerys propaganda. However, it is worth noting that she executed them only after offering them the choice of surrender, which they declined. Although she has certainly become more ruthless overtime, unlike her father Daenerys has never acted with deliberate cruelty; when she executes her enemies she does so swiftly, rather than torturing them to death for amusement, as Aerys did.\n\nUnlike many in her House, Daenerys has thus far not exhibited the \"Targaryen madness\" that plagued her father (and to a lesser extent, Viserys). She can be ruthless to her perceived enemies, but while Viserys was cruel and demanding to his servants and even his benefactors, Daenerys reciprocates the loyalty of those who follow her with gratitude and compassion, especially her inner circle of friends and her dragons. On the other hand, insanity was often a late-onset condition in the Targaryens, and it remains to be seen how Daenerys's mentality develops as she matures. One could argue that burning the remaining men of House Tarly with dragonfire could be a telltale sign of Targaryen madness, however both were men in open rebellion to her who refused to bend the knee, thus making the distinction different.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daenerys_Targaryen"}}

He is a legendary figure known both in the Seven Kingdoms and among the Free Folk dwelling Beyond the Wall."],"name":"Night's King","description":"In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Night's King was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch during its earliest years, not long after the Long Night ended and the Wall was completed. He is considered a legendary, half-mythical figure, not far removed from Bran the Builder. If he really did exist, it was almost eight thousand years ago - consider that while the Night's King was the thirteenth Lord Commander, at the time of the War of the Five Kings, Jeor Mormont is the 997th Lord Commander.\n\nHowever, the Night's King fell in love with a woman \"with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars\"; he loved her though \"her skin was cold as ice\", and when he gave his seed to her he gave her his soul as well. He brought her to the Nightfort and bound the brothers of the Night's Watch to his will through sorcery. He declared himself \"Night's King\" and ruled over the Wall and the Gift as his own. The King in the North and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces to defeat him.\n\nAfter he was killed, it was discovered that he had been making human sacrifices to the Others - the White Walkers - and all records of him were destroyed, and uttering his name was forbidden, so it became lost to history. Nevertheless, it is believed he may have been a Bolton, a Magnar of Skagos, an Umber, a Flint, a Norrey, or a Woodfoot, though Old Nan claims to know a version of the tale where he was actually a Stark, brother to the King-in-the-North, named Bran.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Night's King, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along the Wall should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of the Night's King also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not \"rule\" the Wall but who serve the realms of men.\n\nWhen the leader of the White Walkers (first seen in \"Oathkeeper\") was dubbed the Night King by the producers, confusion set in amongst some fans as to the relationship between two characters. After \"Hardhome\" aired, Game of Thrones Wiki contacted George R.R. Martin asking whether to treat the White Walker referred to as the \"Night King\" relative to the ancient Lord Commander known as the \"Night's King\" - if they are the same character, or if \"Night's King\" is a title that can be held by different characters, like \"King in the North.\" He was also asked if it was significant that Benioff and Weiss refer to him as the \"Night King\", without a possessive \"S\". Martin cryptically avoided the first question, but said he prefers the spelling \"Night's King\":\n\n\"The Door\" revealed that the Night King was \"created\" by the Children of the Forest during their war with the First Men (i.e., before the Night's Watch was founded). This would suggest they are indeed separate characters.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Night%27s_King"}}

Loras Tyrell was briefly the Lord Commander of the Rainbow Guard, as Renly called his Kingsguard.\n\nUnlike several other offices on the Small Council the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard cannot be lawfully dismissed, or at least not totally dismissed from the Kingsguard, because their vows are taken for life. Theoretically a king might appoint one of the other six Kingsguard members as the new Lord Commander to replace him, but it is unknown if this has ever happened.\n\nWhile reading through the White Book, Jaime notes that most of the Kingsguard served adequately, but few people remember their names generations later. The only ones people remember centuries later are those who were the best (great heroes such as Aemon the Dragonknight), and those who were the worst (either traitors to the crown or those who were derelict in their duty, broke their vows and fathered children). Jaime also notes that on rare occasion, some of the past Lord Commanders were a bit of both, particularly Ser Criston Cole, perhaps the most infamous Kingsguard member who ever lived until Jaime himself. He started out as a favorite of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, serving as Lord Commander of her father Viserys I's Kingsguard, but eventually had a falling out, and he joined her enemies at court. Conflicting stories from the banal to the lurid and extreme exist about exactly what happened between them, ranging from that Criston was too noble to break his vows of chastity, to that he eagerly offered to flee with her to the Free Cities as a common sellsword, but Rhaenyra thought that only a Kinsguard was worthy of her. Others say that it was actually Rhaenyra who threw herself at Criston, attempting to sexually seduce him and desperate to lose her virginity to him rather than in her arranged marriage to her homosexual cousin Laenor Velaryon - after which he grew disgusted and spurned her, and she took Harwin Strong as a new lover. Whatever the cause, Criston joined the rival faction at court championing her half-brother Aegon II, and upon the death of her father, was an active leader in the conspiracy, personally slitting the throat of the Master of Coin when he protested crowning Aegon II instead of Rhaenyra. Cole then personally placed the crown on Aegon II's head at his coronation, and was forever after remembered as \"the Kingmaker\". Some say that Cole supported Aegon II in the civil war that followed out of petty revenge against Rhaenyra, while some say he did it out of respect for Andal laws which place a son before a daughter in inheritance (despite the fact that her father had repeatedly and publicly made the high lords of the realm swear that Rhaenyra would rule after him). Still others say that Criston had no great love of Aegon II, yet was not driven out of petty hatred for Rhaenyra, but rather because he had honestly concluded that Rhaenyra was too unstable to rule (particularly due to her new husband Daemon Targaryen), and that the Small Council could more easily control Aegon II as a puppet ruler.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lord_Commander_of_the_Kingsguard"}}

However, Criston was prepared and had his archers and scorpions fire at Meleys. The dragon was largely unharmed by these attacks, and she responded by burning Criston's soldiers with dragonfire."],"name":"Siege of Rook's Rest","description":"During the Dance of the Dragons, Jacaerys Velaryon had made allies out of House Stark and House Arryn, the furious Aegon II Targaryen removed his grandfather Otto Hightower from his position as Hand of the King, and appointed his Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Ser Criston Cole. To prove his worth to his King, Criston decided to burn every castle that had declared for the Blacks, and first set his army on the coastal stronghold of Rook's Rest, with both the Greens army and the Kingsguard, marching North.\n\nThe Lord of Rook's Rest saw the approach of the army before they had a chance to pillage, so he sent a raven to Rhaenyra Targaryen, begging for help. For days, he saw his fields and villages burning, locked within his castle, Rook's Rest overtaken by the enemy, with no response for Rhaenyra. However, instead of the Blacks army, she sent her former mother-in-law Rhaenys Targaryen, atop her dragon Meleys. She burned the Green army with joy, as her ancestor Rhaenys Targaryen had done before her at the Field of Fire. However, the Greens had set a trap, and Rhaenys was ambushed. Two other dragons rose into the sky to attack Rhaenys and Meleys, first Aemond Targaryen on the oldest and largest of dragons, Vhagar. After, Aegon on the most magnificent of dragons, Sunfyre. However, Rhaenys didn't flee, and instead fought the dragons head on, until there was so much dragonflame in the sky, that it seemed like there was a second sun. When the smoke had settled, Meleys had been torn apart by the other two dragons and Rhaenys was a pile of ash. Aemond and Vhagar were the only ones uninjured, while Aegon and Sunfyre were mortally wounded.\n\nThis led to Aegon having to have a constant dose of Milk of the poppy in order to survive, which could have been the cause of his madness, or could have just added to the fact that he had the Targaryen madness.\n\nMeanwhile, Rhaenyra was frightened by this defeat, fearing that she had lost one of her best fighters and allies. She sent her youngest sons away to Essos, in order to protect them from the dangers awaiting, but this led to another battle.\n\nSer Criston Cole, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and the new Hand to King Aegon II Targaryen, devised a more aggressive strategy than his predecessor as Hand, Ser Otto Hightower. Criston's force of greens sacked Duskendale and planned a trap for the blacks at Rook's Rest.\n\nLord Staunton closed the gates of Rook's Rest, but was unable to prevent Criston from burning his fields or killing hissmallfolk and livestock. He asked for assistance from Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen by sending a raven toDragonstone.\n\nThe loss of both Rhaenys Targaryen and her dragon, Meleys, was a severe blow to the blacks. Rhaenys's husband, the Sea Snake Corlys Velaryon, was enraged and blamed her death on Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, stating that if the queen or her sons had gone with their dragons, his wife might be alive. The heads of Lord Staunton and Meleys were taken to King's Landing.\n\nSer Criston Cole lost 800 soldiers to Meleys's dragonfire. King Aegon II Targaryen was incapacitated by his burns for a year; Prince Aemond Targaryen became regent while his brother recovered. Aegon's injured dragon, Sunfyre, was left behind and ate carcasses and livestock. Lord Walys Mooton successfully recaptured Rook's Rest for the blacks, then was slain in a failed attempt to kill Sunfyre.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Siege_of_Rook%27s_Rest"}}

She later married Corlys Velaryon, and the two had at least one son, Laenor Velaryon, who would later marry Rhaenys's niece Rhaenyra Targaryen.

When Laenor died, Rhaenyra married her uncle and Rhaenys's brother Daemon and had two more sons by him, Aegon and Viserys.\n\nWhen her father Viserys died, Rhaenyra was expected to ascend the Iron Throne, since her father did not change the succession when he had a son.

Osha's death scene does flow logically for the situation in the episode itself - as Ramsay says, Theon would have told him everything about the Stark boys' escape under torture, so he'd know that Osha was specifically trying to seduce him to kill him."],"name":"Osha","description":"Osha is a wildling spearwife, one of the \"Free Folk\" who live north of the Wall. Like other wildlings, she worships the Old Gods of the Forest. Due to the rising threat of the White Walkers and their undead wights, Osha fled south of the Wall with a group of other wildlings, hoping to go \"as far south as south goes\". They bypass the wall by taking a boat across the Bay of Seals, to the east of the Wall.\n\nOsha joins Stiv and Wallen to form a band of wildlings. They fled south and abandoned their service to Mance Rayder. The group cross the Wall and travelled into the Wolfswood north of Winterfell. They chance upon Bran Stark and try to steal his horse. Robb Stark intervened, killing Wallen and taking Osha prisoner. Stiv held Bran at knifepoint, but was shot in the back by Theon Greyjoy. Osha surrendered to Robb and was taken to Winterfell.\n\nOsha is put to work as a servant. Theon is irritated when she refused to call him \"My lord,\" especially when she correctly pointed out that his father is still alive so he is not entitled to the honorific title yet. Maester Luwin sent Theon away and asks Osha why she was south of the Wall. She replied that there were things sleeping under the ice which are not sleeping any more. Luwin is skeptical of her claims.\n\nOsha goes to Winterfell's godswood to pray to the Old Gods of the Forest, and found Bran there. She tells him that north of the Wall, the old gods are the only gods. She also says that Robb was leading his army in the wrong direction. The true enemy lay to the north, beyond the Wall, not the south. When Hodor passed by naked, Osha remarks he must have giants' blood in him, and tells Bran that giants - and worse - exist north of the Wall.\n\nBran dreamt that he saw his father Ned in the catacombs of Winterfell. Osha carried Bran into the tombs to check. Once inside they are surprised by Shaggydog and found Rickon there too: he had experienced the same dream as well. When they emerge from the tomb Luwin told the boys that their father has been killed.\n\nOsha continued to discuss Bran Stark's strange dreams with him. He denied having had any more but nevertheless insists on being taken to the pool in the Godswood. She correctly predicted that the Red Comet signified the return of Dragons to the world. Bran told Osha that he has dreamt of seeing a Three-eyed raven but she offered no explanation. He also confided that he had experienced a dream about the sea coming to Winterfell and drowning Ser Rodrik Cassel. Ser Rodrik left Winterfell to relieve a siege of nearby Torrhen's Square by unknown forces.\n\nThe siege was in reality a feint orchestrated by Theon Greyjoy to draw away Winterfell's defenders. Theon infiltrated and seized the castle forcing Bran to surrender and yield Winterfell to him. Later, Osha offered to fight for Theon but he refused, suspecting treachery. Osha was also present with Bran and Rickon when Theon personally executed Ser Rodrik in public. She comforted the boys and told Bran that his dream has come true.\n\nLater that night, Osha seduced Theon, claiming that she wanted her freedom. After he fell asleep, she escapes with Bran, Rickon, and Hodor, killing the guard Drennan as they make their exit. They walked to a shepherd's farm in the Stark lands. They consider approaching the farmer for food. Theon tracked them to the farm using hounds and then loses their scent. He returns to Winterfell with the charred corpses of two boys, claiming they are Bran and Rickon. He made no mention of Osha and Hodor. The escapees actually doubled back, using a stream to mask their scent and were hiding under Theon's nose in the crypts of Winterfell. Luwin spotted Osha smuggling bread into the catacombs and followed her. She explained their escape and Luwin told her that the bodies must be those of the orphan farmhands. She promised not to tell the boys, agreeing that they have suffered enough.\n\nLater, Roose Bolton's bastard son Ramsay Bolton launched a siege of Winterfell. Theon was betrayed by his own men who turned him in return for safe passage to the Iron Islands.\n\nHowever, Ramsay reneged on his promise and had them flayed alive. He then took Theon prisoner and sacked Winterfell, killing many of its inhabitants and sacking much of the castle. Since they were hiding under the catacombs, Osha, Bran, Rickon and Hodor managed to evade capture. Before leaving Winterfell for the north, Osha encountered a dying Maester Luwin and used a dagger upon his request to give him the \"gift of mercy\". Luwin instructed Osha to escort Bran and Rickon to the Wall so that they can find their half-brother, Jon Snow. Osha agreed and left Winterfell with Hodor, Bran, Rickon and their direwolves.\n\nFleeing from Winterfell, Bran's group encountered Jojen and Meera Reed. Jojen approaches their camp unarmed but Osha sneaked up on him with a sharpened stake. However, she was surprised by his sister Meera who had sneaked up behind her, and held a knife to her throat. Bran insisted that everyone calm down. Jojen claimed that he received greensight visions which told him where to find Bran, and that he would need their help. The group continued to travel north to Castle Black, as Maester Luwin instructed, hopefully to find Jon Snow.\n\nFueled by the long animosity of the Northerners and Free Folk towards each other, Osha and Meera get into an argument about which of them can skin a rabbit better, which turns to who is doing the hunting, to arguing about who trusts whom. Bran again tells them to make peace. Jojen then starts shaking violently in his sleep, and Meera holds down his tongue with a cord so he doesn't bite himself. She explains that the visions take their toll. Osha dislikes this, thinking it is black magic. On waking, Jojen says that he saw Jon Snow - and that he isn't at Castle Black, but on the north side of the Wall, and surrounded by enemies.\n\nOsha's pent-up frustration comes to a head, and she says she doesn't want Jojen influencing Bran with black magic anymore. Bran explains that because Jojen's vision said Jon Snow isn't even at Castle Black, they shouldn't head there anymore. Instead, Bran and Jojen believe that the Three-eyed raven in his dreams is leading him Beyond the Wall, so they should head directly north to the structure, instead of turning to head to Castle Black. Bran says that he believes that maybe the gods meant for him to find the three-eyed raven, meant for him to have these visions, and ultimately, his fall from the tower that crippled him happened for a reason. Osha is outraged and says she will never go back north of the Wall again.\n\nOsha then explained to them the reason she fled south of the Wall. She once had a husband named Bruni, a good man who loved her. One day he disappeared, and everyone said he'd simply left her, but she knew him better than that. One night he did return to their hut - as an undead wight, with skin pale as a dead man's and his eyes bluer than clear sky. Bruni began to choke her. Somehow she managed to get hold of a knife, and rammed it deep into his heart, but he didn't even seem to notice. Osha ultimately managed to get away by burning down their hut with Bruni inside it. She didn't ask the gods for that, she says, but their message was clear: north of the Wall is no place for living men to be anymore.\n\nEventually, Osha and her masters reached The Gift, a region south of the Wall which was considered to be beyond the borders of the Seven Kingdoms. The Gift had been gifted to the Night's Watch thousands of years ago by Brandon the Builder, from which the Watch draws support for its material needs. While the region was fertile, it was uninhabited due to frequent Wildling attacks which had forced the Smallfolk to migrate south over the centuries. Bran's discussion of this history and Rickon's remarks about Wildlings drinking blood caused Osha some discomfort since she was a Free Folk. That evening, the party took shelter at an abandoned mill to escape a thunderstorm. Later, the group observed a band of Wildlings chasing down a lone Northman. During the ensuing incident, Bran used his Warg powers to Warg through Summer and Shaggydog and fight off the Wildlings. This party of Wildlings included Rickon\u2019s half-brother Jon Snow, who earlier had been taken captive by the Free Folk. Using his Warg abilities, Bran helped Snow to escape from his captors and return to the Night's Watch.\n\nLater that night, Bran arranged for Osha to bring Rickon to the holdfast of Greatjon Umber, the Lord of Last Hearth and the head of House Umber. Lord Umber was a loyal ally of the Starks. While Rickon was upset to be separated from his brother, he realized this was for his own good and cooperated with Bran and Osha. This arrangement also suited Osha because she was unwilling to travel with Bran and company due to the threat posed by the White Walkers. During their journey to Greatjon Umber, Rickon and Osha were accompanied by the former\u2019s direwolf Shaggydog. Meanwhile, Bran, Hodor, Jojen Reed, and Meera Reed head beyond the Wall.\n\nOsha and Rickon are betrayed by the Umbers when the new Lord of Last Hearth, Smalljon Umber, wants to protect his lands from the wildlings that have been given safe passage through the Wall by Jon Snow. Lord Umber still makes it clear that he hates the Boltons and that he will not pledge allegiance to them. However, to gain Ramsay Bolton's support, he offers him Osha and Rickon Stark. At first, Ramsay does not wholly believe the boy to be truly Rickon. When the Smalljon presents him with the head of Rickon's direwolf, Shaggydog, Ramsay sarcastically welcomes Rickon home.\n\nRamsay later has Osha brought to him, and asks her about her involvement with House Stark. Osha pretends to have been a slave and says that she carried around Rickon to find a buyer for him. She also tries to seduce Ramsay, but it was only a ruse to get him distracted and kill him with the knife that was in the table next to him. As Osha lies on his lap, Ramsay reveals that Theon had told him how she helped the Stark boys escape. Osha rushes for the knife, but Ramsay takes another one out from his holster and stabs her in the neck. A surprised Osha falls to the floor and quickly bleeds to death while clutching her wound, as Ramsay cleans the blade and watches in amusement, returning to peeling and eating his apple with the knife he laid on the table before.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Osha"}}

The Dothraki are fierce warriors, skilled in battle, unrelenting in combat and known for savagery towards non-Dothraki. Amongst their own people they have a code of honor, albeit still a harsh and unforgiving one. Drogo was very young to have his own khalasar, particularly such a large one. He is a legendary warrior and has never been defeated in battle. Drogo desired the most beautiful and exotic woman in the world as his khaleesi or wife, and enlisted Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos to help him find such a woman.","Daenerys asks Drogo to continue with the invasion, but with his obligation to Viserys gone, Drogo is reluctant to attempt to cross the Narrow Sea because of his people's fear of the \"poison water\" (the sea, which the Dothraki fear, because they distrust any liquid that a horse will not drink) and \"wooden horses\" (ships). Ser Jorah later saves Daenerys from an assassin sent by King Robert. Learning of the attempt, Drogo rewards Jorah with any horse he desires from Drogo's own herd. Drogo swears a blood oath that he will punish Westeros for their attempt on the life of his wife and child, lead the Dothraki beyond the poison water to invade the Seven Kingdoms and seat his son on the \"Iron Chair\" of Westeros.","Daenerys sees Drogo in her visions when she visits the House of the Undying. She sees him in the tent they once shared, holding a small child in his arms, their son Rhaego. They share an emotional reunion but she chooses to leave, knowing that they are dead and only an illusion.","The news of Drogo's death has spread throughout Essos. While attempting to sell Jorah Mormont to slavers, Malko incorrectly claims that Jorah killed Drogo in single combat (most likely, on purpose to increase the bidding).","After Daenerys is captured by Khal Moro and his khalasar, he implies he intends on raping her. Realizing they don't know who she is, Daenerys tells him that she is the wife of Drogo, the son of Bharbo. Upon hearing this, Moro renounced his intentions, as it is forbidden in the Dothraki to bed the wife or widow of a khal.","Drogo is mentioned by Daenerys and Tyrion Lannister when they are discussing Jon Snow. She complains about how heroic men \u201Cdo stupid things [and] die\u201D, citing Drogo\u2019s actions an example, alongside Daario Naharis, Jorah Mormont and Jon himself. Tyrion points out that all these men fell in love with her, suggesting Jon is also developing feelings for Daenerys. Later, when Daenerys is speaking with Jon about how she cannot have children, he asks her who exactly told her she couldn\u2019t. Daenerys replies \u201CThe witch who murdered my husband.\u201D","* vision of Daenerys","Spoken by Drogo","Of note is his treatment of Daenerys on their wedding night, which is significantly more sensitive than in the TV series, including explicitly asking her permission with the word \"No?\", to which Daenerys replies \"Yes.\""],"name":"Drogo","description":"In battle, Drogo is known for his savagery, brutality, and lack of relent or remorse to his opponents. The fearsome khal had never been defeated in combat and because of this his braid reached down below his waist. Indeed, Drogo was ruthless in battle and highly skilled, able to kill an armed man in seconds flat with just his bare hands. Initially, he had no problems with rape, slavery or murder, but every action he makes is because of his devotion to the Dothraki and reclaiming what is theirs. He was utterly fearless to the point of recklessness - when Mago holds an arakh to his chest, he does not react, only moving closer to his opponent, deepening the wound, to show his courage and disdain for his opponent, before openly disarming himself and outmatching the mutinous Dothraki effectively unarmed, though the wound eventually caused his excruciating death.\n\nDespite his extremely violent, at times cruel nature within battle, Drogo reveals a completely different compassionate and gentle side which only surfaces around his wife, Daenerys Targaryen. Though he seemed initially unmoved with his betrothal to Daenerys and the rough consummation on the eve of their wedding, he grew to respect her due to her spirit, determination, and role as khaleesi. As Daenerys learned more of Dothraki culture and language, and Drogo learned more about her, theirs grew into a marriage of equals, and they settled happily some two months in. His caring side was visible when he rushed to see if Daenerys was unharmed after an unsuccessful assassination attempt, rather than immediately executing the wine seller who attempted to poison her and her unborn child.\n\nHis soft side for Daenerys can also clash with his own savage nature, as noted when he ripped the tongue out of Mago's throat for calling Daenerys a \"foreign whore\" (although he could have also killed him just for challenging Drogo in the first place), and again when he killed Viserys Targaryen only after the drunken prince threatened to cut Daenerys open and remove her child. He went against years of Dothraki belief and superstition by vowing to take the Iron Throne for his wife and unborn son by travelling across the Narrow Sea, even though the Dothraki have feared salt water for years.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Drogo"}}

When Queen Cersei reorganized the small council after Tyrion murdered their father Tywin, she took control over the council and stacked it with sycophants. One of her actions was to appoint Qyburn as the new Master of Whisperers - despite the fact that he is a disgraced former maester who was expelled from the Citadel after it was learned he was conducting human experimentation, dissecting living men. Cersei ignored Grand Maester Pycelle's objections to this controversial choice- including asking what qualifications Qyburn even had for such a post - by simply saying that he had demonstrated his loyalty to her, more than Varys ever did. Minutes after this announcement, along with Cersei's other choices in restaffing the council, her uncle Kevan Lannister bluntly declared that she was stacking the Small Council with sycophants, and left for Casterly Rock in disgust."],"name":"Master of Whisperers","description":"In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Varys was Master of Whisperers under King Aerys II Targaryen at the time of Robert's Rebellion. He cautioned the king not to let Tywin Lannister's army within the gates, but Grand Maester Pycelle (secretly Tywin's agent) convinced the Mad King that Tywin had come to turn the tide of the war back in his favor, and to let his army inside the gates. As soon as the army entered the Lannisters turned on the Targaryens, in the destructive Sack of King's Landing. After Robert Baratheon was crowned king, he pardoned Varys and kept him in his position as Master of Whisperers, which he would maintain through the rest of Robert's rule. Thus, by the beginning of the narrative, Varys has been the head of the realm's spy network for over twenty years. It is unknown specifically why Robert pardoned Varys, let alone kept him in such a sensitive position, though it may simply be because he was very good at his job. In truth, this was very detrimental to Robert, as Varys secretly remains a Targaryen loyalist, in contact with Illyrio Mopatis in orchestrating the affairs of Prince Viserys Targaryen, and the marriage of his sister Princess Daenerys Targaryen to Khal Drogo, although the only Small Councilors who ever learned the truth did so in their last moments of life.\n\nDuring his time as Hand of the King, Brynden \"Bloodraven\" Rivers was also the Master of Whisperers. Since he had lost his left eye in his duel against his half-brother Aegor \"Bittersteel\" Rivers in the Battle of Redgrass Field, this inspired the saying \"How many eyes does Lord Bloodraven have? A thousand eyes, and one.\"\n\nThe World of Ice and Fire sourcebook (2014) mentions other masters of whisperers in passing. The Targaryens actually had a long unofficial tradition of recruiting unpopular Masters of Whisperers from the Free Cities, so Varys's situation is actually not that unusual. The other prominent holders of the office were actually Mistresses of Whisperers, being women who seem to have held the title openly (and were also actual mistresses to the kings in question).\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Master_of_Whisperers"}}

Her name was first given in on-screen dialogue in the Season 6 premiere.","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Septa Unella is described as big boned with callused hands and a scowling homely face. She is a member of the Most Devout, a council of septons and septas that rule the Faith of the Seven under the leadership of the High Septon."],"name":"Unella","description":"Unella grabs Cersei Lannister when she is arrested by the High Sparrow and throws her into a cell underneath the Great Sept of Baelor with the aid of Moelle and Scolera.\n\nUnella routinely visits Cersei in her cell and offers her a ladle of water on the condition that she confess. Cersei, prideful and infuriated, refuses Unella's advances, repeating to the septa that her face will be the last one she sees before she dies.\n\nEventually, however, Cersei gives in and confesses her adultery with her cousin Lancel. The High Sparrow allows Cersei to return to the Red Keep in order to be with her son King Tommen, but first she must perform a walk of atonement. Unella is present when Cersei is stripped naked and washed by two other septas before her hair is roughly cut short. She later accompanies Cersei as she is forced to walk naked from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep with a handful of Faith Militant members to keep away the leering and jeering crowds who have gathered to see her shame and take the chance to insult a Queen. As she walks, Septa Unella accompanies her crying out \"Shame!\" repeatedly while ringing a bell to attract the attention of the population.\n\nWhile Septa Unella reads from the Seven Pointed Star regarding sin to an imprisoned Margaery Tyrell, the latter inquires about her brother Loras Tyrell's condition, who was likewise imprisoned. However, Unella says she must confess her sins first. When the Queen demands to know the condition her brother is in, the septa moves to strike her, much to Margaery's horror. At that precise moment, the High Sparrow steps in and stops Unella, ordering his acolyte to attend the Faith's 'other guests'. After the septa leaves, he admits that at times Septa Unella takes her devotion too far.\n\nSome time later, Unella brings Margaery to the High Sparrow. When Margaery correctly recognizes the High Sparrow paraphrasing his life from the Book of the Stranger, he expresses surprise, and Margaery explains that Unella frequently reads the Book at her. The High Sparrow chuckles and agrees that Unella has a habit of reading at people instead of to them.\n\nUnella is present on the steps of the Great Sept as Margaery is about to do her walk of atonement, likely with the intent of again ringing the bell. She remains silent throughout the Tyrell army's aborted rescue attempt and Tommen's announcement of a new alliance between the Faith and the Crown.\n\nUnella has apparently been assigned to watch over Queen Margaery non-stop. The septa is naturally present when Olenna and her granddaughter are finally reunited, much to the Tyrell matriarch's ire. The Queen Of Thorns wastes no time in telling Unella off and even tries to intimidate her.\n\nUnella is made of sterner stuff though and remains implacable. When Margaery reveals she is 'truly' devoted to the Faith, to her grandmother's shock a hint of a smile appears across Unella's lips.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Sept of Baelor with Wildfire, Cersei has Unella imprisoned within the Red Keep's dungeons and restrained on a rack. After tormenting Unella by pouring wine on her face, the Queen confesses that she killed Robert Baratheon, that she had commited incest with her brother and bore his children, and that she destroyed the Sept, killing the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant. Cersei accuses Unella of not truly caring about Cersei's atonement when Cersei was imprisoned by the Faith Militant; rather, Unella tortured Cersei solely for her own sick satisfaction. Cersei then reminds Unella that she told her that her face would be the last thing she sees before she dies, and Unella responds that she is ready to die today. However, Cersei taunts her that she will not actually die today, not for a very long time (she intends to have her slowly tortured). She then introduces Unella to Ser Gregor Clegane and leaves the two inside the cell, as Unella screams in horror when she sees what is beneath Gregor's helmet. As Cersei locks the door and leaves she mockingly chants \"Shame! Shame!

Later, while Daenerys is staying at Qarth, she teaches Drogon to breathe fire for the first time, roasting a small piece of meat, which he then eats. Drogon and his siblings are kidnapped to the dismay of Daenerys. In a meeting with the Thirteen, Pyat Pree, a warlock, reveals he has taken them to the House of the Undying and claims that he is eager to reunite Daenerys with her children.\n\nAfter Daenerys enters the House of the Undying, she eventually finds her three dragons chained to a small dais. Pyat Pree suddenly appears and chains Daenerys with magic, saying that her dragons make his magic strong, that she makes the dragons stronger, and thus she must stay in the House of the Undying forever.\n\nAn unconcerned Daenerys whispers \"dracarys\" to Drogon, and after a couple of tries, he spits a large plume of fire at Pyat, igniting the warlock's robes. The other two dragons follow their brother's lead and the three of them burn Pyat Pree alive, free themselves and Daenerys from their chains, and set the House of the Undying alight.\n\nDrogon has grown significantly since leaving Qarth, and is about the size of a small dog by the time Daenerys and her party reach Astapor. He swoops into the water and catches a fish, which he then cooks in mid-air and devours. Daenerys notes that he is not growing fast enough for her to use him to conquer the Seven Kingdoms in the immediate future.\n\nAt Slaver's Bay, she speaks with Kraznys mo Nakloz, as they attempt to work out a deal for his slave soldiers, the Unsullied. Daenerys says she will take all eight thousand Unsullied, including those in training. To this Kraznys laughs at her and says even with the wealth she possesses she could afford hardly over one hundred Unsullied. Daenerys surprises him by reminding him she has Dragons, and she will give him one. They strike a deal that she may have all the Unsullied, as well as those still in training, in exchange for her biggest dragon.\n\nSometime later the exchange is made, and Daenerys meets with the Good Masters and gives the chained Drogon over to Kraznys, who in turn gives her the golden scourge which signifies absolute authority over the Unsullied. Once the Unsullied are under her command, Kraznys angrily comments that Drogon does not obey him, to which she responds, in Valyrian, that he does not obey because dragons are not slaves. Daenerys orders Kraznys's death with a harsh \"dracarys\". Drogon then takes flight and strafes the guards and Good Masters in the walls above the plaza.\n\nAfter the Sack of Astapor is finished, Daenerys's khalasar and her new Unsullied army march out of the city, Drogon and his brothers flying overhead.\n\nDrogon and his brothers are present in Daenerys' tent when a Wise Master from Yunkai arrives to entreat with their mother. Drogon, now about the size of a large dog, aggressively barks at the Master when he gets too close to Daenerys. Later, the Wise Master has two slaves place a chest full of gold near Drogon. While the two talk, Daenerys throws a piece of meat to Viserion, and Drogon attempts to steal it from his brother. When the negotiation goes sour, Drogon growls at the Wise Master for threatening Daenerys. Scared for his safety, the Wise Master tells his slaves to take back the gold and leave. Drogon stops them in their tracks, hissing and growling.\n\nDrogon and his siblings are now the size of small horses. He quietly rests his head on his mother's lap as she caresses him. When his two siblings come back with a dead lamb, he joins the fight over the carcass. His mother tries to calm him down, and without warning, Drogon snaps at her with a hiss; a warning to not interfere. He then roars and goes to contest the kill. Daenerys is shaken, fearing that she is losing influence over her \"children\", as dragons can never be truly tamed.\n\nOn the run from the Lost Legion, Asher Forrester, his uncle Malcolm Branfield, and partner Beskha encounter Drogon inside a cave, but manage to escape. Asher later reports the find to Daenerys while asking for help, though she does not believe him, even with evidence to support the claim.\n\nFollowing Daenerys's conquest of Meereen, Drogon, who is now the size of a small ship, kills and eats the goats of a local goatherd. The goatherd lays the charred bones of his flock before Daenerys in her throne room, hoping he has not angered the new queen and that this was a form of punishment. Daenerys apologizes for Drogon's actions and promises to pay the goat herder back three times the worth of his lost goats.\n\nDany is later dismayed to learn that Drogon has killed the young daughter of another goatherd. She tearfully confines the two smaller dragons to the catacombs of the pyramid while Drogon remains at large, having last been seen over the Black Cliffs.\n\nDaenerys confides in Daario Naharis that she has no idea where Drogon has flown off to.\n\nAfter the public execution of Mossador, Daenerys encounters an even further grown Drogon, who has become the size of a killer whale, on top of the Great Pyramid. She reaches out to him, but Drogon flies away at the last moment.\n\nDrogon apparently flew west, eventually winding up roving the skies above the shattered ruins of the Valyrian Peninsula, where he was glimpsed by Jorah Mormont and Tyrion Lannister, who were traveling through the region to avoid pirates. Massive and majestic, Drogon's unexpected appearance rendered the typically chatty Tyrion speechless and seeing him again also enraptures Jorah. Drogon's flight unfortunately distracted the pair long enough for them to be attacked by Stone Men.\n\nWhile Daenerys attends the grand re-opening of the fighting pits at the Great Pit of Daznak, a large group of Sons of the Harpy appear and attack her council and the spectators. While trying to escape, Dany and her small group become surrounded by the Sons with no chance of escape. Drogon suddenly appears, flying out of a flame burst and begins to attack, burning the Sons with his fiery breath and crushing them in his massive jaws. Temporarily retreating in terror, the Sons regroup and retaliate by throwing spears at Drogon, wounding him slightly. Dany pulls a spear from Drogon's neck, then climbs on his back to remove another one. She commands him to fly away, and he does so, with Dany on his back.\n\nLater, Drogon lands atop an impressive hill in a sea of green grass. Though Dany tries to convince him to take her back to Meereen, Drogon is still recovering from his wounds and is uninterested in flying back. Daenerys wanders away to find something to eat, but she is quickly surrounded by a Dothraki khalasar.\n\nAt some point following Daenerys's takeover of the Dothraki, she senses Drogon trailing her. She slips away and rides him around the khalasar before landing and giving a rousing speech while mounted on his back. He is significantly larger than he was during the battle in Meereen. Eventually, Drogon carries Dany to the Great Pyramid of Meereen, which is under siege by the Masters.\n\nDaenerys discusses terms of surrender of the masters in Meereen. The masters foolishly mention slaughtering the dragons, which angers their mother. Drogon suddenly appears, lands next to her, and moves one of his wings allowing her to mount his back. As Drogon takes flight, Viserion and Rhaegal break out of the catacombs and join their brother in the sky at last. At Dany's command of \"dracarys\", Drogon leads his brothers in immolating the slaver fleet with dragon fire, decisively ending the Second Siege of Meereen.\n\nSome time later, Drogon and his brothers accompany their mother and her large army on a voyage to retake Westeros by soaring above the armada.\n\nDrogon and his brothers fly ahead of their mother as she lands on Dragonstone. They investigate the island as Daenerys enters and secures the castle.\n\nUpon Jon Snow's arrival at Dragonstone, Drogon and Viserion fly overhead and visibly scare both him and Davos Seaworth. Tyrion then comments that he has not yet got used to them either.\n\nLater, Daenerys, frustrated at her losses, takes Drogon (along with a massive Dothraki horde) to the Reach in a surprise attack on the Lannister forces. The Lannisters are completely unprepared for a combined assault from Dothraki cavalry and dragonfire at the same time, and are quickly overpowered. At Dany's command, Drogon breathes a massive torrent of fire straight through the Lannister ranks from front to back. The Lannister archers attempt to shoot Daenerys off his back, but he banks up, and the arrows bounce harmlessly off his armored underside.\n\nSuddenly, a massive scorpion bolt whizzes past Drogon, startling Daenerys. She looks down to see the scorpion itself, as Bronn reloads it. Drogon sees it too, and charges across the battlefield, but Bronn fires a second bolt straight into Drogon's shoulder. With a screech of agony he plummets towards the ground in freefall, with Daenerys struggling to hold on. However, although the bolt previously punched through a dragon skull, this time, being fired upwards and from a larger distance, it only manages to inflict a flesh wound on its target; Drogon manages to pull himself together before hitting the ground. He hovers in the air right in front of Bronn, who leaps out of the way as the enraged dragon incinerates the scorpion with his fire. He then lands on the battlefield and roars, demolishing what remains of the scorpion with an angry swipe of his tail.\n\nDaenerys then dismounts and attempts to remove the scorpion bolt embedded in Drogon's shoulder. Despite being superficial, the wound is still painful, and Drogon howls in pain and fury as his mother tries to pull it out. Suddenly, Dany sees Jaime Lannister charging towards her with a spear in his hand, hoping to kill her then and there. Unfortunately for Jaime, Drogon sees him too; shielding Daenerys behind his head, he breathes fire at the charging Jaime, who is saved from certain death when Bronn tackles him off his horse and into the river.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Drogon rests on a small hill looking over the surviving Lannister men brought before his mother. Dany offers the remaining men a choice: kneel or die. When most of them refuse, Drogon (as if annoyed by this) roars, frightening many more into bending the knee. After Daenerys's request is denied by Dickon and Randyll, Drogon burns them alive, causing the rest of the surviving soldiers to instantly kneel in fear.  Daenerys's returns to Dragonstone while riding Drogon. Jon watches as they land and remains stoic, even after Drogon roars. Sensing something in Jon, Drogon allows the King in the North to get close enough to pet him; much to the surprise of Dany. After Daenerys dismounts him, Drogon joins his brothers in the skies above Dragonstone. Daenerys remarks how beautiful they are, and though Jon mentions he wouldn't exactly call them that and refers to them as beasts; Daenerys is quick to remind him they are her children.\n\nDrogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion accompany Daenerys beyond the wall to rescue Jon Snow and company beyond the Wall, burning many wights in the process. Viserion is struck in the neck by an icy javelin, courtesy of the Night King, and is brought down, crashing through the frozen lake. Drogon cries out for his dying brother, but can do nothing to help him. Jon is then left behind as Drogon takes to the air, narrowly avoiding a second ice spear from the Night King.\n\nWhen Daenerys goes to parley with the Lannisters in King's Landing, she rides Drogon to the Dragonpit in a show of force.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Drogon"}}

Bronn muses that he never thought he'd end up settling down in a fine a place as this. Confused, Lollys corrects him that after her mother (Tanda Stokeworth) dies, the castle will pass to her sister, because she is older than Lollys. She also says that her sister hates her, calls her names, and even still she pulls Lollys's hair when she thinks their mother isn't looking.

He privately informs Bronn that he needs him to accompany a secret mission he is taking to Dorne. To encourage Bronn to go, the Lannisters have now promised Lollys to Wyllis Bracken: Jaime vaguely promises that they will find Bronn a better bride with an even bigger castle, though Bronn is not amused.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Falyse_Stokeworth"}}

If a boy has his testicles removed before puberty, however, it is difficult to impossible for them to achieve an erection with the remaining shaft of the penis - due to the lack of hormones during the puberty years that would normally be supplied by the testicles. This is a moot point for the Unsullied: both their testicles and penis shaft are removed when they are no more than five years old. Kraznys actually explains within the novels that eunuchs can sometimes achieve an erection if they only have their testicles removed, so this is why the Astapori cut off all of the Unsullied's genitals, just to be sure."],"name":"Unsullied","description":"Four hundred years ago, 3,000 Unsullied saved the Free City of Qohor from destruction at the hands of Khal Temmo and his khalasar of 20,000 riders. Before the Unsullied arrived there from their long march, Temmo and his Dothraki massacred the Qohorik city guard and cavalry, while their two mercenary companies, one of them the Second Sons, broke their contract and fled. The Unsullied, however, slipped past the Dothraki while they feasted and were placed between the horde and the city. As the Dothraki have always held infantry in contempt, fit only to be ridden down, they charged instead of flanking them. Eighteen times the horselords charged and eighteen times the Unsullied locked their shields and held the line. By the end the battle only 600 Unsullied remained, but 12,000 Dothraki lay dead, including Temmo and his sons. The new Khal led the survivors past the city gates, one by one throwing their cut braids before the feet of the Unsullied. Since that day the Unsullied are employed both by cities and the rich of Essos.\n\nMagister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos keeps Unsullied as household guards at his manse, despite slavery being illegal in Pentos. A few are also present at the wedding of Khal Drogo and Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen travels from Qarth to Astapor to buy Unsullied. She is shown a group of them by Kraznys mo Nakloz, one of the Good Masters.\n\nDaenerys offers one of her dragons in exchange for 8,000 Unsullied and the boys still in training. The offer is accepted.\n\nDaenerys meets with the Good Masters in a large plaza holding the entire force of Unsullied. She delivers Drogon and is given a scourge that symbolizes ownership of the Unsullied. Now their master, she orders them to kill all the Good Masters, soldiers, and slave overseers, spare the children, and free any slaves they find. After the sacking of the city is complete, she grants them their freedom and asks if they will fight for her as free men. After a few moments, they unanimously acclaim Daenerys as their leader and join her on her march.\n\nAs the march of Daenerys' host continues, the Unsullied at Daenerys' request choose their officers, as well as their overall commander. They choose Grey Worm.  Later, they assume formation (without being asked to do so) in order to intimidate the ambassador from Yunkai.  Grey Worm later leads the infiltration team into Yunkai itself; followed by a small group of his men, they rapidly overwhelm the city.  When the freed slaves pour out of the city and approach Daenerys, the Unsullied assume defensive positions, but she orders them to stand down and goes out among the people.\n\nThe Unsullied Army marches to Meereen under the command of Queen Daenerys Targaryen. Their commander Grey Worm is caught gambling with Daario Naharis by Daenerys. As punishment, the honor of riding with Dany goes to Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy, who did not keep her waiting. The soldiers later help her to bury the bodies of 163 crucified children. The Unsullied surround Meereen's walls. They are present when Daario dispatches the city's champion. The Unsullied and the other freed slaves listen when Dany gives a speech denouncing slavery. Under her orders, they catapult broken chains across Meereen's walls.\n\nLater, Grey Worm and several Unsullied infiltrate Meereen disguised as slaves and convince the slaves to rebel against their \"Great Masters\". After seizing the city, the Unsullied carry out Dany's orders to crucify 163 of the city's Great Masters for the 163 slave children she found crucified on the way to Meereen.  Grey Worm and the other Unsullied serve as Dany's guards at the Great Pyramid. Grey Worm and other Unsullied soldiers swim in the sea outside Meereen. During that time, Grey Worm begins to develop feelings for Missandei. Barristan later watches the Unsullied taking down the crucified bodies of the Great Masters when he receives a letter from a little bird incriminating Jorah. Later, Grey Worm and several Unsullied are present when Dany exiles Jorah for being a secret spy for King Robert Baratheon.\n\nAfter having an audience with an elderly slave named Fennesz and hearing about the lawlessness at the refugee centres, Dany agrees to send her Unsullied to restore order.\n\nAs a symbolic gesture of a new era, the Unsullied pulled down the large golden harpy at the top of the Great Pyramid. One of the Unsullied, named White Rat, enters a brothel and is entertained by a prostitute. He is then murdered by a member of the Sons of the Harpy, an insurgent organization opposed to Daenerys' rule and dedicated to restoring the old ways. In response, Dany orders Grey Worm to hunt down the culprits and that White Rat be buried in the Temple of the Graces to send a message to Meereen.\n\nTogether, Grey Worm and Daario raid the house of a member of the Harpies and discover him behind a false wall. Daenerys intends to put the Harpy on trial but a former Meereenese slave named Mossador murders him. To show that she is impartial and fair, Dany executes Mossador. This sparks much outrage among the former slave population and they haggle with both their former masters and the Unsullied guarding Dany.\n\nAfter ambushing several members of the Second Sons with help of the same prostitute, the Sons of the Harpy lure Grey Worm and his Unsullied patrol into the catacombs. There, they are ambushed and many of the Unsullied are killed. Grey Worm is saved by the intervention of Barristan Selmy, who is killed by the Harpies despite killing all the remaining insurgents. Missandei tends to the wounded Grey Worm while other Unsullied round up the Grand Masters and bring them to Dany, who forces their cooperation. As a result, Dany agrees to marry Hizdahr zo Loraq in order to forge stronger ties with Meereen.\n\nAt the urging of Hizdahr, Dany agrees to reopen the fighting pits in order to appease the Meereenese. Several Unsullied accompanied her to a fighting match where the exiled Jorah defeats the other combatants. Dany is furious at encountering Jorah and orders the Unsullied to take him away. Before the Unsullied can comply, the exiled Tyrion Lannister arrives and announces himself as Jorah's \"gift.\" Unsullied guards are present in Dany's throne room when she holds an audience with Jorah and Tyrion. Unable to forgive Jorah, she exiles him but allows Tyrion to remain as her advisor.\n\nUnsullied guards are present at the gladiatorial match at the reopened Daznak's Pit. Many Unsullied are killed when the Sons of the Harpy launch an attack on the arena. However, the Unsullied fight off their attackers and protect Daenerys with the help of Jorah and Daario. In the end, the Harpies force the Unsullied and their Queen to the centre of the arena. During the fight, the Unsullied kill many of the Harpies. Shortly later, the dragon Drogon arrives and Dany flees the city on his back.\n\nHaving recovered from injuries, Grey Worm agrees to take command of the Unsullied and help Tyrion keep order in the city. Meanwhile, Jorah and Daario embark on a mission to rescue Danenerys and bring her back to Meereen.\n\nSeveral Unsullied bring the Meereenese prostitute Vala to the throne room of the Great Pyramid. There, the spymaster Varys strikes a deal with Vala. In return for sending her and her son to live in Pentos, Vala reveals that the slave-trading cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis are secretly aiding the Sons of the Harpy. Using this information, Tyrion gets Varys to use his spy network to initiate contact with the leaders of Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis. As a result, the two parties reach a compromise that slavery will be phased out over a period of seven years and that all slave owners will be compensated. As a former slave, Grey Worm thinks that the peace treaty will not work but publicly supports Tyrion.\n\nLater, the slave-trading cities break their peace treaty with Tyrion and launch a naval bombardment of Meereen. Recognizing that diplomacy has failed, Tyrion gives Grey Worm command over the city's defenses. Grey Worm proposes that his Unsullied not fight on the beaches and instead hold the pyramid. Shortly later, Daenerys returns on her dragon Drogon.\n\nThe next day, a group of Unsullied escort Daenerys and Tyrion when they parley with the leaders of the slavers' cities at the Great Pyramid. The slaving cities' representatives, Belicho Paenymion, Razdal mo Eraz, and Yezzan zo Qaggaz demand that Dany and Tyrion surrender the Unsullied and Missandei in return for being allowed to leave Meereen unharmed. Yezzan states that the Unsullied and Missandei are to be auctioned off to the highest bidder and her other two dragons are to be slaughtered. Dany corrects them, saying they are there to discuss the slavers' surrender, not hers. As they mock her, Drogon arrives and lands beside Dany. She climbs on his back and rides out to sea. Viserion and Rhaegal break free from the pyramid dungeon and join Drogon in destroying the ships attacking the city, allowing Dany to capture the remainder of the slavers' fleet. After the emissaries' bodyguards flee, Missandei announces that one of the slavers must die, and Belicho and Razdal quickly give up Yezzan. The Unsullied watch as Grey Worm, under Tyrion's orders, executes Belicho and Razdal for trying to sacrifice Yezzan. Yezzan is allowed to leave so that he can spread word of Daenerys' power.\n\nWhen Daenerys sails to Westeros with her fleet, together with the combined Greyjoy, Tyrell, and Martell armadas, some of the Unsullied are seen standing together on the deck of a ship, led by their commander Grey Worm.\n\nAfter landing at Dragonstone island, Grey Worm and several Unsullied warriors accompany Queen Daenerys, Tyrion Lannister, and Missandei as they enter Dragonstone castle. Later, Daenerys, on the advice of Tyrion, tasks Grey Worm and his Unsullied with assaulting the Lannister stronghold of Casterly Rock.\n\nUnder Grey Worm's leadership, the Unsullied try to storm the battlements of Casterly Rock. As their initial attempts are rebuffed, Grey Worm leads a team through the secret tunnel beneath the castle, which had been created by Tyrion to smuggle prostitutes. The Unsullied overcome the paltry Lannister garrison only to discover that the bulk on the Lannister forces have evacuated Casterly Rock. Euron Greyjoy's Iron Fleet then ambushes the Targaryen fleet, stranding the Unsullied. The Unsullied then travel to King's Landing to present themselves along with the rest of Daenary's forces for the parley with Queen Cersei Lannister.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Unsullied"}}

She is training with a male prostitute and receives instructions on how to act aroused by the veteran Ros.\n\nLater, a customer of the brothel watches Marei having sex with the same male prostitute through a spy-hole in the wall of one of the brothel's rooms.\n\nAlong with Kayla and Genna, she is one of the three prostitutes hired by Tyrion Lannister to service Podrick Payne as a reward for saving his life in the Battle of the Blackwater. Marei and her colleagues are apparently so satisfied with Podrick that they decline payment, much to the astonishment of Tyrion, Bronn, Ros, and even Varys.\n\nMarei is the second of three prostitutes being offered to Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand by Olyvar (the first prostitute was dismissed as too timid). Ellaria is delighted to see that Marei is \"not timid\". When Oberyn asks her if she likes women, Marei says that she does, as long as they look like Ellaria, prompting the Dornish paramour to compliment Marei's good taste. She begins kissing Ellaria, but they are interrupted when Oberyn storms out of the room to confront two Lannister soldiers.\n\nMarei later indeed services Ellaria during a private orgy also involving Oberyn, Olyvar, and a third prostitute, possibly to celebrate the recent assassination of King Joffrey Baratheon at his own wedding. Lord Tywin Lannister then interrupts, entering the room and saying he wants to discuss political matters with Prince Oberyn in private - particularly, that he wants Oberyn to be a judge at his son Tyrion's trial, and will give him a seat on the Small Council to ensure that Dorne continues to support Joffrey's younger brother Tommen. Marei and the other prostitutes quickly leave, along with Ellaria.\n\nWhen the Faith Militant is rearmed, they storm Littlefinger's brothel, driving out all of the prostitutes and clients. Marei is interrupted while in the middle of having sex with a man, and they drag her out of the brothel by her hair while she screams in terror. Olyvar tries to intervene with the man hauling her out but he simply gets hit in the face.\n\nMarei apparently managed to survive any rough treatment by the Faith Militant. Months later she is shown naked in Grand Maester Pycelle's chambers after a night of sex (much as he earlier had sex with Ros and Daisy). As he gets ready to head out for the day, she gets annoyed and asks him where her money is. He waves her aside and says he'll pay later, at which she leaves. Pycelle did not live to pay her, however, as he was subsequently assassinated by the Little birds at the order of Cersei Lannister and Qyburn.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Marei"}}

Uniting all of the wildlings is only possible with a very intelligent leader of impressive military skill and personal charisma. Most of the time, the wildlings are nowhere near united.","According to Jon Snow, there have been six major attempted wildling invasions into the South over the past one thousand years, and all six were ultimately defeated. Presumably each was led by a King-Beyond-the-Wall, though it is unclear if there were other Kings-Beyond-the-Wall who didn't invade in the past millennium. There have been many other Kings-Beyond-the-Wall in the seven thousand years before that, stretching back to the construction of the Wall about eight thousand years ago.","Gendel was actually joint king with his brother Gorne. They lived three thousand years ago (after the Andal Invasion of the south, which was six thousand years ago). The brothers and their army bypassed the Wall by digging an extensive tunnel network underneath it. Eventually their invasion was stopped by the Stark King in the North, and Gendel slain. Gorne retreated back to the tunnels with his surviving followers, never to be seen again. It is suspected that they didn't know the tunnels as well as Gendel did, or that there was a cave in. The Night's Watch destroyed the entrances on the southern side but never explored all of the tunnels.

They reject the notion, which is rendered moot when Robb Stark and Theon Greyjoy arrive. Osha later tells Maester Luwin that they were fleeing the awakening of an old, remorseless foe, the White Walkers, indicating that the wildlings are already aware of the threat of the Walkers and may already be fighting them.\n\nLord Commander Jeor Mormont, puzzled by reports of Mance Rayder's forces gathering in the mountains, decides to lead a reconnaissance-in-force to determine Rayder's intentions and level of threat.\n\nMormont sends a letter to King's Landing, requesting additional men to help hold the Wall against the threat of the wildlings while he moves against Mance Rayder. Varys suggests that the wildlings may indeed be more dangerous than in the past, due to their uniting under Mance Rayder. However, both Petyr Baelish and Cersei Lannister are dismissive of the threat, pointing out they cannot spare men from their own war against the Starks. Tyrion, recalling his brief time at the Wall, is less certain that the problem can be ignored.\n\nAccording to Ygritte, thousands of Wildlings are gathering in the Frostfang mountains under the command of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder, forming the biggest Wildling host in living memory. Ygritte points out to Jon Snow that the Free Folk follow Mance Rayder because they chose him to be King-Beyond-the-Wall, not like people south of the Wall who serve kings and lords because they are the son of the last ruler. She also says that Rayder used to be a member of the Night's Watch, but fled because he wished to be free, just like the other wildlings.\n\nAfter Jon Snow kills Qhorin Halfhand, the wildlings choose to let Mance decide Jon's fate.

Reginald suggests that the Starks have stretched their lines too thin and will struggle to sustain their army with winter imminent. Tywin rejects this notion, saying that the Starks are more capable than they are of coping with cold. The council continues and Tywin chastises his bannermen for waiting for Robb Stark to fail and that he won't unless they make him. He asks how they will stop Robb and Reginald ignores the question to say that they have been working through the night and would benefit from sleep. Tywin says that he believes Reginald would and that because they are cousins he might let Reginald wake from his sleep. He orders Reginald to return to his wife in Lannisport before he decides to send her his head. He adds that Reginald is only an officer because of his birth and otherwise would be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Reginald_Lannister"}}

He has Walda announce the news that she is pregnant, and that from the way she is carrying, Maester Wolkan expects it is a boy. Ramsay is visibly distressed by the news, and expresses his distress after dinner. Though Roose dismisses his concern about his position, he subtly warns Ramsay that he better behave himself if he wants to keep it.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Winterfell, Sansa escapes from the castle with the aid of her childhood friend, Theon Greyjoy, whom Ramsay had previously captured and tortured into accepting a new identity as \"Reek\". Despite their victory over Stannis Baratheon, Roose is disappointed in Ramsay for allowing Sansa to escape, and states that if he is unable to produce an heir, that responsibility may pass to his son by Walda.\n\nAfter the squad that Ramsay sends after them is wiped out due to the intervention of Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne, Roose expresses his disappointment once again, and is angered by Ramsay's suggestion that they should attack Castle Black to retreive Sansa and kill her half-brother Jon Snow, the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. It is then that Maester Wolkan announces Walda has given birth to a healthy baby boy. When Ramsay goes to embrace Roose in congratulations, he suddenly stabs his father in the chest, killing him, and commands the Maester to bring Lady Walda and the baby to him in the courtyard.\n\nWalda arrives to meet with \"Lord Bolton\", where Ramsay receives her, taking his newborn brother in his arms momentarily, before handing him back over to his mother. He then guides her into the kennels, where he says Lord Bolton is waiting for her, and locks the gate behind them, before proceeding to open the cages of his hounds one by one. Walda soon realizes what is happening, and demands to see Lord Bolton, at which point Ramsay announces; \"I am Lord Bolton\". Realizing her husband is dead, Walda begs to be allowed to leave and return to her grandfather in the The Riverlands, promising she will never return to Winterfell again, and reminds Ramsay that what he is about to do, he's about to do to his own brother. Ramsay replies that he prefers to be an only child, and sets the hounds on Walda and the baby, who tear them apart.\n\nBoth Walda and her baby are later avenged when Jon Snow retakes Winterfell and has Ramsay fed to the hounds.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bolton_(son_of_Roose)"}}

Wun Wun appears willing to support Tormund casting his vote simply by stating Tormund's name. Later, when the Night's Watch is gathering the dragonglass that Jon shared with the free folk, as it can kill the White Walkers, Wun Wun is holding a dragonglass arrowhead, and Eddison Tollett approaches to tell the giant to give it up, though he is too afraid to do so because of his intimidating size. Wun Wun gets annoyed by his inaction and asks \"The fuck you looking at?\" in the giants' rudimentary form of the Old Tongue, so Edd goes away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead, Wun Wun may still possess this piece of dragonglass. When the Wights attack the village, Wun Wun single-handedly defeats about a dozen of them by ripping them apart, stomping on them, and defending himself with a large burning log. He then retreats into the sea with Jon and the remaining defenders. Being too large for the rowboats, he simply wades out into the bay for a long distance (not drowning due to his great height) to reach the larger ships waiting off shore. He is among the few free folk to escape the Massacre at Hardhome, and the fleet travels back to the Wall.\n\nAlongside the other wildlings, he passes the Wall and leaves Castle Black to settle in the Gift. Many brothers of the Night's Watch are intimidated by him, having never seen a giant before.\n\nWun Wun and Tormund lead the free folk in an attack on Castle Black, this time to save Jon's body and his few loyalists from the mutineers. Wun Wun breaks down the gates and intimidates the brothers into quickly surrendering, only killing one black brother after he foolishly (and futilely) shoots the giant in the back with a crossbow. After Tormund orders the brothers to stand down, Wun Wun witnesses Ser Alliser and Olly being taken into custody for their role in the mutiny and the murder of Jon Snow.\n\nWhen Jon, Sansa and Tormund attempt to recruit the wildlings, Wun Wun is present and is the first to cast his vote by saying 'Snow'.\n\nWun Wun is on the front lines of Jon's army fighting against Ramsay Bolton and his forces at Winterfell. During the battle, after Jon's cavalry enters the fight and Ramsay's archers stop, Davos leads Wun Wun and his archers in a charge, as they cannot fire from their current position without hitting their own men. Wun Wun fights until they are surrounded by Smalljon Umber and the Bolton army. Wun Wun uses his colossal strength to try and tear through the infantry line, but despite making a few noteworthy kills, he is outmatched by the rows of enemy pikes. He appears significantly weakened by his injuries. However, Petyr Baelish arrives with the Knights of the Vale, his aid having been finally accepted by Sansa.\n\nRamsay's forces are decimated by the Vale cavalry and he retreats to Winterfell, reassuring his men that the opposing army lacks the resources to lay siege. Moments later, being in the vanguard to reach Winterfell, Wun Wun uses the last of his strength to breach the fortress's wooden doors with his bare hands, and then is riddled with arrows by the few remaining Bolton archers. At that point, the Starks and Arryns reach Winterfell and proceed to clear out the remaining Boltons. Wun Wun falls to his knees, bloodied, injured and exhausted from the battle, as yet more bolts and arrows are fired into him. As he looks at Jon, who reaches out to him, he is shot in the eye by Ramsay Bolton, killing him, as Jon and Tormund watch helplessly. Enraged, Jon furiously beats Ramsay to a pulp but stops after noticing Sansa standing over them. Wun Wun is avenged when Ramsay is taken prisoner, and after a barbed exchange with Sansa, he is fed to his own starving hounds.\n\nIt is currently unknown if Wun Wun was the last of his kind, or if giants still exist somewhere beyond the Wall. In the opening episode of Season 7, Dragonstone, a horde of wights led by White Walkers, includes a few giants who have been converted to wights.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Wun_Weg_Wun_Dar_Wun"}}

Years ago, Roose discovered that a miller had wed without his permission. He had the miller hanged and raped his wife. Ramsay was born shortly afterwards, and his mother brought him to the Dreadfort, his father's castle, for Roose to acknowledge as his son. Roose very nearly killed both Ramsay and his mother, but relented upon realizing that the child was indeed his.","After Winterfell is seized by Theon Greyjoy for the ironborn, Ramsay is dispatched by his father Roose Bolton to re-take it in the name of King Robb Stark. Ramsay's forces besiege the castle and he infuriates Theon by blowing a horn all through the night. The following morning, Theon rallies his men to defend the castle, but he is betrayed and knocked out cold by his men, who accept Robb Stark's offer of mercy for the ironborn garrison if they surrender and hand over Theon. However, the castle is sacked by Ramsay afterwards and instead of letting the ironborn walk free, he flays them alive.","Ramsay admits that the rumors about Theon were true, and that he did have a \"good-sized cock\", motioning towards Theon's blood-stained, badly-sewn up britches before momentarily tricking him into believing that the pork sausage he is eating is his penis. Ramsay talks about amputees having phantom limbs and wonders if Theon will have a phantom penis, feeling an itch whenever he sees naked girls. When Theon begs to be killed, Ramsay states that he is no good to him dead. Ramsay decides to give Theon a new name, and beats him until he starts calling himself \"Reek\". Ramsay also sends a letter to Balon Greyjoy with a box containing Theon's penis. He threatens to send more of Theon's body parts and flay every ironborn in the North alive if they have not left by the full moon.","Upon arrival Ramsay and his men are either forced to wait outside the fort's gates, or invited directly into the Great Hall at the discretion of Ethan Forrester, the house's new lord. Once inside, Ramsay wastes no time in asserting his authority over the young lordling, demanding that Ethan bend the knee to him, and swear fealty to House Bolton. Ethan may or may not have complied, and Ramsay will either congratulate him on his good sense, or bristle at the refusal before turning his attention to the ironwood. Ramsay hammers out a new contact with the Forresters, in which they agree to continue supplying House Bolton with ironwood, just as they did the Starks for centuries, albeit with major concessions. In addition to relinquishing half of their ironwood holdings to the Whitehills, Ramsay announces his intentions to install a Whitehill garrison within the walls of Ironrath, a prospect which horrifies the Forresters. Ramsay also demands a hostage to ensure the Forrester's future loyalty.","Ramsay besieges Moat Cailin and sends Reek to treat with the ironborn garrison, posing as Theon Greyjoy. Theon vouches for Ramsay's promise of safe passage back to the Iron Islands if they surrender. The ironborn surrender, and Ramsay instead flays them all alive. Having taken Moat Cailin, Ramsay and his father meet on an open field. Roose hands him a document legitimizing his bastard son and granting him the right to call himself \"Bolton\". Ramsay is delighted, and they then make their way towards Winterfell.","Ramsay takes his men into Stannis's camp and they torch some of his tents, severely depleting Stannis's men and resources, and manage to flee back to Winterfell without being spotted.","Harald Karstark later arrives at Winterfell to notify Ramsay and Roose that Theon and Sansa have disappeared. Ramsay suggests that they march on the Wall, kill Jon and retrieve Sansa, a suggestion Roose immediately dismisses on the basis that Jon is a bastard. Roose argues against Ramsay's plan on the grounds that killing the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch would only further alienate the rest of the Northern houses, many of which are still angry with the Boltons for their part in the Red Wedding. Maester Wolkan announces that Walda has given birth to a baby boy. Roose calms him by promising him that he will always be his firstborn, but Ramsay stabs his father in the chest, killing him instantly. Ramsay orders Wolkan to announce that Roose was poisoned by their enemies, and to bring Walda and the baby to him. After glimpsing his new half-brother in the Winterfell courtyard, Ramsay leads Walda to the kennels and locks them inside, setting the hounds to maul them to death.","To Sansa's surprise, Bran is able to recount Sansa's wedding night with Ramsay, much to her distress.","In the trailer for the fourth season, while shooting the sex scene between Ramsay and Myranda, Myranda is shown striking Ramsay as well as strangling him, but the striking was cut, and in a \"Behind the scenes\" video of the sixth season, Jon is shown double-axe-handling Ramsay as well as punching him, which was also cut.","In the books, Ramsay is known for his ostentatious taste in clothes; garbing himself in velvet, silk, and satin, usually in the Bolton colors\u2014pink and red. In the show, however, Ramsay's attire is considerably more subdued, in order to fit in with the established drab dress code for northern characters. That being said, the leather jerkin Ramsay wears in season four is, in fact, a very dark shade of reddish purple: a subtle reference to his literary counterpart."],"name":"Ramsay Bolton","description":"Ramsay is a genuine sociopath. He is sadistic, wild, and completely capable of committing unspeakable atrocities without remorse, simply for pure amusement. Ramsay fully admits\u2014and indeed revels in the fact\u2014that he tortures and kills innocent people for no reason whatsoever, and that they did not deserve what he did to them. It simply made him feel powerful.\n\nWhenever he has the advantage in a skirmish, Ramsay is fearless\u2014almost a beast in human skin\u2014reveling in the violence of personal combat. This is the polar opposite of Joffrey Baratheon's cowardice. Ramsay did not rave and rage, however, he had a perverse, playful, childlike giddiness as he inflicts pain on others, from flaying men alive to hunting and killing girls for sport. This behavior, however, was not displayed when Jon Snow proposes that the two of them fight one-on-one rather than send thousands to their deaths to determine who holds sway over The North, Ramsay scoffs at the idea due to his initial numerical superiority, and also strikes anger in Jon and Sansa's hearts by having Smalljon Umber drop Shaggydog's head in front of them to display his power over them mentally and physically. Only when Jon and his allies breach Winterfell thanks to the arrival of the knights of the Vale, does Ramsay reconsider fighting one-on-one against him, choosing a bow and arrows as his weapon but only because he knew he would be quickly killed if he chose to attack the surrounding soldiers whereas he had a better chance of surviving but fighting Jon one-on-one.\n\nIn his own twisted way Ramsay was actually quite intelligent, possessing a certain \"low cunning\" with which he tricked his enemies. He was particularly good at thinking on his feet, but reckless when it came to long-term consequences and intricate politics. Ramsay deeply enjoyed playing mind games with his enemies using psychological torture, often tricking them into trusting him only to then break his empty promises. A good display of Ramsay's deceitful tact was when while playing a \"game\" with Theon Greyjoy to guess where he was, who he was, and why he was being tortured, he allowed him to believe his guesses were correct until he pointed out that Theon \"forgot to ask if he was a liar\" and continued to flay his finger anyway. Another instance is using Rickon Stark as bait to \"trap\" Jon in the middle of the battlefield at the Battle of the Bastards, knowing that his family-loving nature would leave him defenseless to arrow attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, Ramsay is very impulsive, not fully considering the long-term consequences of his actions much to his father's chagrin. When Lord Medger Cerwyn refuses to pay Ramsay taxes or even acknowledge Bolton rule, Ramsay flays Cerwyn alive along with his wife and brother while forcing his son to watch, and puts the corpses on public display. Roose angrily warns his son that this disproportionate brutality is severely damaging their long-term position but Ramsay largely ignores his warnings, instead privately holding a massive feast for himself even as other lords are worried about stockpiling provisions for the winter.\n\nRamsay is greatly frustrated by his bastard status, and was easily angered when he was referred to in such a way. A possible source of this resentment was his jealousy of Jon Snow, another Northern bastard son who was raised by his father, Ned Stark, alongside his trueborn sons and eventually rose to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and as such, Ramsay desired to rise to a powerful political position as Jon did, which he himself states to Sansa by comparing himself to Jon. Ramsay's jealousy of Jon was so much that he expressed a willingness to kill Jon if the chance comes, though at the same time appears fearful when he hears that Jon may come after him with a wildling army. Due to his immense insecurities about his baseborn status, Ramsay makes it a point to mock and belittle Jon for being a bastard\u2014continuously referring to him as \"bastard\" in both a letter he sends to him at Castle Black, and in person when they finally meet, despite the fact that Ramsay is initially a bastard himself.\n\nDue to having played mind games and tortured helpless and defenseless victims and getting away with it all his life, Ramsay is not used to the possibility of losing a confrontation. Even while being beaten almost to death by Jon, Ramsay smiles with confidence that somehow he will survive, and even displays this behavior when faced with his hungry hounds, who he staunchly believes will never harm him. However, when one of the dogs disobeys his commands to get off him and starts hungrily licking his face, Ramsay's commands get more desperate, and for the first and last time in his life, Ramsay shows genuine fear when he realizes he can't control them and may actually not survive after all.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ramsay_Bolton"}}

Also, despite her vicious and sadistic nature, Wolkan appears saddened at Myranda's death and even more so when Ramsay instructs him to feed Myranda's body to the dogs instead of cremating or burying her with dignity, even though Myranda had no dignity to speak of in the first place. This appears to be due to Wolkan's training as a maester, to generally help people instead of harming them in contrast to the likes of Myranda, Locke and the Master Torturer. With Ramsay now gone, however, Wolkan appears much more comfortable serving Jon Snow and House Stark.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Wolkan"}}

One of the stories narrates how he stole gold from the sun to brighten his hair.\n\nThere are many different and contradictory myths about Lann the Clever, assuming he actually existed, which only share the basic description that he swindled Casterly Rock from House Casterly \"using only his wits\" - though there are even rival tales about what specifically winning it \"by his wits\" involved. Some stories say that he found a secret tunnel into Casterly Rock, and snuck around inside causing intrigue between the Casterlys, stealing treasures from one brother's chamber and planting them in another's to cause strife, until ultimately the Casterlys killed each other and Lann took over, and possibly finished off any survivors. Other tales say that he used the secret tunnel to infest the castle with rats and vermin, until the Casterlys fled - while yet other tales say that he managed to sneak lions into the castle, who killed several Casterlys and caused the rest to flee. The more pragmatic story is that Lann was simply a man-at-arms in the castle, who impregnated Lord Casterly's daughter, and ended up marrying the girl. Because there were no other heirs left, when Lord Casterly died Lann became the new Lord of the Rock through his child. This story also has several variants, as in some there simply was no other heir, while in others Lann had married a low-ranking daughter and had to \"use his wits\" in various palace intrigues to increase his power and eliminate rival heirs who were further ahead in the line of succession.\n\nEven Lann's origins are not clear in the legends. Some say that he was actually an Andal adventurer who came to the far west, though others dismiss this because the main Andal invasion didn't occur until thousands of years later. Then again, it is not outright impossible that he was simply an Andal adventurer (or perhaps exile) who wandered all the way to the far side of Westeros. Even so, most versions of the story do assume that he was simply one of the First Men, the only human settlers of Westeros at the time. Whatever the case, the rulers of Casterly Rock eventually married into invading Andal families and the \"modern\" House Lannister came to be.\n\nOn one other point the tales all agree: Lann never called himself a \"king\". The Casterlys were very rich but they had not called themselves \"kings\" either, and Lann didn't crown himself when he took over Casterly Rock. The Lannisters only started calling themselves \"kings\" many generations later, after their steadily accumulating wealth made them very powerful (though still long before the Andal invasion).\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lann"}}

Their leader killed, the Targaryen army collapsed, and the rebels were victorious.","When Daenerys successfully consumes a stallion's heart and the Dosh khaleen declare her unborn son to be the Stallion Who Mounts the World, Daenerys confirms this, and declares that he will be named Rhaego in honor of her brother.","When Daenerys Targaryen considers the possibility of buying Unsullied to employ as her army in her quest to win the Iron Throne, Ser Barristan Selmy pleads her not to do it. He recounts how, as a Kingsguard, he knew Rhaegar and fought beside him at the Battle of the Trident, and that day men fought and died for Rhaegar because they believed in him and loved him. Ser Jorah Mormont counters that Rhaegar fought bravely and honorably, but perished nonetheless. Daenerys asks Barristan if he knew Rhaegar well: he responds that he did, and Rhaegar was the finest man he ever knew - the last dragon. Daenerys is saddened, as Rhaegar died before she was born, and says she wishes she had known him - but he was not the last dragon (she is).","While conversing with Tyrion Lannister shortly after his arrival to King's Landing for the upcoming wedding of Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, Prince Oberyn Martell, Elia's younger brother, shows his ire toward Rhaegar for leaving his sister (after she bore his children, and despite her love and loyalty to him) \"for another woman\" (Lyanna Stark).","Barristan Selmy shares some of his memories of Rhaegar with his sister Daenerys in Meereen. She is pleasantly surprised to discover that Rhaegar was more than the great killer that Viserys made him out to be. Selmy tells her how Rhaegar used to disguise himself as a minstrel and play on the streets of King's Landing while Ser Barristan stood guard. Rhaegar made quite a tidy profit on these excursions, and although he once spent the money on getting himself and Selmy very, very drunk, he usually gave the money away to other minstrels or to orphanages. Barristan mentions that Rhaegar never liked killing but instead loved singing.","Through a series of visions, Bran Stark, Lyanna's nephew, witnesses the showdown that took place at the Tower of Joy, and learns that his \"half-brother\", Jon Snow, is actually Rhaegar's son by Bran's aunt Lyanna, and that his father, Eddard, passed him off as his bastard son in order to protect him from Robert, who would have surely killed him if he ever found out. Before his death at the climax of the showdown, Ser Arthur told Eddard that Rhaegar had ordered them to remain at the Tower of Joy, but he did not specify why.","Samwell and Gilly subsequently leave Oldtown, and later arrive in Winterfell. Sam meets with Bran Stark, who informs Sam that he has learned from his visions that Jon isn't really Eddard Stark's son, but the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Bran thinks his real name shouldn't even be \"Snow\" but \"Sand\", the special surname used for bastards born in Dorne. This makes Samwell, however, realize the significance of the High Septon's diary entry about Rhaegar's secret second marriage, and he asks the skeptical Bran if he can use his powers to check what really happened. Using his Greensight, Bran looks back through time again to see the secret wedding of Rhaegar and Lyanna in front of a Weirwood Heart tree. With joy in her eyes, Lyanna lovingly kisses Rhaegar. Stunned, Bran explains to Sam that Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie: Rhaegar didn't kidnap and rape Lyanna, she loved him. Their secret marriage also means that Jon Snow is in fact Rhaegar's lawful son, and the real rightful heir to the Iron Throne (ahead of Rhaegar's younger sister Daenerys). Bran then finally recalls Jon's birth name, whispered to Ned Stark with Lyanna's dying breath: \"Aegon Targaryen\" (apparently named after his half-brother, who died shortly before he was born).","* Bran's flashback vision","King Aerys's madness worsened with every passing year, compounded by the stress from a series of dead children with Queen Rhaella after Rhaegar but before Viserys: three miscarriages, two stillbirths, and three other infant sons who died in the cradle. Aerys also had many mistresses, and he lusted after Tywin's wife Joanna Lannister. Nonetheless, Aerys started hypocritically blaming his wife for their dead children, accusing that such weak pregnancies must have been fathered by some other, lesser man. In time Aerys became physically abusive to Rhaegar's mother, and from her screams it was an open secret in the Red Keep that he raped her on several occasions. All of this added to Rhaegar's grief and inner turmoil.","Confirmation of exactly what happened between Rhaegar and Lyanna will have to await the release of the future novels."],"name":"Rhaegar Targaryen","description":"Rhaegar was a wise, kind, and well-educated man, greatly loved in the Seven Kingdoms before his alleged abduction of Lyanna Stark. He was everything that could be hoped for in a future king, and very popular with lords and commoners alike - in contrast to his increasingly erratic father. Aerys's descent into insanity and paranoia greatly troubled Rhaegar, which led to him often brooding on his inner turmoils. Rhaegar's honor and intelligence made him very charismatic, earning him the honest support of his followers. Neither Rhaegar's allies nor his enemies could ever explain in later years why such a promising young prince would suddenly abduct Lyanna Stark, as it didn't seem in his character.\n\nDespite the superb skills he displayed while participating in the great Tourney at Harrenhal, Ser Barristan Selmy (whom Rhaegar had unhorsed in the final joust) described Rhaegar as a peaceful man who much preferred singing over fighting and killing. He was highly skilled at playing the harp as well, and would often go out into the streets of the capital city disguised as a common minstrel to play and sing for passers-by.\n\nRhaegar's sorrow at the behavior of his father (and his treatment of Queen Rhaella) gave him compassion for the suffering of others. When he went out to sing in Flea Bottom, he would usually give away any money he had earned from it - sometimes to the next minstrel on the street, or to an orphanage (one time he used it to get very drunk with Barristan, though that might also be an example of him treating his friends well).\n\nAfter the Baratheons overthrew the Targaryens in Robert's Rebellion, history became biased in favor of the victors: Rhaegar became remembered as a villain second only to his insane father the Mad King, who brutally abducted and raped Lyanna Stark and left her for dead. Even the Martells, who weren't sure what happened with Lyanna and didn't specifically care, were still upset that in either scenario, Rhaegar left Elia Martell for another woman (albeit theirs was an arranged marriage and not for love, this is actually the norm for nobles in Westeros). Had the Lannisters not butchered Elia Martell and her children by Rhaegar, the Martells might have kept that view, but the Lannisters' needless brutality drove a wedge between Dorne and the new Lannister-funded Baratheon regime in King's Landing. Targaryen loyalists, meanwhile - such as Rhaegar's own younger brother Viserys, in exile - developed their own skewed remembrance of events, that Rhaegar was the perfect Crown Prince, a tragic figure, and Robert was the villain of their story.\n\nUltimately, Rhaegar still remains a controversial and perplexing figure - his star-crossed romance with Lyanna Stark inadvertently led to his insane father sparking a war with half of the Seven Kingdoms. Thousands died due to Rhaegar's actions (or inaction), ending in his death, the overthrow and exile of what was left of his family, and (indirectly) resulted in the murder of Elia and their two children together. What could possibly have motivated Rhaegar to not only elope with Lyanna, but fight a war to keep their marriage a secret, remains unknown. Rhaegar valued his forthcoming child with Lyanna so much that he even left champions of his Kingsguard behind in Dorne to defend her - living legends who could have tipped the balance if they had fought by his side at the Battle of the Trident.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rhaegar_Targaryen"}}

A colloquial title also used for the rulers of the North was the \"Kings of Winter\". House Stark ruled as Kings in the North for thousands of years."],"name":"King in the North","description":"House Stark ruled as Kings in the North stretching back into the mists of time, before written history began six thousand years ago, when the Andals invaded all of southern Westeros. When the Andals arrived, the Stark Kings in the North were already ruling at Winterfell. According to legend, the first King in the North was Brandon Stark, better known as Bran the Builder, who lived eight thousand years ago. According to the legends, he led the forces of the North in the War for the Dawn against the White Walkers and built the Wall to guard against their return, and also began construction of Winterfell. The Kings in the North were successfully able to fend off the Andals from invading, holding the line of the Neck at the choke point of Moat Cailin. As a result, the North remained the only independent kingdom of the First Men, with little or no ethnic imprint by the Andals. This also meant that the Faith of the Seven practiced by the Andals gained little foothold in the North, where the Kings of Winter continued their worship of the Old Gods of the Forest.\n\nAlthough all the kings of Westeros sent men to join the Night's Watch, the Kings in the North, due to their proximity to the Wall, had the duty of policing the Watch when needed. In this capacity they executed deserters, intervened in disputes amongst commanders, and even on some occasions dealt with threats that somehow slipped past the Wall.\n\nDuring the War of Conquest, by the time King Torrhen Stark gathered his armies to challenge the invaders, Aegon the Conqueror had already won the decisive Field of Fire and conquered most of southern Westeros. Seeing that the war was already lost and that the Northern armies had no hope of driving back Aegon's armies or his dragons, Torrhen wisely chose to spare his people by bending the knee, although it earned him the derisive nickname \"the king who knelt\". In return for Torrhen's submission, Aegon allowed House Stark to continue ruling the North as they had for thousands of years, but as vassals of the Iron Throne. They held the titles of Lord Paramount of the North, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. The Starks thus retained their ancient positions and traditions, including their duties policing the Night's Watch.\n\nThree centuries later, House Stark was amongst the rebel Houses during Robert's Rebellion, in which the Targaryen dynasty was deposed and Robert crowned as the new king. The Starks were actually the primary wounded party of the events leading up to the rebellion: Lyanna Stark was allegedly kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen, while her father Rickard and brother Brandon were brutally murdered on trumped-up charges of treason by King Aerys.\n\nAfter the war, House Stark continued to faithfully serve the crown, as King Robert of House Baratheon was one of their closest friends, although they rarely attended court in King's Landing.\n\nDuring the opening stages of the War of the Five Kings, Lord Robb Stark was proclaimed as the new King in the North by his bannermen, the first in 300 years. Outraged by the imprisonment and then wanton execution of Robb's father Eddard Stark by Robert's successor Joffrey Baratheon, the noble lords of the North openly rebelled against the Iron Throne. Joffrey had brashly intended to shock the North into submission by executing Ned Stark, but instead this drove the Northern lords to deciding that they would never submit to Joffrey, no matter the odds against them. At a council of Robb's bannermen, some were undecided about whether they should support the rival claims to the throne by Robert's younger brothers, Stannis Baratheon or even Renly Baratheon.\n\nGreatjon Umber, who was tired of being ruled by southern lords thousands of miles away, pointed out that it was the Dragon-Kings of House Targaryen that the North had submitted to, but now they were dead. Robert Baratheon had been their ally, but now he was dead, and his younger brothers meant nothing to him (and as was soon after revealed, Joffrey wasn't even Robert's actual son but a bastard with no claim to being a Baratheon). Lord Umber declared that there was only one king he would ever serve, the King in the North. Rickard Karstark, Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover and Jonos Bracken, a local river lord, were among those who swore fealty to Robb, as did Theon Greyjoy. The call was then taken up by all of Robb's bannermen, chanting \"the King in the North!\" Soon after being declared King in the North by acclamation of his bannermen, King Robb sent a formal declaration of independence to Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, proclaiming that \"from this time until the end of time we are a free and independent kingdom\".\n\nRobb was declared King by not just the northern lords, but also several of the lords of the Riverlands, as the Starks had come to relieve the Riverlands from an invasion by the Lannisters. Also, Robb's mother is Catelyn Tully, daughter of Hoster Tully, the lord of Riverrun, and thus Robb is by rights a blood relation of House Tully, the Lords Paramount of the Riverlands. Therefore, King Robb's claimed kingdom includes both the North and the Riverlands. In practice, however, during the course of the War of the Five Kings, Robb's forces only maintain firm control of the Riverlands north of the Trident River, particularly around the regional capital of Riverrun. All of the Riverlands south of this, between the Red Fork of the Trident and Gods Eye lake, are a warzone between Lannister and Stark forces.\n\nThe \"Kingdom of the North\" came to a temporary end after the Red Wedding when Roose Bolton, who conspired with House Frey and House Lannister, initiated a massacre of the northern army and personally stabbed Robb Stark through the heart. After that, he became the new Warden of the North as a reward by Tywin Lannister.\n\nHowever, the \"Kingdom of the North\" was reestablished after a short few years under Bolton rule, when the Starks led by Jon Snow and Sansa Stark later gathered an army of Northern Houses still loyal to House Stark and retook Winterfell back from the Boltons. With the Boltons defeated, Jon Snow was proclaimed the new King in the North, re-asserting the North's independence from the Iron Throne, this time allied with the Vale of Arryn - whose Lord Paramount, Robin Arryn, is also a grandson of Hoster Tully - instead of the Riverlands, which had recently fallen to the Lannisters and Freys due to their victory at the Second Siege of Riverrun. However, Walder Frey and all of his sons were secretly murdered shortly afterward by Arya Stark in retaliation for their roles in the Red Wedding, severely weakening the Freys' hold on the Riverlands.\n\nIn order to gain her full support in the Great War, Jon bent the knee to Queen Daenerys Targaryen, renouncing his title as King and reintegrating the North and the Vale into the Seven Kingdoms once they defeat the White Walkers and House Targaryen ascends the Iron Throne. However, Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly, with the help of Gilly, have discovered that \"Jon\" is in fact the legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, and him being the son of Rhaegar puts him ahead of Daenerys in the line of succession to the Iron Throne.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the monarchs of the Stark proto-kingdom centered around Winterfell itself called themselves the \"Kings of Winter\", back when the North was divided into over a dozen petty kingdoms. Gradually the Kings of Winter extended their hegemony over these other petty kingdoms, eliminating them or absorbing them through marriage, and uniting them from time to time in alliance to throw back wildling invasions, etc. Their greatest rivals were the Red Kings of House Bolton, whose kingdom was centered around the Dreadfort on the eastern shore. The Starks finally subdued the Boltons and unified the North just around the time that the Andal Invasion began, about 6,000 years ago. As a sign of their new control over the entire region, around this time they gradually shifted from calling themselves \"Kings of Winter\" to calling themselves \"Kings in the North\" (the phrasing is always \"King in the North\", never \"King of the North\").\n\nAccording to myth, the first King of Winter was Bran the Builder, the great lord who built Winterfell and the Wall and founded the Night's Watch, following the defeat of the White Walkers in the War for the Dawn. The King in the North held all the lands of the North south to the Neck, where the ancient fortress of Moat Cailin threw back every attempt by the southern kingdoms and, later, the Andals to invade.\n\nBefore Robb, the last King in the North was Torrhen Stark. During the invasion of Aegon the Conqueror, Torrhen led a great host to the banks of the Red Fork of the River Trident, meaning to give battle, but after hearing tales of the Field of Fire and upon seeing the size of Aegon's host and the presence of his dragons, Torrhen realized his cause was hopeless. Instead, he knelt and swore fealty to Aegon. Aegon acknowledged him and House Stark as the rulers of the North in the name of the Iron Throne.\n\nMany kings are mentioned in the final chapter of A Clash of Kings: Edwyn the Spring King, Brandon the Burner, Brandon the Shipwright, Benjen the Bitter, Benjen the Sweet, and King Theon Stark, among others.\n\nThey had a crown that was lost to Aegon the Conqueror. In A Clash of Kings, Robb Stark has a new one made, matching the old one to a very precise description: an open circlet of bronze with no gemstones, topped by a row of nine black iron spikes shaped like longswords. The crown was made of only simple iron and bronze because they are the metals of war.\n\nJon Snow was not proclaimed or crowned King in the North and although he is Robb's chosen successor, he remains unaware of this position and, furthermore, his fate is uncertain, though both his resurrection and coronation in the TV series might take place in the future novels at some point.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/King_in_the_North"}}

She had been married to Gregor for many years when Robert's Rebellion signaled her family's demise; yet she nonetheless felt conflicted between her father's loyalties and her husband's. In time, Elissa came to feel that Ironrath, and she embraced her role as the Forrester matriarch. She silently sworn that she'll never see her family destroyed again.\n\nThey had several children together: Rodrik, Asher and Mira. During her fourth pregnancy, she dreamed she would birth a daughter with a voice like summer rain. But as destiny would have it, she gave birth to a boy. The infant, Ethan, wailed for hours - until Lady Elissa entered a second labor, this time birthing a girl. She named the girl Talia, after her own mother, and from then on Ethan never cried again. She gave birth to one more son a few years later, Ryon.\n\nHer son, Asher, later went into self-exile in Essos to stop a war being started over his love for Gwyn Whitehill. Lady Elissa wanted her eldest daughter - Mira - to learn the ways of a southern court, so arranged for her to serve as a handmaiden for Margaery Tyrell.\n\nGared Tuttle, Gregor's squire returns from The Twins, bearing news that Gregor and Rodrik have been slain in the Red Wedding. He returns Gregor's Greatsword. Her son, Ethan is made the new Lord of Ironrath and Elissa attends his council meetings, giving him advice and helping to keep Ser Royland Degore and Duncan Tuttle from bickering.\n\nThey soon encounter problems from House Whitehill, who desire their Ironwood forests.Lord Whitehill had been a childhood friend of Roose Bolton and plans to take all of House Forresters Ironwood, robbing them of their greatest asset. Lord Whitehill is received by Ethan in the Great Hall and quickly begins antagonizing the young boy. Lady Elissa arrives and reminds him to show her son some respect as they are in his home.\n\nShe writes to her daughter, Mira, in King's Landing asking her to try and convince Lady Margaery to use her influence in court to convince King Joffrey to let House Forrester keep their Ironwood forests, overruling whatever House Bolton would decide, as Lord Whitehill planned to go to them, as House Forrester's new liege lords, so they could relinquish House Forrester's rights to the Ironwood forests and hand them over to House Whitehill.\n\nBehind her son's back she arranges for her brother, Malcolm, to sail to Essos to find Asher and bring him back. She claims Asher has no interest in becoming lord, but could lead men in battle should a war begin between the Forresters and the Whitehills. Ethan can either agree with this plan or refuse it.\n\nWhen Ramsay Snow arrives with Lord Whitehill to discuss distributing control over the Ironwood forests, Elissa is present alongside Talia and Ryon. Ramsay takes glee in first taunting Ryon and then seems keen to take Talia on \"a hunt\". Due to Ethan's response to this, Ramsay stabs him in the throat. Elissa runs to her son's side and he bleeds out as she cradles his body. She calls out for her son as Lord Whitehill drags Ryon away as his captive.\n\nShe is informed that Rodrik was found alive and rolled in on a corpse cart alongside the dead body of her husband, Gregor. She visits Rodrik as Maester Ortengryn works on healing him, but Rodrik passes out shortly after she arrives.\n\nWhile Rodrik is passed out, Elissa tells Talia to write a song for Ethan and Gregor, to sing at their upcoming funeral. Elissa then quickly sends a letter to Mira in King's Landing, asking for help in ensuring Elaena Glenmore and Rodrik's marriage remains intact, wanting Mira to convince Lady Margaery to send a letter to House Glenmore and \"encourage\" the marriage.\n\nOnce Rodrik begins to recover and is able to walk again, she sees him in the Great Hall, where she informs him that she has invited his betrothed - Lady Elaena Glenmore - to visit him. When Lady Elaena arrives, Elissa gives Rodrik some advice on how to convince her to honor the betrothal despite the undesirable state Rodrik and House Forrester is in. She returns to the Great Hall after Lady Elaena has made her decision and Lord Whitehill makes an unexpected and unwelcome arrival. He demands Rodrik shows him some respect by kneeling and kissing his ring, only agreeing to release Ryon temporarily to attend the funeral of Ethan and Gregor if he does. Desperate to see her youngest son, Elissa advises Rodrik to swallow his pride and kiss Whitehill's ring. Whitehill then overrules, Rodrik by taking all the Ironwood forests, defying House Bolton in the process as well.\n\nLady Elissa attends the funeral of her son, Ethan, and husband, Gregor. If Gwyn Whitehill attends the funeral, Elissa will exhibit her distaste for her in secret to Rodrik. In private, she and Rodrik discuss what to do about the Whitehills. Lady Elissa tells her son that he mustn't let anything stand in his way, even if he has to \"murder ever last Whitehill, down to the babes in their bed\". She then listens to Talia's song for the fallen family members.\n\nElissa first appears when Gryff arrives at Ironrath. Like the rest of the Forresters she is distraught and tries to stop him from overtaking the Great Hall to no avail. Later on she talks with the council about expelling Gryff or saving Ryon from Highpoint, acting as the council member most in favour of saving the youngest Forrester child while Ortengryn and Royland are more vocal about smashing the figurehead of House Whitehill.\n\nWhen Rodrik returns from his meeting with Gwyn, he has the opportunity to discuss Lord Whitehill's plans with Elissa, who is clearing up the great hall. If he reveals that there is a traitor and names a suspect, Elissa will point the finger at whoever Ethan did not elect as Sentinel. When Rodrik faces off with the Whitehill soldiers that arrive in the hall, Harys instructs Elissa to get her son out alive before things get ugly.\n\nElissa is last seen when Gryff confronts Rodrik in the courtyard. She is relatively quiet during the seen, but helps Rodrik up and comments on the choices he made before leading him away.\n\nWhen Rodrik, Elaena, Arthur and the Elite Guard arrive in the courtyard, Elissa appears and tells Rodrik that Gryff Whitehill is harming Maester Ortengryn. They all head for the Great Hall, Elissa helping Ortengryn up and watching as Gryff is captured. She says that they need to keep Gryff alive so he can be traded for Ryon, and stops Rodrik if he takes things too far when punishing Gryff. She says that word of his capture cannot reach Highpoint and orders the death of the ravens.\n\nShe later appears when Talia and Rodrik speak at the tower. She discusses the issue of the traitor if she was told about it, and speaks about the invitation to Highpoint when Duncan and Royland show up. She accompanies Rodrik to Highpoint and says that his Sentinel should come too.\n\nAt Highpoint, Elissa takes a step back and allows Rodrik to handle most of the negotiations. When Ryon is brought out and Ludd threatens to kill him, however, she begins to panic until a trade - a son for a son - is proposed.\n\nRoyland\/Duncan, The Elite Guard(depending on if you brought them with to Highpoint), Elissa and Rodrik return from Ironrath to find it pretty much deserted. Rodrik hears laughter coming from the Great Hall. He enters it and sees Ramsay Snow talking with Talia Forrester. Ramsay stands up and tells Rodrik that men have said he's a man that can't be broken, and that he's decided to come see for himself.\n\nElissa appears when Talia goes to get the guards as ordered by Rodrik after speaking to the traitor. She asks, \"Duncan\/Royland, how could you?\" She is also a part of the discussion after the player makes the choice to kill or imprison the traitor, speaking of Asher's safety when he hits land.\n\nRodrik informs Elissa that Asher was killed upon arrival in Westeros to which she shouts 'No!' and collapses in Elaena Glenmore's arms. She remains in shock for much of the rest of the scene, distraught at the loss of another child.\n\nLater, when Ludd arrives, Elissa joins Rodrik, Beskha and the Sentinel atop Ironrath's walls. She is furious when Ludd forces Ryon to hold up Asher's head on a pike and questions whether the rival House Lord is without limits.\n\nWhen Rodrik returns from Ludd's camp, he encounters Talia who questions where Elissa is. Elissa appears midway through the Battle of Ironrath, saving Rodrik's life by stabbing Harys Whitehill. Unfortunately, this costs Elissa her life, as Harys stabs her with a sword in retaliation. She dies soon after.\n\nAsher informs Elissa of Rodrik sacrifice but warns her that there isn't time to mourn, because the Whitehills are on the move. Elissa is somewhat doubtful that the pit fighters who have travelled with Asher will be sufficient to fight against the Whitehills, but the Sentinel reassures her that they will be a match for the rival army.\n\nElissa is present when Ludd arrives and attempts to talk Asher into marrying Gwyn, which she is firmly against doing. However, she or Asher suggests that they pretend to go along with the offer in order to take out Ludd while his guard is down, setting the stage for the White Engagement. Elissa is against the Sentinel's idea to ambush the Whitehills using the pit fighters, arguing that Ludd could escape in the ensuing chaos, but supports Beskha's idea to use poisoned wine. It is up to the player which method to use. Elissa is present in the Great Hall when Gwyn arrives to speak to Asher. When the rest of the Whitehill family arrived, Lord Ludd Whitehill apologized to her and said \"But at least it's over\" but then she immediately demands to see Ryon and is briefly reunited before he is moved to the opposite end of the room. Elissa then seats herself at the head table. What happens next is determined by the player's choice on how (if at all) to deal with Ludd.\n\nThe Forresters suggest a toast to celebrate Asher and Gwyn's betrothal. Just as Ludd is about to drink the poisoned wine, however, he suggests he and Asher drink from the same cup, in the way of the North, with Asher drinking first. As Asher reaches for the cup, Elissa takes it first and suggests she drinks the wine with Ludd instead, as she and Ludd are the surviving parents of their respective Houses. As Elissa makes to drink from the cup, the player is faced with a choice.\n\nElissa says the House words, 'Iron From Ice', and drinks. Right after she drinks some of the wine, she gave the wine to Ludd then drinks the poisoned wine as well. Elissa begins to succumb to the effects of the poison, and dies, having sacrificed herself to ensure Ludd's death. But Ludd dies first even though Elissa was the first one to drink the poisoned wine.\n\nAsher bats the cup out of Elissa's hand, exposing the poison plan to Ludd. A fight breaks out, Ludd escapes, and Elissa is escorted to safety.\n\nLudd becomes suspicious immediately and a fight soon breaks out between the pit fighters and the Whitehills. Elissa is escorted to safety along with Talia by the Sentinel.\n\nElissa notices that events are not progressing as planned and decided to go to the sentinel to ask what was going on. Gwyn Whitehill looked at Asher and wondered what was going on. But Asher waved his head and raised his arms letting Gwyn know that he doesn't know what Elissa might do. When she learns that Asher intends to marry Gwyn, Gwyn asks her \"Is everything alright?\" and then Elissa replied \"Fine! Thank you...\". Apparently Ludd started getting suspicious and asked \"What are you tow on about? I tought this was a celebration, but there you are bickering like children, over what!\" Gwyn attempted to calm Ludd down and asked Asher if everything's alright. But even if you choose to say that Asher will marry Gwyn or say that his mother isn't feeling well, she will always cry out that it will bring ruin to their house, making the Whitehills suspicious of the Forrester's intentions. Asher looked at Elissa telling her \"That's enough, mother!\". Elissa runs over to Ludd and cuts his face with a dagger, making him fall on the ground with a surprised face. A fight then breaks out and Elissa is escorted to safety.\n\nThe Battle of Ironrath begins, and though Elissa wishes to fight, she is told to flee to safety. However, when Asher is about to be burned by Harys, she stabbed Harys in his back demmanding him to let go of her son (which he did after getting stabbed). Harys then soon gets mad and stabbed her in her stomach. Elissa then weakened and was soon dropped to the ground. Then Asher killed Harys and held Elissa's hand. Eliissa's last words were \"My son...\" then dies.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Elissa_Forrester"}}

He, along with his father and the rest of Meereen's nobility, gather over the walls of the city when Daenerys Targaryen and her army appear before the city gates to lay siege to it.\n\nHis father is crucified in the aftermath of the siege, a matter which he later confronts her about personally. Hizdahr pleads to be allowed to bury him at the Temple of the Graces, to which she agrees, after learning that he had opposed the crucifixion of the slave children as an ill-conceived warning against Daenerys.\n\nSome weeks later, Daenerys tells Jorah Mormont to send Hizdahr to Yunkai as her ambassador. Hizdahr is to offer the Wise Masters a choice: they can \"live in her new world\" and accept the abolition of slavery, or \"die in their old one\" at the hands of the Second Sons sent under the command of Daario Naharis.\n\nHizdahr and Daario return to Meereen to find the Unsullied patrolling the streets in response to attacks by the Sons of the Harpy. Hizdahr is initially happy to report that the Wise Masters have agreed to have Yunkai governed by a council of freed slaves and former Masters. They have even agreed to submit their important decisions to Daenerys for authorization. However, they insist that the city's infamous fighting pits be reopened. Daenerys is furious at this concession and refuses, even though the Wise Masters have agreed that all fighters will be free men who enter the arena willingly. Hizdahr is frustrated when Daenerys ends the argument by declaring that she is a queen, not a politician.\n\nHizdahr later becomes a member of Daenerys's small council, representing the former Great Masters. After White Rat's killer is caught, he and Mossador butt heads over what to do with him. Hizdahr disagrees with Mossador's insistence that the Sons of the Harpy are funded by the Great Masters. Mossador ultimately kills the murderer without Daenerys's consent, and Hizdahr witnesses his execution, voicing his opinion that Daenerys should have killed Mossador inside the pyramid with few witnesses instead of publicly executing him.\n\nOn the day that usually marks the traditional opening of the fighting season Hizdahr again entreats Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits, noted that while it is not a perfect solution, it will at least be enough to bring the Meereenese and Yunkish Masters to the table.\n\nFollowing the skirmish that claimed the life of Ser Barristan Selmy, Hizdahr visits Daenerys to offer his condolences. He and Daario offer advice on how to deal with the Sons of the Harpy, but Daenerys coolly informs them that she will take the heads of Meereen's great houses into custody. When Hizdahr points out that this description applies to him, the Unsullied grab him immediately. Hizdahr and the other heads of house are brought into the catacombs. As the Unsullied drive them forward, Daenerys explains that she has no idea which of them are guilty and which are innocent (including Hizdahr). When Rhaegal appears and roasts one of the Great Masters alive, Hizdahr is the only one of the remaining Masters to remain standing, offering as his defense a halfhearted \"valar morghulis\". Daenerys, having reminded the Great Masters of what she (and her dragons) can do, allows them to leave with their lives, but keeps them under arrest. Later, she visits Hizdahr in his cell. His composure now gone, he prostrates himself before her and begs for mercy, his public calm replaced with terror. Daenerys is pleased that he's now being honest again, and informs him that in the interests of peace she will reopen the Fighting Pits (to free men only). She will also show her respect for Meereen by marrying a member of one of its great families \u2013 and fortuitously, she already has one of them on their knees before her. The Sons of the Harpy attacks cease following the betrothal, which brings Daario to believe that Hizdahr may be involved with them, though Daenerys remains unconvinced. Hizdahr and Daenerys visit a fighting pit in order to honor the lesser pit fighters with their presence. Though Daenerys soon desires to leave when she is disturbed by the violence, Hizdahr persuades her to stay in order to respect traditions. He witnesses Jorah Mormont and Tyrion Lannister reveal themselves to Daenerys in the pit.During the Great Games, Hizdahr is lightly intimidated by Daario, who is obviously jealous of his betrothal to Daenerys, though Hizdahr wins a bet against him over a possible surviving fighter. His beliefs in the traditions of the fighting pits are belittled by both Daenerys and Tyrion, the latter musing that his father would have liked Hizdahr. When the Sons of the Harpy attack Daznak's Pit, Hizdahr attempts to lead Daenerys to safety, but is grabbed and stabbed repeatedly in the chest by four members of the Sons of the Harpy, implying that he had been loyal to Daenerys after all and Daario's theory of him being involved with the Sons of the Harpy was in fact, false. He lives long enough to witness Daenerys being taken to safety by Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hizdahr_zo_Loraq"}}

Loboda seems to show little sign of fear even when he is confronted by a White Walker, and without hesitation engages the Walker in single combat.\n\nWhen Lord Commander Jon Snow and Tormund arrive at Hardhome to offer the Free Folk to retreat to Castle Black and settle south of the Wall, a meeting of the clan chieftains is held, where Loboda represents the Thenns. Loboda doesn't believe the Night's Watch cares about what happens to them, despite the Lord Commander's appeals and his offer of dragonglass as a weapon against the White Walkers, which Loboda dismisses as just as unlikely as the mythical \"ice spiders as big as hounds\". Karsi replies that with everything they have seen none of this is unbelievable. Jon argues Mance Rayder would have supported his suggestion, so Loboda asks what happened to him. When Snow admits he killed him, Loboda prepares to kill him, only to be stopped by Tormund, who reveals it was a mercy kill. Karsi decides to side with the Lord Commander's plan as long as Tormund vouches for him, but Loboda remains stubborn, claiming that all the Free Folk who get on the Crows' boats will be executed, as they have always been enemies and his ancestors would spit on him if he broke bread with a crow. Loboda abandons the hall, and he is followed by many other chieftains, to the dismay of Jon, Tormund, and Karsi, who exclaims she \"fucking hate[s] Thenns.\"\n\nWhile the wildlings who accept Jon's request to return with him are rowed to the boats, an avalanche engulfs thousands of wildlings on the other side of the settlement and a white fog consumes the area, so Loboda quickly orders the gates to be shut, leaving many of the Wildlings to their death by the White Walker army. \n\nLoboda defends the gate while killing several wights. However the massive army of the dead floods the position and breaches some parts of the palisades and scales the defenses. After seeing the White Walkers overseeing battle on one of the peaks. Loboda escorts Jon to retrieve the dragon glass inside the burning hut, and when a White Walker appears, he tells Jon to find the dragon glass while he fights the Walker. After failing to strike down the White Walker twice, Loboda is quickly disarmed when his axe is shattered by the Walker's icy spear. The Walker then impales Loboda through the gut killing him instantly. He is likely among the dead resurrected by the Night's King just as Jon Snow, Eddison Tollett, Tormund, Wun Wun and a few other men manage to escape to the boats.

He was born and grew up in the city.\n\nHot Pie and Lommy Greenhands are recruited to join the Night's Watch. They bully Arya Stark when she joins their group and demand she give up her sword, Needle. Hot Pie claims that he killed a boy once by kicking him to death. When Arya refuses and threatens to kill him like she has with other \"fat boys\", he backpedals and bumps into Gendry, who scares him off.\n\nHot Pie is travelling north on the Kingsroad with Yoren\u2019s recruits.Gold Cloaks from King's Landing come upon them looking for Gendry. Yoren intimidates them into leaving but they promise to return with more men. Later, Arya, Hot Pie and Lommy Greenhands wash cook pots in the stream while Gendry fills a pail with water. Lommy says that they should yield if the gold cloaks return, not wanting to be caught in a battle. Hot Pie claims that he is unafraid of battle and Arya questions his courage. Hot Pie claims to have seen lots of battles and Arya calls him a liar. Hot Pie insists that he saw a man stabbed in the neck outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Lommy tells Hot Pie that two men fighting is not a battle. Hot Pie says that they had armor on. Arya questions the relevance of this and Hot Pie says that if the combatants wear armor, it is automatically a battle. Lommy refutes the assertion and Hot Pie wonders what a dyer's apprentice would know about battle. As Gendry returns to refill the pail, Arya tell Hot Pie that Gendry is an armorer's apprentice. She instructs Hot Pie to relay his definition of a battle to Gendry. Gendry asks who told Hot Pie that. Hot Pie claims that he heard it from a knight. Gendry asks how Hot Pie knew he was a knight and Hot Pie again cites armor as deciding the issue. Gendry explains that anyone can buy armor. Hot Pie asks how Gendry knows and Gendry reminds him that he sold armor.\n\nThe group is resting in a barn when they are roused to arms by Yoren and told they are being attacked. Hot Pie and Lommy arm themselves and Lommy picks up Gendry's helm before they rush outside. They are met by Ser Amory Lorch and a force of men loyal to House Lannister. Lorch points out the Gold Cloaks with him and says that they have come for Gendry, a royal bastard. Lorch orders Yoren and the recruits to drop their weapons. Yoren remains defiant and Lorch orders him shot. Yoren fights on but is eventually overwhelmed.\n\nSeeing their leader killed, Gendry and many of the other recruits join the fight while Hot Pie hides in the bushes. The recruits are quickly defeated and the survivors are taken prisoner. Lorch orders the prisoners taken to Harrenhal. Hot Pie is found in the bushes and is quick to yield. Lommy calls for help from the ground, a crossbow bolt in his left leg. Polliver approaches and asks him if he can walk. Lommy says they will have to carry him. Polliver offers him a hand and then stabs him through the throat, killing him. He tells his companions that Lommy wanted to be carried, drawing a laugh. Lorch pushes over Yoren's corpse and demands that the survivors identify Gendry. Arya says that they have already killed him pointing out the bulls head helm lying next to Lommy.\n\nHot Pie, Gendry and Arya arrive at the ruined castle Harrenhal with a column of other Lannister prisoners. Gendry sees the decimated towers and asks what kind of fire can melt stone. Arya tells him that it was dragon fire and Hot Pie asks if there are dragons there. Gendry says that dragons are extinct and Hot Pie wonders what he can smell. Arya says that it is the smell of dead people. Polliver orders them to walk on into the midst of the ruin.\n\nThey are chained in a stockade with many other prisoners. They can hear the sounds of a man being tortured nearby. The screams end and an old woman says that the victim is dead. She is expressionless and reports in a monotone that her captors have tortured her sister, husband and now her son to death. Gendry realizes that they select a new victim each day. Arya asks if anyone survives the torture and the woman does not answer.\n\nHot Pie and the prisoners are awoken by Ser Amory Lorch and his men. Ser Gregor Clegane approaches the stockade. Hot Pie says that he is the one who chooses the prisoners and Arya recognizes him. Hot Pie stares at him as he approaches and Arya asks what he is doing. Hot Pie says that another prisoner told him that he always stares at the mountain and is never chosen. Hot Pie and his new friend stare at Gregor as he surveys the captives. Gregor selects the staring prisoner. Hot Pie wets himself in fear. The prisoner is strapped to a chair by Weasel as the Tickler questions him. He is asked about hidden valuable in his village and the whereabouts of the Brotherhood. A rat is placed in a bucket and strapped to his chest. Weasel heats the bucket to provoke the rat into burrowing through his chest. The Tickler asks who aided the Brotherhood and the prisoner implicates Ganes the butcher and his son. He begs them to stop and the Tickler says that he has been very helpful but continues with the torture regardless. Hot Pie and the other prisoners watch, helpless to stop them.\n\nThe head of the tortured prisoner is hammered onto a spike above the stockade. Gendry is chosen by Gregor and his questioning begins despite him not being from the village. Lord Tywin Lannister arrives and halts the torture. He orders the prisoners put to work and recognizes that Arya is a girl. Tywin says that she will be his new cup bearer. While working in the castle Hot Pie comes across the corpse of the Tickler, apparently having been murdered in broad daylight.\n\nHot Pie is talking to Gendry about recipes, when Arya comes by looking for Jaqen, but he doesn't know where Jaqen is. Lord Tywin leaves Harrenhal under Gregor's command. Arya arranges to escape with assistance from Jaqen H'ghar. Hot Pie steals food from the kitchens for their journey and goes along despite his fear. They are to walk out of the gate at midnight, but guards are posted there. It isn't until they begin walking to the gate that they realize that the guards are dead and nailed to their posts.\n\nAfter escaping Harrenhal, they see Jaqen H'ghar standing on a small cliff above them, and Arya leaves the others to go to talk to him.\n\nHot Pie and Gendry criticize Arya for not asking Jaqen H'ghar to kill the contenders for the Iron Throne and ending the war. They are all captured by the Brotherhood without Banners. The Brotherhood takes them to the Inn at the Crossroads and feeds them, but before they can depart, Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane is brought in as a prisoner, and in surprise, identifies Arya Stark.\n\nAs they get ready to leave, Hot Pie explains that he isn't going with them: he baked some bread for the innkeeper, and as he was a baker's apprentice when he lived in King's Landing, the innkeeper thought it was the best bread they'd ever had, and offered him a job. This life of fighting and travelling isn't really for him, plus Thoros formally made a deal with the inn to give them Hot Pie's services to pay for all of the meals the Brotherhood had there. He also points out that his brother is no king and he is no Stark of \"Winterhell\", earning a harsh correction of the name from Arya. Before they go, he gives Arya a present he made for her: a loaf of bread shaped like a direwolf, though Arya implies the tail looks like a head. Arya is a bit brusque but the three wish each other well as they depart, and as they are riding away Arya starts eating the wolf-bread, and turns back to shout to Hot Pie that it is very good.\n\nBrienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne stop at the inn to dine and Hot Pie serves them a kidney pie he made. Hot Pie tells them at length the process in finding the right ingredients for the kidney pie, despite their obvious lack of interest. He asks if Brienne is a knight as she is wearing armor, he then asks of Brienne's business. When she tells him they're looking for the Stark sisters, Hot Pie leaves abruptly after claiming he'd heard the Starks were all traitors. \n\nAs Brienne and Podrick prepare to leave the inn, Hot Pie approaches them and hands Brienne a loaf of bread shaped like a wolf and mentions that it is better than the last. He tells them he was with Arya travelling to the North to join the Night's Watch, before being captured by the Lannisters, and then being captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners. He explains that the last time he saw Arya was when the Brotherhood departed the inn, along with their prisoner The Hound, and that they intended to ransom her back to her family at Riverrun. Brienne and Podrick quickly (and correctly) deduce that because Arya's mother and brother were killed at the Red Wedding, anyone trying to ransom her would now head to her next closest surviving relative with money and power: her maternal aunt Lysa Arryn, ruler of the Vale. Leaving Hot Pie at the inn, they depart for the Eyrie.\n\nHe meets up with Arya when she arrives at the Inn, where he informs her of all the recent events in Westeros, notably the Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. However, he then notes upon the fact that House Bolton is defeated and Jon Snow is now King in the North. This changes Arya's travel plans, as she originally wanted to go south to defeat Cersei, but chooses her family over her lust for revenge. She then tries to pay Hot Pie, but he rejects it, saying that friends don't need to pay for the ale and the pie. He then remarks on his stupidity for not realizing her femininity and that she is now pretty. Before she leaves, Arya tells her friend to not get killed.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hot_Pie"}}

At this point, Ghost arrives to defend him, snarling at them; unwilling to take their chances against the angry direwolf, they flee.\n\nAfter Jon is fatally stabbed by several of his black brothers, Ghost howls in mourning from his pen nearby. His cries summon Davos Seaworth, Eddison Tollett, and a handful of other black brothers who quickly move his body. On Davos's suggestion, Edd frees Ghost so that he can help them protect Jon's body. On their way back to Jon's quarters, Edd and Ghost are accosted by Thorne and the mutineers. Ghost snarls angrily at Thorne, aware of his role in Jon's murder. Unnerved, Thorne suggests that they release Ghost beyond the Wall, but Edd refuses and leads Ghost to Jon's chamber, where he sniffs Jon's body mournfully. When the mutineers offer the loyalists peace terms through the locked door, Ghost growls angrily.  At nightfall, the mutineers attempt to break their way into Jon's chambers to kill Davos and the loyalists. Ghost stands beside the loyalists, ready to fight to the death. Edd and the wildlings arrive in time to save Ghost and the loyalists, and place the mutineers in custody.

It is these qualities that allowed him to defect from the Night's Watch to join the Free Folk, and quickly rise to the title of King-Beyond-The-Wall. Mance's exceptional social skills enabled him to unite the diverse wildling clans, no matter how different they were from one another or how much they wanted to kill one another. Mance is also very aware of the threat the White Walkers will pose to the entire world and used it to his advantage in convincing the wildlings to unite as a singular army. Because of his honest yet stern persona, he earned the respect and admiration of the toughest of wildlings and even giants. Mance states himself, however, that his trusting nature is also a weakness of his; having honestly let himself believe that Jon Snow was truly defecting from the Night's Watch as he did. However, even when faced with such betrayal or adversity, Mance keeps a calm and level-headed attitude, not even growing overly angry when discovering Snow's attempt to assassinate him. Above all else, Mance cherishes the Free Folk and their culture, performing dangerous and world-changing actions in the hopes of finding them safety from the coming winter.\n\nDespite their feuds with one another, the various tribes of the Free Folk all held Mance in very high regard; Tormund Giantsbane, who had been Mance's friend and comrade for many years, was visibly distressed on witnessing Mance's death, and when the Free Folk at Hardhome were informed of how he had died, they initially tried to kill Jon Snow in revenge until Tormund talked them out of it.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mance_Rayder"}}

Brynden openly admitted that it was a good match and an opportunity for House Tully to ally with a very rich House.\n\nHowever, Brynden refused to take part in the marriage, saying at the time that he would not simply be told when and whom to marry. From Hoster's point of view, many Tullys in past generations had been asked to do their duty for the good of the House and enter into arranged marriages to secure powerful alliances: even Brynden did not deny that it was a good match, but nonetheless refused to further the fortunes of his family. This led to a severe argument between the two brothers that would last much of the rest of their lives. Hoster called Brynden the \"black goat\" of the Tully herd, but considering their family's heraldry of a silver trout, Brynden joked that it would be more apt to say he was the black fish of the Tully school - the nickname stuck with Brynden ever since, and he even took a black trout as his personal sigil.\n\nBrynden somewhat rued his decision years later during Robert's Rebellion: House Redwyne controls one of the largest fleets in Westeros, based at the Arbor, and this could have been added to the rebels' side. Instead, the Redwynes stayed loyal to the Targaryens.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bethany_Redwyne"}}

Yet while the Targaryens had nominally converted to the Faith of the Seven, the dominant religion in Westeros, they never wholly accepted it - specifically, the Faith's strict condemnation of incest, which it held to be an abomination. The Targaryens had incestuously married brother to sister for generations (whenever possible) to \"keep the bloodline pure\", in the custom of their Valyrian ancestors. For that matter, Aegon I broke not only the Faith's rules against incest, but its rules against polygamy, as he was married to both of his sisters at the same time: Queen Visenya and Queen Rhaenys.\n\nThe Faith wasn't in much position to challenge the victorious Targaryen army after the Conquest or their massive dragons, but Aegon I was wise enough to tread lightly with the Faith: both sides tacitly agreed that the Targaryens' incestuous marriages were a relic of their past, which would soon fade. Aegon I didn't intend for future generations of his new dynasty to continue to have incestuous marriages, and in return, the Faith didn't press the matter for the remainder of his life. Aegon I eventually died and was succeeded by his elder son, Aenys I Targaryen, his only child by his sister-wife Rhaenys.\n\nTo the surprise of all, however, later in his reign King Aenys tactlessly wed his daughter to his own son. The incestuous marriage of Princess Rhaena and Prince Aegon broke the Targaryens' prior promise to the Faith, which could stand the abomination no longer.

Logically, though, as the son of a tavern girl he probably wasn't living in good conditions before he began to work for Mott as a teenager."],"name":"Gendry","description":"King Robert's actual son Gendry is everything that his alleged son and heir Joffrey Baratheon was not - beyond simply his physical appearance, but also his character and temperament. Joffrey was an arrogant, sadistic fop, with a massive sense of entitlement. He was not skilled at anything - particularly not at combat, in which he was also a coward when faced with real danger. Joffrey's one real claim to importance was that he was Robert's son - which was itself a lie. Gendry, in contrast, is his exact opposite: a generally humble and polite working-class blacksmith who didn't grow up rich in a castle, and a brave and capable fighter when his friends are in danger. He also needlessly defends the boy \"Arry\" when he sees the other recruits picking on (what he thinks is) a smaller boy. Unlike Joffrey, who thought the throne was his by right but was utterly unsuited to rule, Gendry has many qualities which would make a fine king, but doesn't even know he has a potential claim to it. Growing up having to work for a living, at Mott's smithy, Gendry also grew up disciplined, and doesn't have any of his father Robert's negative qualities of self-indulgence (in food, drink, and women).\n\nGendry is notably an extremely pragmatic and practical young man, as evidenced by his ability to understand how social standing benefits people unlike him: he understood that if he returned to Riverrun with Arya, she would be his 'lady' rather than his friend. This sets him further apart from Joffrey, who outright fell back on social standing and had massive delusions of grandeur where his own position was concerned. Joffrey accentuated his title as king to be the reason that he should get his way, whereas Gendry fought and survived for other people and was not as arrogant or temperamental as Joffrey. Also, he was surprisingly self-reproachful about his own actions, shown prominently in the aftermath of Melisandre seducing him; Joffrey was not the slightest bit self-reproachful, never blaming himself for anything even if he were the central catalyst for an incident. Joffrey would brutalize women at court, taking out his frustrations by having his guards publicly beat Sansa Stark and citing his authority as king when Tyrion Lannister confronted him about it. In a direct parallel, Gendry is polite and deferential to her sister Arya Stark when he learns who she is, worried at his behavior and insisting on addressing her with formal titles.\n\nGendry is still somewhat self-conscious about being a commoner, with a commoner's lot in life. Like many of them, he is terrified and subservient when he encounters members of the nobility, while somewhat resenting the great lords for oppressing the lower classes and tearing Westeros apart with their bloody wars. Nevertheless, he readily agrees to help the King in the North Jon Snow, both for his mutual dislike of the Lannisters and his father's past alliance with the Starks.\n\nThough he has no formal combat training, Gendry is remarkably skilled with a hammer, both as a weapon and a tool. While escaping from King's Landing, he effortlessly killed two curious Gold Cloaks with a war hammer, having inherited his father's incredible strength. This strength has been a prevalent factor throughout his life, as he commented to Hot Pie that when he strikes steel with a hammer it 'sings'. A glaring difference between him and his father is that Gendry does not love fighting, whereas Robert Baratheon absolutely lived for fighting.\n\nGendry seems now to take some pride in his Baratheon blood, hating the Lannisters for killing his father Robert and immediately informing Jon Snow that he is Robert's bastard son, knowing his father and Jon's (adoptive) father were best friends.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gendry"}}

She has a younger brother, Edmure, and a younger sister, Lysa. Petyr Baelish was fostered with the Tullys and Catelyn grew up with him. She was betrothed to marry Brandon Stark of Winterfell, but he was brutally murdered along with his father, Lord Rickard Stark, by the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, after his Prince Rhaegar purportedly kidnapped Brandon's sister Lyanna. Catelyn instead married Brandon's brother, Eddard. Though they barely knew one another when they wed, they have formed a strong and loving marriage. Catelyn and Eddard have five children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. She is unhappy with Eddard's bastard son, Jon Snow, living with her family in Winterfell, the only source of friction between her and her husband.\n\nCatelyn has some independent political influence. A former ward of her father's, Petyr Baelish, known as \"Littlefinger\", is the king's master of coin and one of his closest advisers in King's Landing.\n\nCatelyn says that she hasn't been to the capital city of King's Landing since nine years before her husband went there to be the new Hand of the King, which would be around the time of the Greyjoy Rebellion.\n\nCatelyn and Eddard watch as their sons practice archery. Ser Rodrik Cassel arrives to tell them that a deserter from the Night's Watch has been captured. Eddard decides to take their sons Robb and Bran to watch him execute the deserter despite Catelyn's protest that Bran is too young. While they are gone they find a litter of five direwolf pups (the animal that is the sigil of House Stark) and Eddard agrees to allow their children to adopt the wolves.\n\nA raven bears news of Jon Arryn's death to Winterfell, where Catelyn tells Eddard the bad news. She also tells him that King Robert Baratheon, and much of the royal court rides for Winterfell. Eddard realizes that Robert means to name him Hand of the King in Arryn's place, a prospect that does not thrill him.\n\nCatelyn joins her husband in welcoming King Robert and his family. At the feast, she and Queen Cersei Lannister exchange cordial words once they learn that Robert means to marry Prince Joffrey to Sansa. Cersei approves of Sansa and thinks she will thrive at court in the capital. Later that night, Eddard and Catelyn receive a letter, delivered to Maester Luwin by a messenger from the Eyrie. The letter is from Catelyn's sister, Lady Lysa Arryn, the widow of Jon Arryn. In the letter, Lysa says that Jon Arryn was murdered at the order of the Queen, and the Lannisters conspire against King Robert. Luwin counsels that Eddard should accept Robert's offer so he can investigate the truth of the matter and protect the King, while Catelyn prefers that he remain in Winterfell. Eddard agrees with Luwin and accepts the offer. He plans to take both of their daughters to court with him.\n\nCatelyn tends to Bran after he falls from a tower, and prays for his recovery. Cersei visits Catelyn, sitting by her son's side, and tells her that her first child, a beautiful, black-haired boy, was stillborn. She and Robert were grief-stricken and her prayers and tears were for naught. She offers to pray for Bran's survival, hoping that this time the gods will listen. Jon Snow gives his farewell wishes to Bran, to Catelyn's disgust. Eddard also says his goodbyes to his son and to Catelyn, who is angered at his departure while Bran remains comatose.\n\nCatelyn's refusal to leave Bran's side starts to cause problems for the smooth running of the castle. Robb offers to work with Maester Luwin to fill vacancies left by the departure of Eddard's retinue. Robb is drawn away from Bran's room by a fire. This proves to be a distraction to allow an assassin to reach Bran. Catelyn holds the assassin off long enough for Summer to enter the chamber and tear out his throat. The next day, Catelyn goes to the tower where Bran fell and finds a blonde strand of hair inside. She summons Robb, Theon Greyjoy, Luwin and Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, and tells that that she suspects that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran because he saw something in the tower. Robb and Theon are for making war, but Luwin schools them to caution. Catelyn decides that Ned must know the truth and resolves to meet him in King's Landing. Ser Rodrik escorts her, while Robb commands the castle in her absence. Bran awakens after her departure but is paralysed by his injuries.\n\nCatelyn and Ser Rodrik arrive at King's Landing and attempt to sneak into the city, but are spotted by an agent of Lord Petyr Baelish (also called \"Littlefinger\"), a childhood friend of Catelyn. They are taken to meet Littlefinger at a brothel he owns, where Lord Varys, the king's spymaster, is also waiting: one of his 'little birds' told him they were coming. Catelyn is angered by the way she's been treated, but asks Littlefinger for aid in finding the people who tried to have Bran killed. Littlefinger says that the elaborate dagger wielded by the assassin used to be his, but that he lost it in a gamble with Tyrion Lannister. Littlefinger fetches Eddard to meet his wife. Lord Eddard is furious when he realizes he has been brought to a brothel. Thinking it is a bad joke, he assaults Baelish, and is stunned when Catelyn makes her presence known and tells him to stop. After hearing her news, he vows to find the truth and expose the Lannisters to Robert. Littlefinger agrees to be his ally in this, citing the affection he once bore Catelyn as a youngster.\n\nReturning to Winterfell, Catelyn and Ser Rodrik stop at the Crossroads Inn, planning to stay overnight. They are surprised by the arrival of Tyrion Lannister. Catelyn fails to stay incognito, then she calls on several knights present who are sworn to her father's bannermen to help her take Tyrion into custody. Catelyn publicly announces that they are traveling north to Winterfell, but instead takes Tyrion east into the Vale of Arryn. In the hills they are attacked by warriors of the hill tribes, and Catelyn agrees to let Tyrion go unbound to defend himself. Tyrion saves Catelyn's life, but wins no more of her trust. Tyrion warns Catelyn that her sister Lysa has become mentally unbalanced following her husband's death. His warning rings true when on reaching the Eyrie Lysa and her hysterical son, Lord Robin Arryn, order Tyrion thrown into a sky cell, a prison with a wall that opens onto a sheer drop.\n\nTyrion protests his innocence and demands a trial by combat. The sellsword Bronn, who accompanied the party from the Crossroads Inn, agrees to stand for Tyrion. Bronn defeats Ser Vardis Egen, who takes Lady Lysa's part. Tyrion's victory signifies his innocence in the eyes of the gods and he is released.\n\nCatelyn lingers at the Eyrie trying to convince Lysa to commit the Vale's knights to oppose the Lannisters. Lysa is unwilling to take any action which might endanger her son. Catelyn finally decides to leave after Lysa delays telling her about Eddard's arrest in King's Landing following King Robert's death. Catelyn and Ser Rodrik ride north and meet Robb's army as he marches south. They join his war council, though Catelyn is careful to not embarrass her son or make him appear indecisive. Catelyn points out that to confront the two Lannister armies that have invaded the Riverlands, her father's lands, Robb's army must cross the Green Fork of the River Trident at the Twins, which means negotiating with the famously unreliable and prickly Lord Walder Frey. To Robb's discontent, Catelyn goes into the Twins alone and wins Walder to their cause by agreeing that Robb will marry one of his daughters, along with a number of other, minor concessions. Once across the river Robb divides his forces, sending a small force to delay Lord Tywin Lannister's army while Robb force-marches his main force to confront Jaime Lannister near Riverrun. Robb wins a great victory and takes Jaime Lannister prisoner, to Catelyn's pride.\n\nWord reaches the camp that Lord Eddard has been executed. Catelyn walks stone faced through the camp, while the men bow to her showing respect. Once in the woods she falls against a tree and weeps. Hearing noise coming from ahead, she goes on to find Robb striking a tree with his sword. Catelyn calls him, then tells him that he is ruining his sword. Robb drops the sword and collapses in her arms. Robb wants to kill them all, his mother says they will, but after they secure the release of Arya and Sansa. They are joined by many of the river lords loyal to Catelyn's father, and word arrives that both Stannis and Renly Baratheon have claimed the Iron Throne, severely outnumbering the Lannisters. The northmen and river lords debate on which king to support, until Lord Greatjon Umber suggests that they secure independence for themselves. He names Robb as King in the North, and the other lords join him. Catelyn visits the captive Jaime Lannister, who admits to pushing Bran from the tower but doesn't reveal why. He taunts her, saying widowhood suits her and suggests that the gods aren't real as they don't care about justice. Catelyn strikes him, but Jaime knows that the Starks won't kill him as long as his sister holds Sansa and Arya hostage.\n\nCatelyn is a key advisor to her son Robb Stark in his role as King in the North. She warns Robb against trusting Balon Greyjoy because of his reputation for rebellion. She unsuccessfully tries to persuade Robb to exchange the captive Jaime Lannister for his sisters Arya and Sansa. Robb tasks her with traveling to the Stormlands to seek an alliance with King Renly Baratheon.\n\nCatelyn travels to Renly's camp and finds him hosting a tournament. She watches Brienne win the event and a place on Renly's kingsguard. Catelyn delivers Robb's message and admonishes Renly for treating the war as a game. She is welcomed into Renly's camp by his new wife Margaery Tyrell.Petyr Baelish also arrives at the camp. Catelyn confronts him for his betrayal of Ned and rejects his romantic overtures. He delivers a message from Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister; he would be willing to exchange Jaime for Catelyn's daughters. Tyrion has also sent Ned's remains as a sign of good faith. Catelyn later accompanies Renly to a parley with his brother King Stannis Baratheon but the two are unable to reach a compromise.\n\nCatelyn sees Renly assassinated by a Shadow just after he has agreed to an alliance with Robb. His kingsguard Brienne is mistakenly blamed for the death and she flees the camp with Catelyn. Brienne later swears fealty to Catelyn. Renly's army splinters with the forces of House Tyrell fleeing to Highgarden and the rest of his bannermen joining Stannis. Stannis leads his army in an unsuccessful attack on King's Landing. He is defeated by the newly allied forces of House Lannister and House Tyrell.\n\nCatelyn finds Robb's army camped in the Westerlands. She interrupts him talking to Talisa Maegyr and warns him that he is not free to follow his heart. Roose Bolton brings troubling news from Winterfell; Theon Greyjoy has betrayed Robb and seized the lightly defended castle. Theon has taken both Bran and Rickon hostage. Robb denies Catelyn's request to treat with Theon and says that he will execute the traitor. Roose convinces Robb to let his bastard retake Winterfell.\n\nJaime escapes but is soon recaptured. Robb is away negotiating the surrender of the Crag. Lord Rickard Karstark demands Jaime's head because he murdered his son Torrhen Karstark in the escape attempt. Catelyn convinces Rickard to await Robb's return but fears that his patience will not last the night.\n\nShe visits Jaime's cell and accuses him of being a man without honor. Jaime asserts that he has more honor than some; he reveals that Cersei is the only one he has slept with and reminds Catelyn how her husband cheated on her and fathered Jon Snow. Catelyn releases Jaime, planning to exchange him for her captive daughters. She sends Brienne to escort him to King's Landing. Brienne successfully smuggles him out of the camp and travels by rowboat to evade pursuit. Robb is furious that Catelyn acted behind his back and orders her kept under guard. He says that Jaime has played her for a fool and that she has weakened their position.\n\nRobb visits Catelyn in her tent to discuss his plan to break his betrothal to House Frey to marry Talisa. She reveals that Eddard did not love her when they first married and explains that they built a strong, enduring love over time. She warns against recklessly breaking his oath for passion but he says that she has no right to call anyone reckless. Going against his mother's advice, Robb marries Talisa in secret.\n\nCatelyn, still Robb's prisoner is among the Northern forces that march on Harrenhal, only to find the castle abandoned, and the 200 prisoners slain. Among the dead, Catelyn identifies the body of Ser Jaremy Mallister, her father's bannerman. Robb then orders his mother imprisoned within the fortress.\n\nLord Roose Bolton delivers two messenger-raven missives, each of which brings bad news. First, Catelyn's father Hoster Tully has finally died after a long illness at his castle of Riverrun. Second, Roose delivers a letter from his bastard son Ramsay Snow, falsely stating that the ironborn torched Winterfell and put all of its inhabitants to the sword, and then fled all before his force arrived there. There has been no sighting of Bran or Rickon, and though Robb hopes that they are still alive, there is a strong possibility that they are dead. Moreover, there has been no word of Theon, and if he took the boys captive the Greyjoys haven't sent out any demands. This double-blow reduces Catelyn to tears and she laments that she had not seen her father in years. She is horrified at the thought that Bran and Rickon were in danger while she was away and could not protect them, and are now likely dead.\n\nTalisa notices that Catelyn is making a prayer wheel for the Faith of the Seven, and offers to help. Catelyn explains that they can only be made by mothers who are praying for the welfare of their children. Catelyn reveals that she has only made them twice before, one of which was when she was praying for Bran to wake from his coma, which worked after a fashion, as he did survive though he lost the use of his legs. Talisa asks after the other time, and Catelyn says that when they were younger, one of the boys had a pox, and Maester Luwin said that if he survived the night he would be all right, but if he didn't he would die. Catelyn explains that the boy was Jon Snow, and at first the thought that Jon would conveniently die of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the Seven for his end. However, Catelyn then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing, particularly as Jon was an innocent child, and the person Catelyn really hated was Jon's unidentified mother. So she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all night, praying to the gods that if they forgave her earlier wish that Jon would die, she promised she would urge Eddard to have Jon legitimized as a Stark and she would raise him as her own son. Jon recovered, however, Catelyn did not keep her promise. In grief at the death of her father and apparent death of her two youngest sons, and her continued grief at losing Eddard, Catelyn says the gods are punishing her with this war. At Riverrun in the Riverlands, the castle-seat of House Tully, the funeral of the recently deceased Lord Hoster Tully is held on the banks of the Red Fork of the Trident River. In Catelyn's old chamber in the castle, she mourns with her uncle Brynden over her father's death. She asks him if he made peace with his older brother, whom he had been fighting with for the past thirty years. Brynden explains that he did: on his deathbed Hoster told him to stop calling himself \"the Blackfish\" as it was a stupid joke created over thirty years ago by Brynden to symbolize his bad relationship with his older brother, and it wasn't very funny to begin with. Brynden emotionally laments that he's been calling himself \"the Blackfish\" of the Tully family for so long that he's practically forgotten his own name. Catelyn is happy that her uncle was able to make peace with her father before he passed, and is upset that she couldn't have been there. She reminisces that she watched from this window in her childhood whenever her father left, but now he won't be coming back. She tearfully wonders if her sons Bran and Rickon similarly watched at Winterfell for her return when she failed to arrive to save them. Brynden insists that neither he nor Robb have given up hope that the boys may be alive and in hiding, and urges her to be strong for Robb.\n\nWhen Lord Rickard Karstark murders the prisoners Willem and Martyn Lannister in their cells, Robb is disgusted and insists that Rickard be executed. Edmure Tully, Catelyn's brother, insists that if word of this leaves Riverrun, Tywin Lannister will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews. Therefore, he suggests that they just quietly bury the boys, and simply keep silent about their deaths until the war is over. Robb, however, refuses to be a liar, sayinh he cannot fight a war in the name of justice if he will not serve justice to murderers within his own ranks. All of Robb's advisors tell him this is a bad idea. Catelyn and Talisa warn him that the Karstark soldiers will abandon his cause and return home if he executes their lord, and they are already badly outnumbered. Catelyn says they should keep Lord Rickard hostage, and Edmure agrees, adding to tell the other Karstarks that no harm will come to him so long as they remain loyal.\n\nRobb ignores their pleas, and he has Lord Karstark brought out to the courtyard of Riverrun to be executed during a driving rainstorm. Karstark points out that not only are both of their Houses descended from the First Men, but the Starks and Karstarks are kin (as House Karstark is a cadet branch of House Stark, founded centuries ago by younger son Karlon Stark). Robb says that their blood relationship did not stop Rickard from betraying him and won't stop Robb from executing him now, but Rickard says it isn't meant to: he wants it to haunt Robb until the day he dies. With his last words, Lord Rickard says that Robb will be cursed (as a kinslayer) and that Robb is no king of his. Obedient to the laws of his father Eddard Stark - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - Robb pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads Lord Rickard.\n\nRobb and his advisors meet with \"Black Walder\" and Lothar Frey to discuss an alliance for his planned attack on Casterly Rock. The Freys carry Walder Frey's demands for an alliance, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle Harrenhal and all of its lands and incomes, and for Edmure Tully to marry Roslin, one of his daughters. Edmure is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced by the group to go through with the arrangement.\n\nIn the Riverlands, en route to The Twins, Robb Stark's army is forced to make camp, their progress delayed by heavy rain. Catelyn warns them that the prickly Lord Walder Frey will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him, but Edmure Tully points out that Frey is getting the wedding he wanted; his sister counters that he is getting a wedding, but not the one he wanted, glaring at her son and his wife as she says so, pointing out that Frey wanted one of his daughters wed to a king. Robb retorts that Edmure is the best match House Frey has been offered in its history.\n\nRobb's army arrives at the Twins, the castle seat of House Frey, for his Edmure's wedding. Enduring Lord Walder Frey's insults directed at him and his wife, Robb makes a public apology to Lord Frey's daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them. Frey accepts the apology and offers the Starks and their men his hospitality.  That night Edmure is introduced to his bride Roslin Frey, discovering much to his relief that she is a beauty. The wedding and the feast that follows it are quite celebratory and lively affairs, with all the participants in high spirits. As the celebrations reach their heights Lord Walder calls for the bedding ceremony. Robb agrees and the bride and groom are carried off to their wedding bed, Roslin carried off by the male guests and followed closely by Edmure, who is collected by the Frey women. After they leave and the festivities begin to wind down, Catelyn becomes suspicious when she notices Black Walder Rivers close the banquet hall doors and the musicians in the gallery begin playing \"The Rains of Castamere\"- the song commemorating House Lannister's decisive and brutal victory against the rebellious House Reyne of Castamere. Walder rises to make a toast to Robb, and Catelyn, seated beside Lord Roose Bolton, notices that the latter is wearing mail under his clothing. Realising they are in a trap, Catelyn slaps Roose across the face and screams a warning to Robb, but by then it is too late. Lord Walder signals his men to attack. In what becomes known as the infamous Red Wedding, Lothar draws a knife and repeatedly stabs the pregnant Talisa in the stomach, killing her. Before he can react, Robb is shot by the musicians with crossbows several times and falls to the ground. Numerous other Stark men are killed by the crossbow bolts or set upon by Frey soldiers.\n\nCatelyn, having been wounded by a crossbow bolt, crawls across the floor and seizes out from under Walder's table his cowering young wife, Joyeuse. Catelyn holds a knife to the girl's throat and threatens to kill her if Walder does not negotiate an end to the attack. She demands that Robb, who merely lingers despondent and heartbroken beside his wife's corpse, be allowed to leave. Walder refuses her, dismissing his wife with the comment \"I'll find another\" and Roose Bolton, who had fled the hall when the massacre began, seizes Robb, saying \"The Lannisters send their regards\", before stabbing him in the heart. Robb's last word is \"Mother\" and he maintains contact with her as he collapses to the floor. Mad with grief at the death of her firstborn son, Catelyn kills Walder's wife in retaliation before Black Walder cuts Catelyn's throat.\n\nEmotionally crushed by the deaths of Catelyn and Robb, Sansa refuses to eat despite pleas from Shae. When Tyrion attempts to comfort her, she reveals to him that she lies awake all night thinking about how her mother and brother died, having learned that the Freys had sewn Grey Wind's head onto Robb's decapitated corpse. Her mother\u2019s corpse was also desecrated by being flung like trash from the battlements of the Twins into the Trident to rot, an apparent mockery of traditional House Tully funeral customs. Despite the fact that Catelyn tried to have him executed, even after he saved her life, Tyrion tells Sansa that he admired her mother, saying she was a strong woman who was fierce when it came to protecting her children. He tells Sansa that Catelyn would want her to carry on. Sansa excuses herself to go to godswood where she is later watched by Jaime and Brienne, who reminds the former of the promise he made to Catelyn. Jaime acknowledges this but counters that the situation has become quite complicated due to multiple factors: Catelyn is now dead, Arya hasn\u2019t been seen since Ned\u2019s execution, and Sansa is now married to Tyrion.\n\nJaime\u2019s dilemma to fulfill his oath to Catelyn becomes even more complicated when Joffrey is later fatally poisoned at his own wedding and Sansa flees with Dontos Hollard in the commotion. A vengeful Cersei summons Jaime to her chambers, inquiring why Catelyn set him free. Jaime replies that he swore by all the gods that if Catelyn\u2019s daughters were still alive, he would return them to their mother. Cersei continues grilling Jaime to determine if he has no loyalty to Catelyn, asking if he would bring her Sansa\u2019s head, but Jaime remains silent. He later tasks Brienne with finding Sansa to keeping her safe from those who would hand her over to Cersei, giving her the Valyrian steel sword that his father had reforged from Ned\u2019s own sword Ice. Before departing, Brienne names the sword \"Oathkeeper\" and vows to find Sansa, for the sake of Jaime and Lady Catelyn.\n\nAt the Eyrie, Lysa regales Sansa with her childhood memories about Catelyn. However, she grows angry when Sansa almost mentions Littlefinger's love-triangle with Catelyn, something which has irked Lysa for years. She later becomes insanely jealous after witnessing Littlefinger (who is now married to her) kiss Sansa and threatens to throw her niece out the Moon Door but Littlefinger interrupts. Assuming a softer tone, Littlefinger manages to subdue Lysa before revealing to her horror that the only woman he ever really loved was Catelyn and pushing her out the Moon Door to her death. En route to the Bloody Gate, Brienne and Podrick Payne stumble upon Arya and Sandor Clegane, who have just returned from The Eyrie after hearing of Lysa\u2019s death. Upon realizing that she finally caught up with one of Catelyn\u2019s daughters, Brienne beseeches Arya to come with her but the Hound casts aspersions on Brienne\u2019s intentions. Each of them believing they should be the one to look after Arya, Brienne and the Hound engage in a brutal fight that ends with the latter being knocked off a cliff. However, an ever-wary Arya hides from Brienne and Pod, making the former miss her first chance to fulfill her oath to Catelyn.\n\nEventually, Brienne catches up with Sansa sitting at an inn with Littlefinger. Although they are surrounded by guards, she approaches them and reveals to Sansa that she swore an oath to Catelyn to keep her safe, but doesn't mention her run-in with Arya in Baelish's presence. Baelish counters by telling Sansa that Brienne, a complete stranger, swore oaths to protect both Catelyn and Renly Baratheon and failed at both, which prompts Sansa to reject Brienne\u2019s offer. Despite this second setback, Brienne remains steadfast in her pledge to Catelyn and continues to follow Sansa all the way back to Winterfell.\n\nWhen Sansa and Theon escape from the clutches of Ramsay Bolton, they are immediately set upon and nearly recaptured by half a dozen Bolton soldiers, but Brienne and Podrick intervene. Once the soldiers are dead, Brienne once again offers her service to Sansa, who readily accepts this time, fulfilling part of her pledge to Catelyn.\n\nMeanwhile, Catelyn's uncle Brynden, who fortuitously escaped the Red Wedding, manages to retake Riverrun from the Freys, drawing both Brienne and Jaime there for opposite purposes. When Jaime parleys with the Blackfish, the latter quips that he assumes Jaime is there to fulfill his vow to Catelyn but he doesn't see her daughters. When their meeting goes nowhere, Jaime discreetly meets with Brienne upon her arrival, he allows her to negotiate with the Blackfish so that Brynden and his men can leave the castle at night to travel to Winterfell. Before she leaves, she points out that if she is unsuccessful, then she will be compelled by honor to Catelyn to fight against Jaime. Jaime voices his hope that it doesn't come to that. Afterwards, Jaime pays a visit to the captive Edmure, and the two of them reminisce about Catelyn. Jaime mentions how she once hit him on the head with a rock when he was her prisoner, prompting Edmure to laugh. Though she undoubtedly hated him, Jaime claims he didn't hate Catelyn, even going so far as to say he actually admired her more than Eddard or Robb. Still, Jaime is ultimately successful in helping the Freys retake Riverrun, which culminates in the death of the Blackfish.\n\nHowever, Catelyn is finally avenged shortly afterward by her daughter Arya when she assassinates Walder Frey and his sons, Black Walder and Lothar.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Catelyn_Stark"}}

She didn't touch a man until three years after that, however, and in the intervening years was instructed in the art of seduction. She spent fifteen years there before being bought by Viserys Targaryen, making her approximately twenty-four years old during the first season.\n\nDoreah is bought as a wedding gift for Daenerys Targaryen by her brother Viserys Targaryen, intending her to serve as a handmaid. Viserys is an exiled Prince from Westeros and has arranged his sister's marriage to the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo to attempt to reclaim his crown. Doreah tells Daenerys a story of the origin of dragons. She says that there used to be two moons in the sky until the second moon wandered too close to the sun and cracked open, spilling a thousand dragons into the world. Her story is dismissed as nonsense by Dany's other handmaidens, Irri and Jhiqui. Daenerys asks Doreah's advice on how to please Khal Drogo in bed and Doreah tutors her in the sensual arts. She also shows Daenerys how to use her sexuality to establish herself as someone worthy of Drogo's respect.\n\nDoreah pleasures Viserys and tells him that she has always wanted to see a dragon. She points out she once saw a man who could change his face like clothing, and a pirate covered in gold who flew colorful sails. Viserys is initially amused by the discussion, but sours when it reminds him of the destruction of his house at the hands of the Usurper. He forces Doreah to finish pleasuring him in silence, which she does unenthusiastically.\n\nDaenerys sends Doreah to invite Viserys for a meal. He takes umbrage with being 'commanded' by a slave and beats Doreah before dragging her through the camp to confront Daenerys. Viserys' temper and inability to control his sister lead him to confront Drogo. Doreah watches as Viserys threatens to kill Daenerys if Drogo does not deliver his promised crown. Drogo feigns acquiescence and then kills Viserys by crowning him with molten gold.\n\nDoreah is part of Daenerys' retinue as she inspects the markets of Vaes Dothrak. She is present when Jorah Mormont foils a wineseller's attempt to poison Daenerys. The narrow escape convinces Drogo to swear that he will invade Westeros for Daenerys. Doreah remains by Daenerys' side as the Khalasar raids Lhazar to obtain slaves to finance the invasion. Daenerys insists the Dothraki refrain from raping their captives and Doreah watches as Drogo easily defeats a dissenting warrior. After Drogo's death, Doreah and the remaining Dothraki watch as Daenerys walks into the flames of his funeral pyre with her dragon eggs. In the morning they find her with three newly-hatched dragons. Doreah and the khalasar kneel and renew their fealty to Daenerys.\n\nDoreah continues to serve as Daenerys' handmaiden as the small remains of the khalasar make their way through the Red Waste. She is fascinated with her dragons, and asks her what Viserys knew of them, only to be told that he knew \"nothing of dragons\". Daenerys' silver horse dies during their journey as a result of thirst and\/or hunger. Daenerys halts the majority of the column and sends her bloodriders to scout ahead.\n\nKovarro returns having reached the city of Qarth. Daenerys leads her people there but is dismayed when she is refused entry by the ruling elders, the Thirteen. The khalasar are eventually admitted, but only after Daenerys threatens to burn the city to the ground once her dragons are grown. They all enter under the protection of Xaro Xhoan Daxos, after invoking sumai.\n\nXaro welcomes Daenerys into his home, giving her people accommodation and buying her gifts. Later, Irri watches as Daenerys and Doreah lean on the stone balcony of their residence. Drogon is perched on the edge of the balcony with a lump of raw meat between them. Daenerys instructs Drogon to breathe flame on the meat by saying Dracarys, the old Valyrian word for Dragon fire. Drogon does as she commands, charring the meat. Doreah and Daenerys watch the dragon gleefully as he feasts on the cooked morsel. Daenerys says that Drogon will be able to feed himself from now on. Doreah reaches for another lump of meat but Daenerys instructs her to let Drogon sleep. Doreah holds out her hand to help the dragon back into his wooden cage and he climbs onto it. Daenerys tells Doreah that the dragon loves her, eliciting a frown from Irri.\n\nDoreah picks up a dress from the bed and asks if Daenerys has seen it. She tells her Xaro had it made for her and reports hearing that he is the wealthiest man in Qarth. Irri concurs with her fellow handmaiden. Doreah adds that Qarth is the richest city in Essos. Daenerys tells Doreah that they know nothing about their host and suggests that men often speak about other men when they are happy, suggesting that Doreah seduce some of Xaro\u2019s fellow citizens to obtain more information. Doreah says that Daenerys would look like a real princess in Xaro\u2019s dress and Irri objects to the title, correcting Doreah that Daenerys is a khaleesi. Irri breaks the ensuing awkward silence by encouraging Daenerys to wear the dress as a guest\u2019s courtesy to Xaro.\n\nXaro throws a reception for Daenerys in his gardens. Doreah and several of the khalasar are also present. Daenerys is pleased to see Doreah ingratiating herself with several of the men present.\n\nWhen they return home later, Daenerys's men have all been brutally murdered, her dragons stolen, Irri lies dead on the floor and Doreah is missing. Daenerys tells Ser Jorah that she believes Doreah is dead.\n\nAfter Daenerys retrieves her dragons from the House of the Undying she finds a sleeping Doreah abed with Xaro, revealing that she had in fact betrayed Daenerys and her dragons to the conspirators. Although she pleads for her life, she is locked inside the merchant prince's vault along with him to die.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Doreah"}}

This leads to Cersei mocking Olenna's infamous tart-tongue. The Queen of Thorns responds in turn calling Cersei \"the famous tart\". Cersei continues to feign ignorance about Loras's arrest. Olenna explains that while she and Tywin didn't like each other, they both understood the need for rivals to work together, particularly given that the Reach is needed to supply most of the capital's food and if that ceases, the smallfolk will not be happy.

As Loras and Margaery are arrested, Olenna looks threateningly at Cersei.","This joy is shattered, however, with the deaths of her son and grandchildren, orchestrated by Cersei. Left as the sole ruler of House Tyrell, Olenna declares war on Cersei, and accepts an invitation to Dorne to meet with Ellaria Sand. Wreathed in black as a sign of mourning and quite clearly struggling to control her emotions at the loss of her beloved family, Olenna listens to Ellaria's offer of an alliance between Dorne and the Reach in the interest of survival. After making her disgust at Ellaria and the Sand Snakes for their action to seize power in Dorne plain, Olenna flatly tells Ellaria that she no longer cares about survival. Ellaria alters her offer to \"vengeance and justice\", and summons someone from the shadows. Olenna turns to see Varys, who clarifies the offer further: \"Fire and Blood\". Some time later, the fleet of the Reach can be seen amongst the rest of Daenerys Targaryen's fleet, as she begins her voyage home to Westeros, though it is not clarified if Lady Olenna is amongst Daenerys' retinue \u2013 she may have remained in the Reach to coordinate the Dragon Queen's arrival.","Realising her death is imminent, Olenna asks Jaime how he plans to kill her, pointing out that he is wielding Joffrey\u2019s sword, Widow's Wail, remarking on the late King\u2019s truly vile nature. Olenna explains to Jaime that any unspeakable wrong she has played a part in was always for the good of House Tyrell, remarking that her true failure was underestimating Cersei\u2019s monstrous imagination, seemingly referring to the destruction of the Sept of Balor. Jaime concedes that while Cersei may currently appear to be monster to others, they will be grateful once she has restored peace to the Seven Kingdoms. Understanding the romantic love Jaime holds for his sister, Olenna pities and tells him Cersei will be his end. Olenna calls Cersei a disease, stating that she regrets her role in spreading it and Jaime will too.","Olenna is still alive by the point the books reached. If the destruction of the Great Sept plays out in the same way, however, Olenna is not necessarily going to have to take control of House Tyrell herself, as she has two additional grandsons, Willas and Garlan. Even if Garlan is killed with Mace and Margaery, Willas rarely leaves Highgarden and would likely work with his grandmother to resist Cersei."],"name":"Olenna Tyrell","description":"Olenna's most prominent traits are her sharp wit, high cunning and intelligence. A politically astute woman, Olenna has been a master of court politics and intrigue her entire life. Olenna's strength and competence in politics has made her the de facto head of House Tyrell and, by extension, the Reach itself. An outspoken woman with little patience for inconvenience, she is unafraid of using her power as head of House Tyrell to threaten her enemies. Olenna never shies from stating her opinion (unless it is more advantageous to mask it) and truly hates Cersei Lannister for her cruelty, incompetence, and deep selfishness. She also admits that she finds Sansa Stark rather dull and is interested in her political potential and not her personality. Olenna stated that she did not trust Tywin Lannister, nor did she especially like him as a person, but she did respect him for his steadfast diligence, ambition and intellect - she almost praised him for the fact that he actually lived up to his reputation. Tywin apparently felt the same way, as Olenna was one of the few people he ever treated as an equal \u2013 notably, when dealing with her, Tywin actually gave her his full attention and even poured her a drink, rather than continuing with his paperwork as he did when almost everyone else \u2013 including his own children \u2013 came to speak with him.\n\nOlenna is incredibly intelligent, as well as wise enough to understand that sometimes people must work with their enemies rather than constantly compete against them, which also explains why she respected Lord Tywin. On the darker side, Olenna has no problem harming children - such as when she poisons Joffrey, leading to his death in his mother's arms - proving she can be just as ruthless as Tywin or Littlefinger when necessary, although not entirely without reason, as she did it in order to protect Margaery from the monster that Joffrey truly was.\n\nShe appears to have a very dark sense of humor and likes to mock those around her, including her own family. Despite this, Olenna clearly loves her family dearly, especially her grand-children. Furthermore, she reveals to her grand-daughter that even though she considered her husband Lord Luthor Tyrell an oaf, she genuinely loved him and struggled to accept his death. Olenna clearly is a staunch supporter of House Tyrell, despite being born and raised a Redwyne (but the Redwynes are also known as strong supporters and loyal bannermen to House Tyrell). In this regard, she is very similar to Tywin Lannister, who also places the power and prestige of his House above all else. Olenna, however, is wise to not be as ruthless or as cold as he was. She strikes a much healthier balance between loyalty to her House and affection for her family than Tywin ever did: whereas all three of his children grew to bitterly resent him, Olenna's grandchildren dote on her, and even her exasperation for Mace's oafishness is affectionate. When she shoots down Mace's attempt to speak to her and Tywin, he doesn't show offense but smiles indulgently, showing that he too dotes on her and is quite content to be under her.\n\nFollowing the death of her family, Olenna's tongue grew even sharper. Instead of showcasing her cunning wit, her jagged barbs now stem from anger and pain. Olenna has not grown reckless or despondent, however: she is ready and willing to seek revenge, and remains strategic and pragmatic about doing so. She also makes it clear that since her entire future has been robbed from her, she doesn't care about survival; she is perfectly willing to die, and exhaust the considerable resources at her disposal, if it means she can bring Cersei to justice. Indeed, when facing death she is perfectly calm and willingly drinks the offered poison after ensuring it won't be painful; before she goes, however, she reveals her part in Joffrey's death and requests that Cersei be told, a last bit of vengeance for and from House Tyrell.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olenna_Tyrell"}}

As per custom, neither Mance's baby or Gilly's baby has a name yet in the novels, but they are given \"milk names\" in the meantime. "],"name":"Gilly","description":"Gilly is one of the many daughters of Craster, a wildling who lives beyond the Wall. She lives with him at Craster's Keep. As well as being a daughter of Craster, she is one of his wives, as Craster routinely marries his own daughters. At the time of the War of the Five Kings, Craster has nineteen wives, including Gilly. When the Night's Watch encounters her, Gilly is pregnant with the incestuous child of her own father.\n\nGilly is named after the gillyflower.\n\nA great ranging of the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont arrives at Craster's Keep. Inside the hall the Lord Commander meets with Craster and Gilly serves wine. During the meeting, Lord Mormont tells Craster that as things are getting dangerous, he and his household can come back with them to Castle Black for protection. Craster pulls Gilly over and instructs her to tell Jeor how content they are: calling him the Lord Crow, the speech she gives seems rehearsed. Gilly says that they are protected by Craster and that it is better to live free than die a slave. Craster is pleased by what she says.\n\nWhile the Night's Watch stay at Craster's Keep, Gilly is scared by Ghost when the white direwolf approaches her, attracted by a dead rabbit she's holding. Samwell Tarly, who had already noticed her, tells Ghost to get away. Gilly notes Sam's courage and asks him to take her away. The two approach Jon Snow, who refuses to take Gilly, reminding the pair of Craster's threat. Gilly is afraid of what might happen to her baby if it's a boy but remains silent when Jon demands to know what Craster does with his male offspring.\n\nJon follows Craster into the woods and sees him leaving a newborn son for the White Walkers. Craster catches him, beats him, and takes him back into the keep. He throws him down at Lord Mormont's feet and demands that the Night's Watch leave his home. Sam spots Gilly carrying out her chores as he is preparing to leave and approaches her. He gives her a thimble that once belonged to his mother. He explains that he used to read to her while she was sewing but that his father ended the practice when he found out. He reveals that the thimble is the only possession he has from his mother and that it was a gift given when he left for the wall. Gilly says that he should not give it away and he explains that he is asking her to keep it safe until he returns for her. She accepts the thimble and the promise.\n\nObsessing over Gilly weeks later while talking to Grenn and Edd, Sam sees the beauty of the icy landscape and announces that Gilly would love it here. The others look at each other and say that there is nothing worse than a man in love. Sam says what interests him about her the most is that despite all that Craster has done to her, Gilly still has hope that life might get better.\n\nThe survivors of the Battle of the Fist of the First Men reach Craster's Keep. While warming on the fire, the loud wails of birthing pains can be heard throughout to Craster's great annoyance. Samwell Tarly leaves the main house to a birthing hut where he witnesses Gilly giving birth. To her horror, the baby is a boy. Sam and Gilly wordlessly realize that Craster will want to sacrifice him to the White Walkers.\n\nSam visits Gilly, who is deeply distraught about the fate of her newborn son. She is frantic, and yells at Sam not to draw attention to the fact that it's a boy by calling it a \"he\" so loud, as Craster will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out it's a son. He asks her if she's decided on a name, but she responds that there's no point in naming her baby if he's only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice. She gives Sam back his mother's thimble and says she doesn't care about such stupid things, all she's focused on is protecting the life of her baby.\n\nWhen the Night's Watch mutiny and kill Craster and Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, Sam rushes to Gilly's hut and orders her that they have to escape now or they never will. Sam runs out of Craster's Keep with Gilly and her baby, as loyal Night's Watch members fall to the mutineers, who also kill or rape Craster's other wives. Gilly leads the way into the night because she knows the woods around her home. Covered in Mormont's blood, Rast shouts into the darkness that \"Piggy\" can run for now, but he'll soon be cutting Sam's throat too.\n\nAfter having fled Craster's Keep Samwell Tarly and Gilly stop to camp during their journey to The Wall. Sam shows Gilly the Dragonglass dagger he found at the Fist of the First Men and tells her about Castle Black.\n\nAfter taking refuge in a destroyed cabin, Sam tries to light a fire, but is unable to, Gilly does it instead. Meanwhile, Sam suggests that Gilly name her son, but she does not know any boy names, Sam gives her some examples, and also explains the difference between first and last names. Suddenly, they are interrupted by the loud squawks of the crows. Sam and Gilly go outside to investigate, and see hundreds of crows angrily squawk at them. Gilly is then horrified to see a White Walker approaching them, and knows that it is after her child. Sam tries to halt its advance, but the Walker shatters his sword with its bare hand and knocks him aside, and heads for Gilly and her baby. Sam staggers back to his feet, pulls out his dragonglass dagger, and attacks the Walker, stabbing it in the back and kills it: shattering the Walker into thousands of ice-like pieces. Sam takes Gilly's arm, and runs as the crows chase after them.\n\nFollowing their encounter with the White Walker, Gilly and Sam continued their journey south to Castle Black. While they were still a considerable distance away from their destination,\n\nSam knew that they were approaching Nightfort, the original headquarters of the Night's Watch which was located between Castle Black and Beyond the Wall. Nightfort had been abandoned centuries ago when the Night's Watch's numbers dwindled. Sam explained to Gilly that he planned to get them across the Wall using a secret sally-port which would lead right into the Nightfort. Gilly expressed her amazement that Sam knew so much history just from reading books, insisting that he is a wizard much to Sam's delight. When they finally caught a glimpse of the wall, which she had never seen before, Gilly was awestruck.\n\nAfter several days of traveling, Gilly and Samwell arrived at the Nightfort. There, she and Samwell encountered Bran Stark, Jon Snow's younger half-brother and his companions\u2014Hodor, Jojen and Meera Reed, and his direwolf Summer\u2014who were travelling north beyond the Wall to find the Three-Eyed Raven. Samwell, noticing the gigantic Hodor and Summer, quickly recognized Bran and offered to take them to Castle Black. But Jojen told Sam and Gilly that he and Bran were travelling beyond the Wall. Due to their earlier encounters with the White Walkers, Samwell and Gilly were unwilling to return to the north. However, Sam reluctantly gave them the obsidian blades which he had found North of the Wall and used to slay the White Walker. While Gilly and Samwell stayed behind in the castle, Bran and company finally reached the Wall.\n\nAfter traveling for some distance, Gilly and Samwell finally arrived at Castle Black. There, they met with Maester Aemon, to whom Gilly announced her baby's name is Sam. Maester Aemon is furious at the prospect that Sam had violated his vows. As a Night's Watch, her friend and protector Sam was not allowed to marry or produce children. In response, Sam defended himself by assuring Aemon that the recently named baby Sam is not his child and begins reciting the Night's Watch oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the Wall they are on and repeating Jeor Mormont's assertion that a wall of ice 500 leagues long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians. Aemon's demeanor softened upon learning that Gilly was one of the late Craster's wives, and acknowledged that she is now a refugee and should be sheltered since the North is no longer safe for humans. Aemon then ordered Sam to begin writing letters immediately and to make sure that all forty-four of Castle Black's ravens are well-fed, as every one of them is to fly that night; the White Walkers have returned, and Westeros must be warned.\n\nThe Night's Watch has given Gilly work by having her assist Hobb in the kitchens. Samwell Tarly fears for her safety, since many members of the Night's Watch are former criminals. Sam has Gilly and her son moved to Mole's Town, a vassal town close to Castle Black. Gilly is given work and a place to stay in a brothel which is frequented by members of the Night's Watch. Sam is resolute in keeping Gilly safe no matter what, but she is unhappy that she had to leave Castle Black and be far away from Sam.\n\nIn Mole's Town, a whore is arguing with Gilly about her baby who woke her up during the night. Gilly, however, is more concerned with the sound of a persistent owl she hears outside. Mole's Town is attacked by a wildling raiding party led by Tormund and Styr. The entire town is massacred, but Gilly and her son are saved when Ygritte discovers them and urges them to keep quiet and remain in hiding. Gilly and her son manage to return to Castle Black. A relunctant Pypar opens the gate for her and she is greeted by Sam, who is overjoyed to see her. Sam promises that he won't leave her again like he did in Mole's Town. Suddenly, two horn blasts are heard from the top of the Wall, meaning the fighting is about to start. Sam decided to have Gilly and her son hide in a storage room. However, Gilly is distraught when she learns that Sam will be leaving to fight in the upcoming battle. Gilly wants Sam to stay with her as he promised, but he cannot as he sworn to defend the Wall as a brother of the Night's Watch. Before he leaves her, Gilly begs Sam to promise her that he won't die and the two finally share a kiss. Later, she is discovered by Janos Slynt, who has fled the fighting in fear. Sam is later reunited with Gilly after the wildling attack has been repelled.\n\nGilly continues to help the Night's Watch by mending clothes in the courtyard of Castle Black. She tells Sam that she is aware of Ser Alliser Thorne's hatred of her since she is a wildling and is worried about being sent away. Sam comforts her by reaffirming his promise that wherever she goes, he will go too in order to protect her. However, Gilly argues that he cannot leave Castle Black to go with her or he would be executed for breaking his vows. Later, Gilly is present when Mance Rayder is executed by Stannis Baratheon for refusing to bend the knee. Horrified by seeing someone executed in such a brutal manner, Gilly turns away before Mance is consumed by the flames.\n\nBeing illiterate, Gilly has begun to learn letters from Princess Shireen Baratheon, with Samwell watching over the two. Gilly also reveals to Shireen that she had sisters that also had Greyscale, but they were quarantined away from the other women at Craster's Keep and eventually succumbed to the disease.\n\nOn his deathbed, Maester Aemon fondly interacts with Little Sam, recalling that his younger brother Egg had a jolly laugh just like him when he was a baby. His strength failing, he also warns Gilly that she must go south with her baby before it is too late. Winter is almost upon them and the White Walkers will come with it to attack the Wall.\n\nAfter Stannis's departure, Gilly, being the only girl left at The Wall, is targeted by a few men of the Night's Watch. While getting supplies for her baby, two corner her and attempt to rape her, but Sam intervenes, ending with him getting beaten up. When they try to go at her, again, Ghost appears and scares them away. Afterwards, Gilly begins treating Sam's wounds but it quickly turns into them having sex.\n\nLater, when Jon returns, Sam asks him if he can travel to Oldtown to study and replace Aemon as the new maester for Castle Black, as he feels there is no other way he can help them as he cannot fight. He also wishes to take Gilly and little Sam with him, in order to protect them from the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon allows this and Sam, Gilly and the baby depart shortly after.\n\nGilly and her baby Sam accompany Samwell Tarly on a voyage to Oldtown. Gilly assures Samwell that the voyage will be over soon and that she can't wait to see Oldtown, which the Captain has described as the most beautiful town in Westeros. While Sam had originally planned to go and study at the Citadel, he changes his mind because the Citadel does not admit women and children within its walls. Unwilling to abandon Gilly and Sam on the streets, Sam decides to take them to his ancestral home of Horn Hill and claim they are his spouse and child. Though Sam does not get on well with his father Randyll Tarly, he reassures her that his mother and sister are nice. Despite her unease, she lets Samwell decide what is best for her and her child.\n\nAfter landing in Oldtown, Gilly, Samwell, and Sam travel by station coach to Horn Hill. To protect Gilly from his Wildling-hating father Randyll, Samwell tells his father's retainers that Gilly is a Northern woman he had bedded in Mole's Town and that Sam is their son. Upon arriving at Horn Hill, they are greeted by Samwell's mother Melessa and sister Talla Tarly, who take a liking to Gilly and her baby. Talla offers to lend Gilly one of her dresses. Gilly bathes and changes from her rough, woolen northern dress into a fine southern dress.\n\nShe meets Sam's father Randyll and brother Dickon Tarly at dinner. During the dinner, Randyll mocks his son's fighting and hunting skills. Gilly springs to Sam's defense by telling Randyll that Samwell had killed a Thenn and a White Walker in combat. Instead of hearing her message about Samwell's valor, all Randyll hears is that her tale reveals the fact that Gilly is a Wildling. Randyll berates Samwell for falling to the wiles of a Wildling, a choice far worse than the Molestown whore that he had assumed Gilly to be. Randyll's bigoted remarks anger Melessa, who springs to Gilly's defense by telling Randyll that he dishonors himself. Melessa and Talla leave the dinner table in protest and ask Gilly to come with them. Later, Randyll allows Gilly and her son to stay at Horn Hill. He promises to raise Sam as his grandson but tells Samwell that he must leave at dawn.\n\nIn their chambers, Sam apologizes to Gilly for not standing up to his father and tells her that he will be leaving at first light. Gilly tells him that he should not be apologizing for his father's actions. Later, Samwell decides to steal the family heirloom, a Valyrian steel sword named Heartsbane, and tells Gilly to pack up their belongings and bring baby Sam. Gilly responds that she has no other belongings to carry save his sister's dress. Samwell responds that it looks better on her. The three then flee into the night.\n\nAfter arriving in Oldtown, Sam and Gilly meet a Citadel maester. Sam gives him a letter from Lord Commander Snow about Sam becoming a maester for the Night's Watch, but the maester is skeptical about Jon Snow's state, saying that no word was given about Lord Commander Mormont's death from Maester Aemon. The maester states that Sam's situation is \"irregular,\" to which Sam responds, \"Life is irregular.\" The maester then says that Sam must speak to the Archmaester in order to discuss these issues. The maester then allows Sam to use the library, but blocks Gilly and Little Sam from entering, who are left behind.\n\nGilly and Sam get to stay with Samwell Tarly while he studies and serves at the Citadel. While Sam is reading about the Long Night, she plays with Sam, who is now a toddler. When Gilly questions him about the book he is studying, Samwell confides that a cache of dragonglass is hidden beneath the castle of Dragonstone and that he needs to tell Jon Snow.\n\nGilly and a frustrated Samwell read together. Gilly reads the journal of High Septon Maynard, who recorded every little detail of his life and knowledge, proudly reading aloud the facts he knew, such as the amount of steps in the Citadel and the number of windows at the Great Sept of Baelor. While reading the journal, she discovers that \"Prince Ragger\" had his marriage annulled by Maynard so that he could remarry at a secret ceremony in Dorne. Samwell pays no matter to her discovery, however, overcome by his frustration over the arrogance of the Maesters. He makes the difficult decision of abandoning the Order of Maesters and departs Oldtown with Gilly and Little Sam, taking with him dozens of forbidden books.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Gilly"}}

He died moments before the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor as a result of a plot orchestrated by Qyburn, a former maester himself, who had his little birds stab Pycelle to death.","Pycelle has been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms for decades and has served under four kings when the series begins. The Grand Maester is the King's personal maester, a learned man wise in history, science and medicine who also provides counsel. The Grand Maester sits on the King's small council, which runs the realm in the name of the King. He served King Aerys II Targaryen prior to Robert's Rebellion. He remembers Aerys as a great man before his descent into madness. When Tywin Lannister marched to the gates of King's Landing following the rebel victory at the Battle of the Trident and all of the King's advisors told Aerys not to trust the Lord of Casterly Rock, Pycelle gave the opposite counsel and the city gates were opened, allowing the Lannister forces to sack the capital.","Pycelle is in court when Eddard dispatches Lord Beric Dondarrion to bring Ser Gregor Clegane to justice for his looting in the Riverlands. Stark also sends word to Casterly Rock, demanding that Lord Tywin Lannister explain his bannerman's actions. Littlefinger and Pycelle object, but Eddard insists on seeking justice.","Pycelle reports a raven from Castle Black and gives its message to Tyrion. Varys interjects that the wildlings are becoming increasingly troublesome. Petyr is sarcastically dismissive. Varys goes on to say that the wildlings are organizing behind the King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder. Cersei jokes that she has lost track of the number of kings. Tyrion says that the message is from Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and that he is asking for more men. Cersei says that they cannot spare any because they are fighting their own war. Tyrion reads a troublesome passage: \"the cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.\" Pycelle dismisses it as Northern superstition and Cersei makes to leave. Tyrion relays Jeor's encounter with a wight and asserts his reliability. Varys wonders how you kill a dead man and Tyrion reports that Jeor burned the wights. Cersei mocks Tyrion as having become gullible, believing in \"grumpkins and snarks\" after one trip to the Wall. He says that he is not sure what he believes but reminds Cersei that the Night's Watch is the only thing that separates them from what lies beyond the Wall. Cersei sarcastically claims that she has every confidence in the brave men of the Night's Watch.","The reinstated Pycelle attends a meeting of the small council, now held at the Tower of the Hand. Lord Tywin tasks Petyr Baelish - recently made Lord of Harrenhal - with offering a marriage proposal to the widow Lysa Arryn. Pycelle adds that such a marriage would make Petyr Acting Lord of the Vale. After Tyrion notes that Petyr's departure would leave the crown without its Master of Coin just when a royal wedding is at hand, Tywin informs his son he will become the new Master of Coin - a \"demotion\" considering Tyrion's previous post as Acting Hand of the King. Pycelle heartily and mockingly supports the Hand of the King's decision.","Pycelle is present during Tyrion's trial by combat, and begins delivering an opening speech until Tywin demonstrates his annoyance at Pycelle's verbosity by cuing the horn player to sound out a blast signaling the beginning of the showdown and prematurely cutting Pycelle off, humiliating him and forcing him to shuffle off in silence.","At Tywin Lannister's wake, Pycelle offers his condolences to Cersei, who completely ignores him.","The new Hand of the King Kevan Lannister was conducting a meeting of the Small Council along with Lady Olenna, when Pycelle starts rambling about Qyburn's work on restoring the Mountain as an abomination (referring to him as \"the beast\") when Cersei and Jaime walk into the room opting to join the proceedings, followed by Ser Gregor himself. After Kevan states his objection to the two of them being there, Jaime counters by saying he has a seat on the council as the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Cersei then orders the Grand Maester to vouch for her brother's presence which he reluctantly does so; stating a precedent existed due to Ser Gerold Hightower being on the council in the same position under the Mad King. When Pycelle began to object to Jaime's presence afterwards, the Lord Commander interrupted him by bringing a chair to his side of the table and slammed it down. Kevan, Mace and Olenna quickly leave the hall, whereas Pycelle cowers past Ser Gregor who ominously looks back at the Grand Maester.","Cersei grows impatient with Pycelle's conduct, and regrets that she had him released from prison. She thinks he has outlived any usefulness he ever had, and considers replacing him."],"name":"Pycelle","description":"Pycelle is regarded as a cowardly, subservient and extremely sycophantic man by most people, and it is proven that he is so. He is potentially joint in responsibility for the Sacking of King's Landing, as he persuaded the Mad King to open the gates to the capital and allow the Lannister forces to enter and rampage through the city. Pycelle remembers several other rulers, and even remarks to have known Aerys Targaryen before the latter became a psychopathic pyromaniac. Pycelle is viewed by Jaime Lannister as 'a grey, sunken cunt' meaning that he is unpopular amongst most people. This is ironic, because he secretly serves the Lannister House throughout most of the series - specifically, Tywin and Cersei Lannister.\n\nHe does not appear to have a strong relationship with the other Lannisters, as he is joined in hating and discriminating Tyrion for his disfigurement and short stature. Despite preaching and claiming to be a man of virtue, Pycelle intentionally usurps and flouts the vow of celibacy by employing prostitutes. Pycelle, despite his extremely frail and absent-minded outlook, is (in his own way) dangerous and surprisingly intelligent and agile, possessing a certain low cunning that other people overlook. He is also firmly opinionated, (rightly) believing that Qyburn's methods are highly unethical, and refers to the latter in diabolical terms. Pycelle is capable of arrogance and cowardice, shown by him desperately blaming Varys when Tyrion accuses him of betraying him to Cersei.\n\nIn public, he appears to be clumsy, senile and possessing a constant stammer. When in private, or in the presence of the likes of Tywin Lannister, Pycelle shows that he is actually feigning the stammer in an attempt of being unpredictable. He admits to Tywin that he is ambitious and simply wants to outlast his opponents. However, he is not above being a hypocritical coward, claiming that he serves the Lannisters when he did not hesitate in prosecuting Tyrion. He took the latter incident on an unnecessarily personal level, voicing his belief that his previous arrest by the Imp was unjustified - when, in actuality, it wasn't.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Pycelle"}}

Daenerys names him Rhaego for her deceased brother, Rhaegar. Later, during a feast to celebrate, Viserys threatens to kill both Daenerys and Rhaego unless Drogo upholds his end of their bargain, to assist him in reclaiming the Iron Throne. This prompts Drogo to kill Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head. Daenerys and her unborn son are later nearly killed by an assassin sent by Robert Baratheon, although they are saved just in time by Ser Jorah's intervention. Upon learning of the attempt on the life of his wife and unborn son, Drogo declares to invade Westeros and take back the Seven Kingdoms for Rhaego.\n\nOn the borders of Lhazar, close to the Red Waste, a heavily pregnant Daenerys has Mirri Maz Duur perform a blood magic ritual to save Drogo from an infected wound. Whilst the ritual is taking place, Drogo's bloodriders object to the ritual and one of them, Qotho, knocks Daenerys to the ground when she tries to stop him from intervening, causing her to go into premature labour. Desperate to help her, Ser Jorah brings Daenerys into the tent where Mirri is conducting the ritual, despite her orders not to let anyone enter. Rhaego is reportedly stillborn and comes out looking like a monster. Mirri Maz Duur claims that he had scales like a lizard, was blind with bat-like wings, and had innards full of graveworms. She also says that when she touched him, his skin fell away from his bones, and that it was his death that paid for Drogo's life.\n\nAfter Pyat Pree tells Daenerys that her stolen dragons are in the possession of the warlocks of Qarth, in the House of the Undying, she goes there to recover them. There, she sees different visions, including one of a Dothraki Khal's tent in a snow storm, north of the Wall.

This might indicate that Malleon lived more recently, but this could easily be explained as simply that other Maesters continued to update the book after Malleon died. What adds further weight to the later explanation is that there is no way Malleon could have known of Joffrey's birth, given that Pycelle was already Grand Maester during the Mad King's reign, but Joffrey was only born after the Mad King died in the rebellion.

The Reeds and their vassals are Crannogmen, a distinct off-shoot of the First Men who have adapted to living in the swamps of the Neck.","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the crannogmen of the Neck are gifted and talented hunters and warriors. They have an ages-old feud with House Frey, who rule the lands immediately to the south. The Reeds came to the attention of their liege lords, House Stark, when Howland Reed met Eddard Stark at a tournament at Harrenhal. Howland Reed and Eddard Stark became fast friends and allies. Aside from Eddard, Howland was the only survivor of the raid at the Tower of Joy, on the occasion of Lyanna Stark's death. The Reed stronghold at Greywater Watch is hard to find because it supposedly moves around on a floating island."],"name":"House Reed","description":"Before the War of the Five Kings began, Howland Reed, the current head of House Reed and Lord of Greywater Watch, fought alongside his liege-lord Eddard Stark in Robert's Rebellion and saved his life during one of its final skirmishes at the Tower of Joy.\n\nSeveral years later after the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings, Howland's children, Jojen and Meera, travel north to find Bran Stark and guide him in his quest to find the three-eyed raven alongside Hodor, Osha, Rickon Stark, and their two direwolves, Summer and Shaggydog. Eventually, Bran decides to send Rickon to Last Hearth along with Osha and Shaggydog. Before they depart, Osha tells the Reeds to keep Bran safe.\n\nThe Reeds continue traveling Beyond the Wall with Bran, Hodor and Summer. While resting near Craster's Keep, they are monentarily distracted by the cries of Craster's last son and Ghost, leading to their capture by Karl Tanner and his fellow Mutineers. When Karl prepares to rape his sister, Jojen tells him that he possesses the sight and sardonically reveals that he saw Karl die in a vision, causing Karl to turn his attention to him just before Jon Snow arrives with a group of black brothers to kill all the Mutineers. Locke, who really serves Roose Bolton, attempts to flee with Bran as he was also tasked with finding Rickon. Jojen signals Bran to warg into Hodor and save his own body through Hodor's, which he does by snapping Locke's neck. Bran orders Hodor to free the Reeds and attempts to call out to his half-brother Jon. However, Jojen dissuades Bran from doing this saying that Jon will not allow him to find the three-eyed raven. Bran reluctantly agrees not to reunite with Jon and continue the quest.\n\nEventually, the group makes their way to the cave of the three-eyed raven, but they are ambushed by wights. Jojen is stabbed multiple times by wights, prompting his sister to cut his throat in order to prevent him from becoming one himself.\n\nMeera mourns the death of her brother at the hands of the wights. She expresses her doubts to Bran, stating that she believes they are doing nothing at the cave. Leaf later tells Meera that Bran needs her.\n\nDuring one of his visions, Bran witnesses the events of the Showdown at the Tower of Joy alongside the three-eyed raven. Bran's father, Eddard Stark, leads a group of five other Northmen, including the crannogman Howland Reed, to the Tower of Joy in the Red Mountains of Dorne. After a brief banter, the Northerners attack Ser Gerold Hightower and Ser Arthur Dayne, the last of the Kingsguard to Aerys II Targaryen. Howland is the first to fall from Arthur Dayne's sword. The skirmish eventually culminates into a one-on-one duel between Ned and Arthur. Going in for a strike, Ned is instead disarmed by the Sword of the Morning. However, before Arthur can attack Ned, he is stabbed in the back of the neck by Howland, whose wound is not fatal. Bran is shocked by this dishonorable act and surprised his father condoned it. Ned then picks up Dawn, the ancestral sword of House Dayne, and finishes off Arthur Dayne.\n\nAfter being touched by the Night King in a vision, the cave of the three-eyed raven is attacked by the Night King, three other White Walkers, and their army of the dead. Meera urges Bran to warg into Hodor, which completes a time loop that causes the Hodor in the past to collapse and seizure. Meera commands the present day Hodor to \"hold the door,\" causing the Hodor in the past to begin to seizure and slur the command into Hodor. Hodor holds the door, preventing the wights from exiting the cave and buying enough time for Meera and Bran to escape.\n\nMeera collapses from exhaustion and apologizes to Bran for failing to protect him as the wights gain on the two. In the nick of time, they are rescued by a mysterious figure clad in black. The individual later reveals himself to be Benjen Stark, Bran's long lost uncle and the former First Ranger of the Night's Watch. Benjen tells the two that the three-eyed raven now \"lives through\" Bran, and says that Bran will be instrumental in stopping the Night King.\n\nBenjen drops Meera and Bran off at the Wall, informing them that ancient magic carved into it prevents him from crossing. He warns them that the \"Great War\" is upon them, and says that he continues to fight for the living. He wishes them good fortune before riding off. Bran crawls to a weirwood tree with Meera's help. Before he makes contact, Meera asks if he's ready, to which he replies that he is now the three-eyed raven and that he has to be. In that vision, Bran witnesses the birth of Jon Snow and the revelation that he is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, a piece of knowledge that is most likely known by only one other living man: Howland Reed.\n\nMeera and Bran reach the gate to Castle Black at the Wall, where Lord Commander Eddison Tollett questions if they are wildlings. Meera replies that she is the daughter of Howland Reed and that her companion is Brandon Stark, son of Eddard Stark. Edd doubts it initially, but Bran says that he has seen Edd at the Fist of the First Men and Home, and that they need to come together to face the Night King and the return of the Long Night. Edd lets them through. Meera and Bran eventually make it to Winterfell, where Bran reunites with his sister Sansa Stark, the new Lady of Winterfell.\n\nAfter Bran receives the Valyrian steel Catspaw dagger from Petyr Baelish, Meera says farewell to Bran in his chambers, stating that she needs to be with her family in Greywater Watch when the White Walkers and the army of the dead come. Bran, who has been psychologically traumatized through his experiences with greensight, merely thanks Meera for keeping him safe and alive. Bran tells her that he isn't Bran Stark anymore, but is now the three-eyed raven. A tearful Meera tells Bran that he died in the cave and leaves to depart to the Neck.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/House_Reed"}}

He confronts Balon on a rope bridge between two of Pyke's towers, as it is buffeted by the wind and rain. Balon says he assumed Euron would be dead by now, rotting under some foreign sea. Euron sarcastically replies with the traditional Ironborn words, \"what is dead may never die\", and chides Balon when he doesn't repeat the phrase. Balon accuses him of mocking the Drowned God, which Euron retorts by boasting that he is the Drowned God: for from Oldtown to Qarth, whenever men see his sails they pray. The strong wind batters the bridge, making Balon have to hold onto the support ropes, but with eerie calmness Euron stands perfectly still with his hands together in front of him, unafraid. Smirking, Euron notes that his brother is old, and says it is time for him to move aside and let another rule.","Having failed to meet Daenerys, Euron sails the Iron Fleet to King's Landing, answering the invitation of Cersei Lannister, the new Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Cersei proposes an allegiance between the crown and the Ironborn, which Euron counters with an offer of marriage. Cersei declines Euron's attempt at courtship, and he departs, promising to return with a gift that will win her heart. Seeking out his promised gift for Cersei, Euron intercepts and attacks Yara's fleet, which had departed from Dragonstone and was sailing to Dorne to consolidate the Dornish armies and fleet. The Silence locks onto Black Wind with a corvus, and Euron's men board and attack Yara's and Theon's.  During the ensuing battle, despite taking several wounds Euron kills Obara Sand by first disarming her, snapping her spear in half and then impaling her with the broken pieces and her sister Nymeria Sand by strangling her with her own whip. Soon afterwards, he engages in a melee with his niece and beats her, holding her at her throat with his axe. He calls for his nephew, mocking him as \"little Theon\" and as a \"cockless coward,\" and implores that he come rescue her. However, Theon instead jumps overboard, leaping into the sea, which Euron sadistically laughs at. Euron then nails the body of Obara to the front of the ship and hangs Nymeria's body from the bowsprit. Theon holds onto a plank in Blackwater Bay, watching on as the Silence and the rest of Euron's fleet sail away while his sister's fleet burns and sinks to the bottom of the Blackwater.","Only one ironborn sees through Euron's cunning - Rodrik \"the Reader\" Harlaw. He warns Victarion and other ironborn that they have gained very little except the Tyrells' enmity, and soon they will retake the Shield Islands, but Victarion (and almost everyone else) do not listen to him. "],"name":"Euron Greyjoy","description":"Euron is a wildly unpredictable and cruel man even among the Ironborn, and is widely regarded as the most feared pirate alive, who has become the terror of the world's oceans from Oldtown to the Jade Sea. Even many of the other ironborn greatly fear Euron, and consider him to be half-insane - not in the sense of being impulsive, but in that he seems almost delusional, with an utterly fearless, warped personality. Unlike other psychotic characters of the series, Euron is not prone to outbursts of anger or impulsive violence; everything he does seems to be for some sort of calculated purpose, though others might not be able to perceive it - such as calmly ripping out the tongues of his entire crew for no other reason than \"I needed silence\". Euron possesses an unnerving coyness to him, tranquil and detached in the face of danger and mildly playful (but never indulgent in idle whims). When walking along the rope-bridges of Pyke during a massive storm, while Balon struggled not to fall over, Euron calmly stood his ground without bothering to hold on to anything. Euron also isn't particularly arrogant, in the sense that he doesn't have a sense of entitlement - he just does what he feels like, and is self-assured in his own power and abilities.\n\nIn contrast, Joffrey Baratheon was an arrogant, petty fool prone to random outbursts of anger, obsessed with the title of king he believed he inherited, even though he was little more than a puppet backed up by his grandfather Tywin. Joffrey never actually wielded a weapon, however, usually making a cowardly retreat when confronted with real danger. Ramsay Bolton was sadistic and personally dangerous, capable of great violence and torment against people he had already captured, but he didn't have any true authority to back it up, and an impulsive, childish need to brutalize people for transient amusement (i.e. hunting women for sport and flaying men alive who disobeyed him, then leaving them on public display) with no thought to the long-term repercussions. Ramsay only knew random force and was in no way skilled at diplomacy, alienating potential allies. Euron Greyjoy, meanwhile, isn't impulsive but capable of cunning long-term strategies, and unlike both of them, is actually capable of being extremely charming when the situation arises. Euron needed to win over the ironborn to elect him king willingly, playing to their admiration for strength and audacity, while making grandiose promises. In many ways, Euron is the feared ruler that Joffrey and Ramsay wished they could be: genuinely dangerous and cunning, with a well-earned reputation, the authority to back it up, and a gift for long-term manipulation.\n\nEuron's true personality, however, is in some ways difficult to pin down - he is such a master manipulator that he tailors each performance, as it were, to fit his current audience. When he wins over the ironborn at the Kingsmoot, he shifts to a more low-brow register, playing to their love of battle and crass sex jokes. When he appears before Queen Cersei, however, he shifts to a different act of a swaggering and dangerous but very witty and charming persona. His private confrontation with his brother Balon may have been one of the few times he dropped the mask and the man underneath appeared: dark and threatening, making a few bitter quips, but with an unnerving sense of tranquility while making blasphemous claims about his own power, likening himself to a god, and to the storm itself.\n\nEuron is a terrifying and relentless warrior in personal combat if the need arises, laughing while shrugging off minor stab wounds. He is a master combatant, individually killing two of the Sand Snakes and capturing his niece; all of whom were deadly warriors in their own right.\n\nAdditionally, Euron is a master sailor, admiral, and genius in navel combat. His talent in navel warfare led to much of Cersei's early advantages in her war: destroying the rival Greyjoy fleet, crushing the Dornish forces and blockading the Unsullied in Casterly Rock. With his powerful navy and brillence, Euron may well be the greatest navel power in the world.\n\nEuron also has no qualms with other social taboos such as kinslaying, openly killing his own brother to seize the throne and bragging about that in public, and flippantly announcing he will murder his niece and nephew. In that aspect, Euron proves to be worse than Ramsay: Ramsay has also killed his kin, but even he wouldn't admit that in public.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Euron_Greyjoy"}}

Black Walder further demands that Edmure Tully be engaged to one of Lord Walder Freys's daughters, with the pair to be married within the fortnight due to the fact that Lord Walder had become wary of long engagements after his recent experience with Robb Stark.

Catelyn lets out a wail of tears and remains silent for a moment, before Black Walder steps behind her and cuts her throat and walks away as the blood spews out of her.\n\nBlack Walder and Lothar inform their father of the capture of Riverrun by Ser Brynden Tully. When Lord Walder berates them for allowing the Blackfish to escape in the first place, Black Walder begins to protest but his father cuts him off and demands they take back Riverrun. They argue that, since House Mallister and House Blackwood are supporting Brynden, and Riverrun is built to withstand sieges, retaking the castle would be impossible. Walder tells his bastard to take Riverrun by showing Brynden the knife he used to cut Catelyn's throat, and by using the captive Edmure as a bartering piece.\n\nBlack Walder and Lothar siege Riverrun as commanded, but do a poor job of it. They do not fortify their boundaries, allow the Lannister army to enter unnoticed, and do not even dig trenches. To try and force Brynden to surrender, Walder stands on a scaffold with Edmure and threatens to hang him. When this fails, he threatens to cut his throat as he did to Catelyn. Brynden calls his bluff, knowing that Edmure is too valuable to kill, and the siege continues. Ser Jaime Lannister arrives to take over from the Freys, but is immediately challenged by Walder.

They were the leading body of Aegon II's faction, known as \"The Greens\". In response, Rhaenyra established her own rival Small Council, known as the \"Black Council\"."],"name":"Green Council","description":"The Green Council was mostly formed of the members of King Viserys I's Small Council at the time of his death - which had come to be dominated by the Greens, the court faction of Viserys I's second wife, Queen Alicent Hightower. Of the seven men on that Small Council, only one was still openly loyal to Rhaenyra: Lyman Beesbury, the old Master of Coin who had served at court for many years and was determined to honor Viserys I's direct orders that Rhaenyra would succeed him to the throne. At the emergency Small Council meeting called upon Viserys I's death in his sleep, Beesbury alone refused to acquiesce to Aegon II usurping the throne - upon which Criston Cole promptly snuck up behind him and slit his throat. As Beesbury's warm blood still pooled across the table, the \"Green council\" was formed of the remaining six members, plus Queen Alicent as an advisor.\n\nAegon II's Small Council were his own immediate advisors at court, not necessarily all of the major leaders of \"the Greens\" during the civil war, i.e. Borros Baratheon wasn't a member of the council but continued to rule at Storm's End while contributing House Baratheon's armies to the war.\n\nAt the outset of the Dance:\n\nnull\n\nAfter the Blacks captured Harrenhal and Rhaenyra's assassins killed Aegon II's eldest son and heir, he grew impatient with his grandfather Otto's diplomatic maneuverings. Aegon II therefore ripped the chain of office from Otto's neck and replaced him as Hand of the King with Criston Cole himself.\n\nCole and Aegon II then marched to attack Black castles in the Crownlands, where at the Battle of Rook's Rest Aegon II was left crippled and heavily medicated into unconsciousness. Aegon II's younger brother Aemond Targaryen then served as Regent, joining Cole and the main Green army from King's Landing in a march north to Harrenhal. This turned out to be a trick to lure the capital city's defenders away, however, and Rhaenyra's forces from Dragonstone in the east quickly captured King's Landing. Aemond and Cole later died in battle, while the other members of the Green council were captured - but Aegon II escaped.\n\nTyland Lannister was originally Master of Ships at the time that Viserys I died; he was made the new Master of Coin to replace the murdered Lyman Beesbury. The Green council planned to offer the now-vacant position of Master of Ships to Lord Dalton Greyjoy of the Iron Islands to woo him into joining their side in the war. Dalton, however, didn't see much profit in sailing all the way around Westeros to raid Dragonstone and the Vale, while the wealth of Oldtown and Lannisport was both closer and more vulnerable on the western coasts, so he sided with the Blacks.\n\nIt is stated that as a result, the Blacks always had the advantage at sea during the civil war, possessing the Royal Fleet and Velaryon fleets in the east and the Iron Fleet in the west. The Greens did have the Redwyne fleet but it was reduced to a defensive posture around Oldtown against the ironborn. Ultimately the Greens had to ally with the Free Cities that hated Daemon to field any fleet against the Blacks. Given that the Greens never really controlled a significant number of ships, they apparently never bothered to appoint a new Master of Ships.\n\nUltimately, after Rhaenyra captured King's Landing she had Otto Hightower and Ironrod executed for treason, but kept Queen Mother Alicent alive and imprisoned. Criston Cole died soon afterwards in battle at the Butcher's Ball.\n\nTyland Lannister was also captured, but was kept alive - because he knew where the old royal treasury had been hidden, and the Blacks wanted to torture the information out of him. Tyland was blinded, gelded, and mutilated, but survived and was later freed when Aegon II retook the city about seven months later. Despite his grievous injuries he surprisingly turned out to still be an effective advisor and was restored to his position as Master of Coin. Grand Maester Orwyle was also taken prisoner, but his life was spared - for some time, at least. He wrote a major account of the war while in his cell, trying to make it slanted in Rhaenyra's favor so they would spare his life, and this was a major basis for Munkun's history of the Dance. It is unclear what ultimately happened to him. Larys Strong, meanwhile, escaped the city along with the then-comatose Aegon II and remained his greatest advisor up until the very end of the war.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Green_Council"}}

His youth has been pleasant and shielded from responsibility - but recently Ryon's innocence has begun to fade. When the war began, Ryon was too young to understand why Rodrik and his father were leaving home. But the grim realities of a House at war have been impossible to avoid and Ryon now asks questions for which his siblings have no answers.\n\nRyon first appears in the forest just outside Ironrath playing hide and seek with his newly appointed lord brother Ethan Forrester and his sister Talia. Ryon cannot find Ethan and gets scared, having just lost his father and eldest brother, he fears he will lose Ethan too.\n\nLater, at Ironrath, Ryon is seen carving a wooden sword, which one day he hopes will be a real sword so he can kill the people who destroyed his family. Etched into the sword are the names of two of his brothers, Ethan, for strength, and Rodrik, to remember him. He names the sword Two Brothers. Ethan notices the lack of his other brother's name, Asher.\n\nRyon is present when Ramsay Snow is invited into the hall at Ironrath and is shown to be very scared of Ramsay, hiding behind his mother. After Ramsay murders Ethan, he orders that Ryon become a ward of House Whitehill, effectively making the new heir a hostage.\n\nRyon remains a ward at Highpoint until his father and brother Ethan's funeral. Rodrik either decides to submit to Lord Whitehill and kiss his ring in order to allow Ryon to attend, or refuses to be cowed by the rival lord. If Rodrik submits, Ryon attends the funeral with an escort of four Whitehill soldiers. Ryon begs his brother to return him to Ironrath, and Rodrik promises that his family will not forget him. If Rodrik stands up to Lord Whitehill, Ryon is instead kept at Highpoint during the funeral. However, Gwyn Whitehill is sent in his place and assures Rodrik that he is fine, but scared, as Ludd Whitehill tells him daily that his family has forgotten him and that his father and brother died because they were traitors and cowards. Rodrik asks Gwyn to ensure he does not believe the lies told to him by Lord Whitehill.\n\nRyon does not appear in this episode, but Malcolm Branfield mentions to Asher that everyday they lose is a day Ryon and Talia could be harmed.\n\nLater, one of the choices is choosing to attempt to save Ryon or exile Gryff as one of the plans for House Forrester to follow.\n\nIf Rodrik beats Gryff, Lady Forrester will mention what Ludd would do to Ryon when he finds out what happened to Gryff as she attempts to stop Rodrik.\n\nRodrik, Royland or Duncan, along with his mother and optionally the Glenmore soldiers are invited to Highpoint. After discussing business with Lord Whitehill, Rodrik inquires about Ryon. He also reveals that he has had Gryff and the garrison imprisoned and will glady trade Ryon for Gryff. At this point Lord Whitehill distraught after learning his son has been kidnapped, he orders Ryon to be brought out of his dungeon and begins to threaten them by grabbing a table essential to Ryon's face, stating he will kill Ryon. Rodrik diffuses the situation, and secures the trade, however he isn't freed in this episode as Lord Whitehill refuses to do it anywhere except on neutral ground.\n\nIn the event that Rodrik was saved after the Ambush at the Harbor, Ryon appears prior to the Battle of Ironrath, where he is accompanied by House Whitehill's army and is forced by Lord Whitehill to reveal a \"gift\" to House Forrester. Much to the horror of Beskha and rest of House Forrester, Ryon wields a spear with Asher's head on the end of it. But as the battle wages on, Rodrik, Beskha, and the pit fighters sneak into the Whitehill camp, where they find Lord Whitehill and Gryff conversing about Ryon, where Gryff intends to sever his legs off so he cannot escape, prompting the player to decide to whether kill Lord Whitehill at the cost of Ryon's life or Gryff to save Ryon. In the event that Gryff is selected, Beskha rescues Ryon and escapes the camp. If Lord Whitehill was the intended target, he taunts Rodrik and claims that Ryon was already dead because he gave orders to Gryff to kill him in the event he was killed. Regardless of whom was killed, Ryon appears in the epilogue (with a cut on his cheek if Rodrik killed Ludd) and is seen escorted by Beskha on horseback.\n\nIf Asher survived the ambush, Ryon is seen outside Ironrath with the Whitehill army while Ludd proposes a truce to the other Forresters. When Ludd sends a cart carrying Rodrik's body into Ironrath, Ryon demands to see his brother. Later when the Forresters invite the Whitehills into Ironrath with the intent of tricking them and killing Ludd, Ryon is taken into the Great Hall with the Whitehill family and briefly reunited with the other Forresters, then moved to the other end of the room. Beskha, on Asher's request, seats herself opposite Ryon and protects him from the Whitehill soldiers when the Forresters plan is executed. It is presumed she escorts him safely out of Ironrath while the battle is taken place. Ryon is last seen in the epilogue on a horse with Beskha.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ryon_Forrester"}}

Degore had a natural grasp of military tactics and strategy. As the story goes, Degore led a nighttime raid on Sea Dragon Point, where he cut the moorings of a dozen Greyjoy longships and burned the drifting ships to ash - along with all the Ironborn on board. Degore was given charge of a battalion and came to play a crucial role in the Siege of Pyke that ended the war. In the months that followed, King Robert awarded Royland a knighthood and Lord Forrester asked him to serve as Ironrath\u2019s Master-at-Arms. Ser Royland still holds the position and is known for his military expertise\u2026 as well as his legendary temper.","While asking people who should be Sentinel, Royland is training his men.

Royland believes the man has found some random corpses and dressed them in Forrester colors so sends him away, knowing the driver, Fegg once attempted that in Duskendale. But, realizes his mistake when Rodrik falls off the back of the cart. He tells the people of Ironrath to retrieve Maester Ortengryn. ","Royland is last seen when Gryff confronts Rodrik in the courtyard. If Royland is Rodrik's Sentinel, he commends Talia's bravery when she stands up to Gryff, saying she is smart, wise, and knows how to tell it like it is. Gryff becomes enraged and says that she should know her station, grabbing Talia's arm and throwing her into the mud. Rodrik then has the option to punch Gryff or help Talia. When Rodrik is knocked down, he can order Royland to attack Gryff. Royland succeeds in beating back two Whitehills, but is tripped over by Harys who almost executes him. Royland is enraged for the remainder of the episode, questioning Gryff's honor and telling Rodrik to get up.","He later appears when Talia and Rodrik speak at the tower, speaking about the invitation to Highpoint. He departs and Rodrik chooses to take him or Duncan.","Royland first appears if he was your Sentinel, lamenting Arthur Glenmore's death and the loss of the house's allies. They share some information before Elaena arrives and sees her brother's corpse and he exits. Later he accompanies Rodrik to try and save Asher from an ambush by House Whitehill, although they manage to escape with most of Asher's forces they lose either Asher or Rodrik during the ambush.","Unfortunately, the Whitehills have broken through the gate and the rest of the army are closing in. Rodrik then returns after killing Ludd or Gryff. Rodrik can command him to either defend the gate or the smallfolk, who are being slaughtered by the enemy soldiers. Royland follows Rodrik into battle, killing several Whitehill soldiers in defense of Ironrath. However, the fight is futile, as Rodrik is seriously wounded by Harys and the gate is taken down by the Whitehills soldiers' battering ram.","Royland then leads the Ironrath soldiers into battle against the remaining Whitehills. When some enemy soldiers begin attacking the smallfolk, he asks Asher whether to have the soldiers help or focus on protecting the gate. If Asher chooses, Royland shouts at the soldiers to do what the Lord has chosen, if not, he appears shocked that Asher did not make a decision and doesn't tell the soldiers to do anything. He is then separated from Asher for much of the battle and not seen until Asher is surrounded, at which point he runs over and saves the Lord from being killed. Royland puts Asher on a horse and tells him to flee. If the traitor was killed by Rodrik, we do not see what happened to Royland after this. If the traitor wasn't killed, this somehow affects Royland's chances against the Whitehill army and we see him surrounded, as the codex reveals to be killed in battle.","If Royland was spared, during the Battle of Ironrath, Talia releases him and together they escape Ironrath and find the Lord, who escaped thanks to Duncan's sacrifice.

Qyburn explains that the Citadel stripped him of his chain, expelling him from the Order of Maesters, because they found some of his experiments \"too bold\". Later, Roose Bolton points out to Jaime that by treating him and accompanying him back to King's Landing Qyburn hopes Tywin Lannister will reward him by forcing the Citadel to give him back his chain. During their journey to the capital, Jaime asks Qyburn why exactly the Citadel took his chains, and Qyburn explains he experimented on living men, as \"the only way to treat disease is to understand disease, and the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.\"\n\nWhen Cersei Lannister recommends the services of Qyburn to a young Lady, Grand Maester Pycelle is infuriated, as he believes Qyburn brought shame on the Citadel with his experiments.\n\nAfter the poisoning of King Joffrey, Tywin questions Oberyn Martell about the assassination, as it is well known that he hates the Lannisters and he studied poisons at the Citadel.\n\nIn the trial by combat championed by Ser Gregor Clegane and Oberyn Martell, the former for the Crown and the latter for the accused Tyrion Lannister, Oberyn dies but he first poisons Clegane grievously with his spear, which was coated with Manticore venom. Cersei Lannister calls for Grand Maester Pycelle and Qyburn and, though the Grand Maester insists there is nothing to be done for him, Qyburn claims he can save Clegane. Pycelle protests, as Qyburn is not even a Maester, to which Qyburn replies that is for the best, as no maester knows how to save him. Pycelle exclaims that is the kind of arrogance that had him expelled from the Citadel, which considered Qyburn's experiments dangerous and unnatural, an opinion with which he agrees.\n\nCersei Lannister appoints Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers in the name of King Tommen, a decision Grand Maester Pycelle finds bewildering, as he is considered an embarassment to the Citadel.\n\nSamwell Tarly explains to Gilly that the Citadel, which harbors the largest library in the world, is located in Oldtown and it's where the maesters are trained.

Jon agrees and Sam gravely promises to return, before leaving Castle Black with Gilly and her son on a cart, beginning the long journey to the Citadel in Oldtown.\n\nSamwell and Gilly arrive at the Citadel. They enter a spacious chamber and Sam speaks to a maester seated at a large counter, writing. The maester listens to Sam's introduction and reads a letter written by Jon Snow while he was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and checks his records, which still list Jeor Mormont as Lord Commander and Aemon as maester. He tells Sam that he'll have to speak with an Archmaester and can wait in the library. He bars Gilly from joining Sam by sharply stating that no women or children are permitted. He then leads Sam into the extraordinary library, which stretches above and below for a number of floors, leaving an amazed Sam to gaze at all the levels and books.\n\nSam begins to fall into a pattern of servitude at the Citadel, under the tutorial of Archmaester Ebrose, but keeps more vigorously occupied with the healing of greyscale of Jorah Mormont and the discovery of dragonglass on Dragonstone island.\n\nReading through several of the books Samwell retrieves, Gilly is intrigued by various obscure bits of knowledge.

The identity of the knight was never specified."],"name":"Knight of the Laughing Tree","description":"In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Knight of the Laughing Tree was a mystery knight who fought at the Tourney at Harrenhal in the Year of the False Spring. He defended the honor of Howland Reed by challenging and defeating three knights whose squires had bullied him, demanding that they chastise the squires in order to ransom back their horses and armor. His nickname comes from the blazon on his shield, a smiling weirwood tree. His true identity remains unknown. Nonetheless, it is very easy to determine who the other characters in the story are, by simply matching the House sigils.\n\nMeera Reed tells his story to Bran Stark while they, along with Hodor and Jojen Reed, are travelling to the Wall. She recites it as follows:\n\n\"There was one knight, in the year of the false spring. The Knight of the Laughing Tree, they called him. He might have been a crannogman, that one. Or not.\n\nOnce there was a curious lad who lived in the Neck. He was small like all crannogmen, but brave and smart and strong as well. He grew up hunting and fishing and climbing trees, and learned all the magics of my people.\n\nHe could breathe mud and run on leaves, and change earth to water and water to earth with no more than a whispered word. He could talk to trees and weave words and make castles appear and disappear.\n\nThe lad knew the magics of the crannogs, but he wanted more. Our people seldom travel far from home you know. We're a small folk, and our ways seem queer to some, so the big people do not always treat us kindly. But this lad was bolder than most, and one day when he had grown to manhood he decided he would leave the crannogs and visit the Isle of Faces.\n\nIt was the green men he meant to find. So he donned a shirt sewn with bronze scales, took up a leathern shield and a three-pronged spear, and paddled a little skin boat down the Green Fork.\n\nHe passed beneath the Twins by night so the Freys would not attack him, and when he reached the Trident he climbed from the river and put his boat on his head and began to walk. It took him many a day, but finally he reached the Gods Eye, threw his boat in the lake, and paddled out to the Isle of Faces.\n\nAll that winter the crannogman stayed on the isle, but when spring broke he heard the wide world calling and knew the time had come to leave. His skin boat was just where he'd left it, so he said his farewells and paddled off toward shore. He rowed and rowed, and finally saw the distant towers of a castle rising beside the lake. The towers reached ever higher as he neared shore, until he realized this must be the greatest castle in all the world.\n\nBeneath it's walls he saw tents of many colors, bright banners cracking in the wind, and knights in mail and plate on barded horses. He smelled roasting meats, and heard the sound of laughter and the blare of heralds' trumpets. A great tourney was about to commence, and champions from all over the land had come to contest it. The king himself was there, with his son the dragon prince. The White Swords had come, to welcome a new brother to their ranks. The storm lord was on hand, and the rose lord as well. The great lion of the rock had quarreled with the king and stayed away, but many of his bannermen and knights attended all the same. The crannogman had never seen such pageantry, and knew he might never see the like again. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to be part of it.\n\nThe daughter of the great castle reigned as queen of love and beauty when the tourney opened. Five champions had sworn to defend her crown; her four brothers of Harrenhal, and her famous uncle, a white knight of the Kingsguard.\n\nBut there were others fairer still. One was the wife of the dragon prince, who'd brought a dozen lady companions to attend her. The knights all begged them for favors to tie about their lances.\n\nThe little crannogman was walking across the field, enjoying the warm spring day and harming none, when he was set upon by three squires. They were none older than fifteen, yet even so they were bigger than him , all three. This was their world, as they saw it, and he had no right to be there. They snatched away his spear and knicked him to the ground, cursing him for a frogeater.\n\nNone offered a name, but he marked their faces well so he could revenge himself upon them later. They shoved him down every time he tried to rise, and kicked him when he curled up on the ground. But then they heard a roar. 'That's my father's man you're kicking,' howled the she-wolf.\n\nThe she-wolf laid into the squires with a tourney sword, scattering them all. The crannogman was bruised and bloodied, so she took him back to her lair to clean his cuts and bind them up with linen. There he met her pack brothers: the wild wolf who led them, the quiet wolf beside him, and the pup who was youngest of the four.\n\nThat evening there was to be a feast in Harrenhal, to mark the opening of the tourney, and the she-wolf insisted that the lad attend. He was of high birth, with as much a right to a place on the bench as any other man. She was not easy to refuse, this wolf maid, so he let the young pup find him garb suitable to a king's feast, and went up to the great castle.\n\nUnder Harren's roof he ate and drank with the wolves, and many of their sworn swords besides, barrowdown men and moose and bears and mermen. The dragon prince sang a song so sad it made the wolf maid sniffle, but when her pup brother teased her for crying she poured wine over his head. A black brother spoke, asking the knights to join the Night's Watch. The storm lord drank down the knight of skulls and kisses in a wine-cup war. The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword, a red snake, and the lord of griffins, and lastly with the quiet wolf...but only after the wild wolf spoke to her on behalf of a brother too shy to leave his bench.\n\nAmidst all this merriment, the little crannogman spied the three squires who'd attacked him. One served a pitchfork knight, one a porcupine, while the last attended a knight with two towers on his surcoat, a sigil all crannogmen know well.\n\nThe wolf maid saw them too, and pointed them out to her brothers. 'I could find you a horse, and some armor that might fit,' the pup offered. The little crannogman thanked him, but gave no answer. His heart was torn. Crannogmen are smaller than most, but just as proud. The lad was no knight, no more than any of his people. We sit a boat more often then a horse, and our hands are made for oars, not lances. Much as he wished to have his vengeance, he feared he would only make a fool of himself and shame his people. The quiet wolf had offered the little crannogman a place in his tent that night, but before he slept he knelt on the lakeshore, looking across the water to where the Isle of Faces would be. and said a prayer to the old gods of north and Neck...\n\nFive days of jousting were planned. There was a great seven-sided melee as well, and archery and axe-throwing, a horse race, and tourney of singers...\n\nThe daughter of the castle was queen of love and beauty, with four brothers and an uncle to defend her, but all four sons of Harrenhal were defeated on the first day. Their conquerors reigned briefly as champions, until they were vanquished in turn. As it happened the end of the first day saw the porcupine knight win a place among the champions, and on the morning of the second day the pitchfork knight and the knight of the two towers were victorious as well. But late on the afternoon of that second day, as the shadows grew long, a mystery knight appeared in the lists.\n\nThe mystery knight was short of stature, and clad in ill-fitting armor made up of bits and pieces. The device upon his shield was a heart tree of the old gods, a white weirwood with a laughing red face.\n\nThe mystery knight dipped his lance before the king and rode to the end of the lists, where the five champions had their pavilions. He challenged the porcupine knight, the pitchfork knight, and the knight of the twin towers.\n\nWhoever he was, the old gods gave strength to his arm. The porcupine knight fell first, then the pitchfork knight, and lastly the knight of the two towers. None were well loved, so the common folk cheered lustily for the Knight of the Laughing Tree, as the new champion soon was called. When his fallen foes sought to ransom horse and armor, the Knight of the Laughing Tree spoke in a booming voice through his helm, saying, 'Teach your squires honor, that shall be ransom enough.' Once the defeated knights chastised their squires sharply, their horses and armor were returned. And so the little crannogman's prayer was answered...by the green men, or the old gods, or the children of the forest, who can say?\n\nThat night at the great castle, the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each swore they would unmask him, and the king himself urged men to challenge him,, declaring that the face behind that helm was no friend of his. But the next morning, when the heralds blew their trumpets and the king took his seat, only two champions appeared. The Knight of the Laughing Tree had vanished. The king was wroth, and even sent his son the dragon prince to seek the man, but all they ever found was his painted shield, hanging abandoned in a tree. It was the dragon prince who won that tourney in the end.\"\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Knight_of_the_Laughing_Tree"}}

According to folklore, his grave is located in the Great Barrow on the outskirts of Barrowton, the seat of House Dustin. The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook revealed that House Dustin, which once ruled the Barrowlands as Barrow Kings, claims descent from the First King himself.\n\nOn the other hand, while there are several myths about a first king of the First Men leading his people into Westeros, there are often rival myths in different areas, with various families each attempting to claim that their legendary founder was also the First King: In The Reach, for example, it is claimed that Garth Greenhand (the progenitor of all noble houses in the region) was not only the founder of the Reach, but the leader of all the First Men. The Maesters also debate whether the First Men could even have spread from Dorne up to the North within a single generation, and argue that it must have been a migration spanning many centuries. If this is the case, there may have been one king who led all of the First Men across the land bridge into Westeros, but he would have been succeeded by many later kings. The other possibility is that the First Men weren't even unified under a single ruler when they came to Westeros, but that different sub-groups and clans migrated in waves.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/First_King"}}

Moreover, little is known about the tenets or cultural beliefs of the religion (even compared to other Essos-based religions such as the Great Stallion of the Dothraki, or the Lord of Light religion).\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Meereen was constructed with 33 levels, because the number 33 is said to be sacred to the gods of the Ghiscari.\n\nDifferent sub-orders of Graces exist at the same temple, wearing different color robes to denote their function. The Blue Graces wear blue robes, and function as healers. The Red Graces are cult prostitutes. They are the only Graces that are allowed to have sex, while the others are sworn to chastity. The Green Grace is the high priestess, and there is only one Green Grace in each city.\n\nThe famous fighting pits found in Meereen are also said to be part of the religion: the combats are (allegedly) profoundly religious in nature, a blood sacrifice to the gods of Ghis. In theory, they are not mere butchery but a display of courage, skill, and strength for the gods. Though of course, the fighting pits also bring in a large amount of coin from spectators, and those who gamble on the gladiatorial fights.\n\nWhile the gods of Old Ghis are favored by the aristocratic slaver-families of the region, it is far from the only religion in Slaver's Bay. Many different religions can be found among the slave population, many of whom have been imported from disparate foreign lands (either recently or in generations past).\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ghiscari_religion"}}

To the west, its colonies became the Free Cities, which entered into a frantic one hundred year period of wars for domination known as the Century of Blood. To the east, Valyria's colonies formed into the modern cities of Slaver's Bay. The cities of the region such had once been colonies of the old Ghiscari Empire, before the Valyrians destroyed Old Ghis millennia before.\n\nYet with the threat of Valyria and its dragons gone, and its colonies left weakened and in disarray, the Dothraki khalasars were free to sweep across the entire continent. The years after the Doom saw the first great wave of Dothraki raids and pillaging, and none could withstand them.\n\nSoon, the Dothraki horde of Khal Temmo, numbering 20,000 riders, set its eyes in Qohor, the easternmost of the Free Cities, which directly borders the Dothraki Sea. Other Free Cities had suffered devastating raids in force, but never anything in such numbers: this time, Temmo intended to raze Qohor to the ground, and plunder its remains.\n\nFacing certain destruction, Qohor doubled its city guards, and prepared heavy armored cavalry to face the Dothraki. They also hired two full sellsword companies, one of which was the Second Sons. Almost as an afterthought, they sent an envoy to Astapor in Slaver's Bay, to purchase 3,000 of their Unsullied warrior-eunuch slave-soldiers. The Astapori claimed that the disciplined and relentlessly trained Unsullied were the legendary lock-step legions of Old Ghis come again, though most others believed that the age of infantry dominance had ended with the rise of the Valyrians and their dragons.\n\nUp until this point Temmo's khalasar had only faced frightened farmers with sharpened spears as they pillaged. Qohor was determined to make the first significant attempt to stop the Dothraki's advance. When Temmo arrived and saw the forces arrayed against him, his khalasar was actually eager to finally face a real fight.\n\nOn the first day of battle, before the Unsullied arrived, the Qohorik forces were annihilated. Their heavy horse were butchered by the mobile Dothraki light cavalry, who cut down men using their Arakh blades like scythes. The Dothraki archers also fired from horseback, so that the rain of arrows came both as they advanced and as they withdrew to set up the next charge. The two sellsword companies fled the battle rather than face such hopless odds.\n\nYet during the night, as the Dothraki feasted to celebrate their victory, the relatively small force of Unsullied managed to slip past their lines. When the second day dawned, the Dothraki awoke to see 3,000 Unsullied arrayed before the gates of Qohor, their companies arrayed in precise formation.\n\nThe Dothraki could easily have flanked around the relatively small number of Unsullied, but the Dothraki think nothing of infantry, arrogantly considering them good for nothing but riding down. Twenty thousand Dothraki riders charged the Unsullied lines, but their phalanxes held firm with fearless discipline. Many Dothraki died on the fence of Unsullied spears. Temmo had his archers let loose upon the Unsullied, but they raised and locked their shields above their heads and weathered the incoming fire. The Dothraki charged the Unsullied phalanxes a total of eighteen times, yet each time they were repulsed.\n\nBy the end, only 600 of the 3,000 Unsullied survived - yet 12,000 Dothraki were dead, including Khal Temmo and all his sons. For the first time in history, the invincible Dothraki hordes now knew the bitter taste of defeat.\n\nAfter the battle, the new khal led the surviving Dothraki up to the city gates. As per Dothraki custom, one by one each man cut off his hair braid to let the whole world know his shame of defeat, and then threw the braid down before the feet of the Unsullied.\n\nThe reputation of the new Unsullied legions was firmly solidified in Essos. Afterwards, Qohor has maintained a standing garrison of Unsullied purchased from Slaver's Bay. Several of the other Free Cities, or wealthy merchant-princes from them, also often buy smaller companies of Unsullied for their own protection. After the Battle of Qohor, even the Dothraki came to respect the Unsullied as they do no other infantry in the world, whom they usually regard with contempt.\n\nSince that day, the Dothraki hordes were still thought to be a formidable force, but no longer were they considered invincible. Many great Dothraki raids and campaigns would occur in the subsequent four centuries, but few of the vast scale seen in the immediate aftermath of Valyria's fall. Eventually, as the Free Cities stabilized and their own internal conflicts from the Century of Blood ended, they settled into a new relationship with the Dothraki. The Free Cities realized that it was less destructive to simply offer the Dothraki tribute than it was to fight them. Dothraki khalasars, while they rarely admitted it, also realized after Qohor that there was a small but real chance that they would be destroyed if they attempted to launch a full-scale attack on one of the Free Cities. Every now and again they would still make a punitive raid, either because they were dissatisfied with a tribute, or simply felt they hadn't had a good fight in a while, but these were rarely large attempts to actually take and destroy one of the cities. There have of course been occasional exceptions, when a particularly brazen khal has tried, but they never entirely succeeded - in part due to the standing garrisons of Unsullied that Qohor and some of the other Free Cities maintained.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Battle_of_Qohor"}}

She is Cotter's younger sister."],"name":"Sylvi","description":"Sylvi is a wildling who grew up with her brother Cotter in a village near Hardhome. She was born with white hair, and was seen as a bad omen by the other villagers, who stayed away from her and had hoped that she would've died before her second name day. Because of her white hair, her mother gave her the nickname \"Little Moon\". After her second name day and Sylvi was given her name, the villagers threatened Sylvi's mother to leave the village. Instead, from what Cotter said in \"A Nest of Vipers\", it is assumed that Sylvi's mother wrapped her in furs and left her in the forest to die. After Cotter had seen this, he went out and recovered Sylvi, and left the village and their mother.\n\nAfter a few years, Cotter was separated from Sylvi, and was forced to join the Night's Watch, leaving Sylvi to fend for herself in the wild for several months. Sylvi eventually settles in an abandoned hunting camp, where she keeps her possessions such as a talisman with a bear on it. It is assumed that the bear talisman was given to her by her mother, and she marks the trees with the symbol in hopes that Cotter will find her. At some point, she also came in contact with several female wildling hunters, who appear in \"Sons of Winter\". Sylvi is proficient with a spear, knows how to hunt, and survive in the wild. \n\nWhen Gared Tuttle, Cotter, optionally Finn rest at an seemingly abandoned wildling camp after their encounter with a group of female wildings, Gared searches the camp's hut, where Sylvi holds him at spear point. Cotter emerges, and he and Sylvi hug. He introduces them to the Sylvi, stating that she can take them to the North Grove.\n\nAfter seeing that Cotter has been treated for an injury or the actual injury on his arm, Sylvi begins questioning Gared on how Cotter got the injury. Regardless of what he says, Sylvi disapproves of Gared, saying that he didn't belong North of the Wall, and that she and her brother don't need to die for him trying to look for the North Grove. Sylvi adamantly decides that she and her brother are going to head South, to join Mance Rayder and then goes off to hunt for food.\n\nAfter Gared leaves the camp, he interrupts Sylvi while she is hunting, accidentally scaring away a rabbit that she barely misses with her spear. After they talk a little bit, they continue hunting. After they've finished hunting, Sylvi asks Gared if he's ever lost somebody he's cared about, and tells him that she won't risk losing her brother again, not even for the North Grove. Gared is interested about what she has to say about the North Grove, and Sylvi tells him that a few years ago one of the Ice-River Clans set out to find it. She tells him that they had heard North Grove isn't touched by the cold, even during the Winter, and that the Ice-River Clan never returned.\n\nThey then hear Cotter yell out for Gared, and they run back to find the Wights of the female hunters encountered last episode attacking the camp. Sylvi says that she knew them, then helps Gared and Cotter fight the Wights. During the fight, Sylvi tells Gared that fire is the only way to kill a Wight. After the fight, they see that more Wights are coming, and the trio flees North, hoping they can find refuge in the North Grove. \n\nWhile Gared is searching for the North Grove, Sylvi will ask her if he found it. When Gared is able to find it, they get attacked by a bear. Gared is able to fend it off and they are able to reach the Grove. Sylvi is then tied up while Elsera Snow offers to help Cotter. While tied up she informs Gared that the free folk of the North Grove are not normal and the place has an evil vibe. The North Grove is then attacked by Wights but Gared, Elsera and Josera Snow are able to defeat them. They return to find that Sylvi has escaped but she is soon caught by Elsera's wildlings. Sylvi meets her brother and after seeing that he is suffering, asks Gared to put him out of misery. To carry out the task, she hands him nightshade. Gared can choose to kill Cotter using nightshade or rip his heart out and use it to harness the power of the Grove as requested by Elsera. If he does the latter, Sylvi will be angry at him during Cotter's funeral. If Gared chooses to stay in the North Grove, then during the ending of the episode she is seen preparing to defend the Grove against Wights.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sylvi"}}

Mormont says that they have to stay long enough for their wounded to recover enough to be fit to travel, but Craster waves this off, saying they've recovered as much as they ever will. Craster openly suggests that they should just kill the men who are so severely wounded that they won't be able to travel, and if Mormont is reluctant to do the deed himself, he can just leave and Craster will finish them off. Mormont declines. Another young Night's Watch man, Karl, comes in to complain that Craster is feeding them nothing but bread cut with sawdust, and he wants to know where Craster keeps his hidden larder. Meanwhile, Craster is sitting there getting quite drunk on the wine they gifted to him when they first came. Rast joins in the accusations, and Craster admits that he has winter stockpiles, but he needs those to feed his women and refuses to share them. Rast calls Craster a bastard - at which Craster becomes enraged and threatens Rast with an axe. Mormont restraints Rast, and Craster shouts that he's throwing them all out to lay down outside in the cold on their empty bellies. Craster says he will chop the hands off the next man who calls him \"bastard\". A tense moment of silence passes, and Mormont grabs Rast to lead him out the doorway...  ...when Karl, firmly staring directly at Craster, challenges him by calling him a \"daughter-fucking, wildling bastard\". Craster lunges forward at Karl in a blind rage, but he is drunk and clumsy. Without flinching, Karl holds off Craster's axe with his left hand, while using his right hand to ram a dagger through Craster's throat, which goes up into the roof of his mouth. He flings the dying Craster to the ground, then punches one of Craster's wives who is present, demanding to know where the hidden food is kept. Lord Commander Mormont bellows that the gods will curse him for this, as a guest killing a host who has formally accepted him into his home breaks all the laws of gods and men. Karl shouts that there are no laws beyond the Wall. Karl continues to threaten the girl with a knife, so Mormont draws his sword, which makes Karl drop the girl and begin to face off against Mormont with his dagger. As Mormont threatens to have Karl executed, Rast comes up behind Mormont and literally stabs the Lord Commander in the back, which makes Mormont drop his sword. For a brief moment the men stare in shock, then Grenn charges and tackles Karl. The entire room explodes into pure bedlam.\n\nThe desperate Night's Watch recruits like Rast, mostly conscripted criminals exiled to the Wall, turn on officers who are loyal to Mormont, as well as some of the other common recruits like Grenn who stay loyal. Quick flashes of the fight go by as no one can really perceive what's happening, and the mutiny spreads throughout Craster's Keep. In the midst of it, Mormont turns around to fight off Rast. Mormont may have a knife in his back but he is twice Rast's size and completely enraged. Mormont grabs Rast by the throat and lifts him off his feet, one-handed, then spins him around and hurls him against the opposite wall. Still choking Rast, Mormont nearly succeeds in crushing Rast's windpipe with his bare hand - but then Mormont starts to cough up thick red blood. His knife wound is mortal. The injured Mormont then sinks to the ground and continues to cough up blood. Now that Mormont is on the ground unarmed and helpless, Rast grabs a knife and repeatedly pounds it into Mormont's throat until the Old Bear is dead.\n\nSamwell Tarly later informs Maester Aemon of Mormont's murder, and Aemon orders him to send letters all over Westeros reporting it and pleading for help. Davos Seaworth shows the letter to Stannis Baratheon, who under Melisandre's advice decides to travel to the Wall to aid the Night's Watch against any threats towards the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nAfter the Mutiny at Craster's Keep, Karl and the mutineers desecrated Mormont's corpse. Karl has taken the late Lord Commander's skull as a crude cup from which to drink wine and use for his amusement.\n\nJon later uses Mormont's murder to persuade several of his black brothers to aid him in hunting down and killing the mutineers in order to stop them from revealing vital information to Mance Rayder. Mormont is avenged when Karl and Rast are killed by Jon and Ghost, respectively.\n\nJeor's dream of Jon succeeding him comes true when Jon is elected the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.\n\nWhile travelling to Meereen, Tyrion Lannister recalls to Jorah Mormont on how he met Jeor during his trip to the Wall, and reveals that he was killed by his own men during a ranging beyond the Wall. Jorah is visibly shocked to hear of his father's murder.\n\nDuring a visit to Bear Island, Jon invokes Jeor's name as he attempts to enlist his niece, Lyanna Mormont, into joining his campaign to take back Winterfell back from Ramsay Bolton.\n\nWhile training to become a maester in the Citadel in Oldtown, Samwell Tarly attempts to cure Jorah Mormont of his greyscale infection, citing his respect for Jeor as a primary reason, and revealing that he was with Jeor when he died.\n\nWhen Jorah is deemed fully cured of the disease, by Archmaester Ebrose, Sam says it was the least he could do due to his relationship with Jeor.\n\nJon makes himself known to Jorah on his arrival on Dragonstone, mentioned his stewardship under the command over Jeor.\n\nDuring their trip beyond the Wall, Jorah and Jon discuss Jeor. Jon offers Jorah back the sword Longclaw, claiming that it belongs to the Mormont family. After a brief moment, however, Jorah gives the sword back to Jon, claiming that Jeor gave it to him and that Longclaw now belongs to Jon - and his children afterwards.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Jeor_Mormont"}}

He later sides with House Stark and proclaims Jon Snow the King in the North after Jon retakes Winterfell from House Bolton.","He chose the name \"Seaworth\" for his family's new noble House, as a reference to his smuggling past. Highborn members of older noble Houses disparagingly called Davos \"the Onion Knight\" for his actions, but he has embraced this title and proudly took an onion for a sigil and sewed it onto his ship's sails.","The fleet travels north along the coast. Davos predicts that they are just one day's sail from their destination. Stannis admires Davos's loyalty and honesty and the way he copes with the snobbery of the highborn. He recalls Davos's timely intervention saving many lives in the siege of Storm's End. Stannis's wife nearly died of hunger and the castle was down to eating rats, before Davos managed to sneak through the blockade with his ship full of onions, potatoes, fish, and some beef. Getting to the point, Stannis tells Davos that he will serve as his Hand of the King when he takes the Iron Throne, to Davos's surprise.","Davos finds Stannis despondent and condemns Melisandre for the human sacrifices and for leading Stannis astray. She reminds that it was he who urged Stannis not to bring her to the battle, and implies that it was the defeat and the massive deaths, including that of Matthos, were his fault. Davos draws a knife on her in a fit of rage, but he is restrained by a pair of guards. Stannis orders him to be put in the dungeon. Davos is dragged out, protesting to Stannis that Melisandre will lead them all to ruin.","Davos is present alongside Stannis when his forces crush the wildling army led by Mance Rayder. He is the one who informs Mance that he stands before Stannis, the one true king of Westeros. Davos also meets Jon Snow, who was actually attempting to assassinate Mance before they arrived, notably ordering Jon to address Stannis as \"Your Grace\" instead of by his name.

Melisandre soon joins them, pressing Jon for details about what he saw while dead. When Jon replies that he saw nothing, Davos ushers Melisandre out before she can declare a new prince that was promised, and advises Jon that while he did die, he is alive now and thus needs to accept it.

However, he then converses with Jon over their safety with the foreign allies on Dragonstone.","Davos survives the wildfire explosion and makes his way back to Dragonstone, intending to kill Melisandre, whom he holds responsible to the defeat and the loss of four of his sons. Melisandre foresees his intention, and he is thrown into the dungeons as soon as he arrives at Dragonstone. Stannis eventually frees him and promotes him to the King's Hand. Maester Pylos, not Shireen, teaches Davos to read."],"name":"Davos Seaworth","description":"Davos Seaworth is very loyal to his king. He is considered to be the closest friend that Stannis Baratheon ever had, which is impressive enough because Stannis had few friends due to his pitiless and cold personality. Davos's sense of personal loyalty has also, ironically enough, put him at odds with Stannis, especially when Melisandre was concerned - Davos openly mistrusted, and ultimately hated the Red Woman, but also feared that Melisandre would corrupt Stannis with her prophecies and promises of greatness. Davos is also a very dedicated man in his own right, originally opting to ensure that his son Matthos had a better life than he did, since Davos grew up in absolute poverty in King's Landing until he met Stannis. This gave Davos an unusual amount of empathy and compassion, since he supported Gendry's survival since his arrival on Dragonstone, using their aligning poverty in Flea Bottom as a way of gaining the young man's trust. It is almost hopelessly ironic that Davos's good nature and compassion is met with outrage or controversy by anybody else.\n\nDavos has no prejudice towards followers of another religion (which he himself expresses to Melisandre) but he believes that the Lord of Light himself is evil on the basis that his favor requires followers to burn people alive at the stake. He is shown to be rather frightened of the powers that Melisandre possesses, as shown when he witnesses her create a shadow to kill Renly Baratheon. It is unfortunate that his warnings against Stannis utilising Melisandre and her powers to achieve his goals fell on deaf ears, since doing so would have meant avoiding an untold amount of destruction (which ironically is the reason that Melisandre used to persuade Stannis to keep her as an ally). Davos is a very practical man, understanding entirely that men and arms and territory win wars, not the hopeful prayers to some fire god. His suggestions to hire sellsword companies to Stannis's cause may have been met with incredulity by Stannis himself, but it would have been a potentially effective move.\n\nDavos had a very close relationship with Stannis's daughter and only child, Princess Shireen Baratheon, and was not at all bothered or intimidated by her disfigurement, which is impressive among most men. Davos was close enough with Shireen that she was the person who taught him how to read, and she openly didn't care that Davos was considered a traitor by Stannis and Melisandre because Davos was her friend. Davos even jokingly remarked that he saw similarities between father and daughter, demonstrating that he was almost as close with her as he was with Stannis. This friendship would become a tragic blow to Davos later on when he realized that Melisandre had Shireen burned at the stake to win favor with her precious Lord of Light - he exploded with rage against Melisandre upon hearing her confess and insists that Shireen's sacrifice was completely futile, since it achieved absolutely nothing in the end. Even after Jon Snow decided to banish the Red Woman on pain of death, Davos coldly threatened to execute Melisandre himself if they ever saw each other again, which is a massive departure from Davos's usual nature.\n\nDavos is unfazed by the condescension he has received from other high lords in Westeros for his common nature, which Stannis commended, expressing more contempt for such lords than Davos himself ever did. Davos was, in a way, of better service to Stannis or whomever he served than any other lord, considering the fact that he was unfailingly loyal to both Stannis, and later Jon Snow. He was not bothered by bastardy or by a person's disfigurements or social shortcomings, as evidenced by his relationship with Shireen and Jon.\n\nAlthough he claims not being a skilled fighter, Davos is a very brave man who does not hesitate to put his life in danger when serving his lord. He notably took part in the Battle of the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards, to which he survived, and was also willing to fight against the Night's Watch mutineers who had killed Jon Snow, as well as risking to return to King's Landing while he was still officially considered a criminal.\n\nDavos also displays a forgiving nature, or at least does not harbor any kind of resentment towards people who could deserve it. He does not blame Stannis for cutting his fingers after he smuggled supplies during the Siege of Storm's End, neither does he formally blame Tyrion Lannister who masterminded the wildfire explosion which killed his son Matthos during the Battle of the Blackwater (he casually notices it when smuggling Tyrion into King's Landing but without a tone of reproach). The only exception known to Davos' forgiving nature is Melisandre, who Davos swore to execute should their paths meet again.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Davos_Seaworth"}}

They are also often (and half-derisively) called \"Dothraki screamers\", because of their fierce war cries as they charge into battle and raids."],"name":"Dothraki","description":"The Dothraki are nomadic horse-mounted warriors, who sweep across the vast central plains of Essos in search of plunder. Most of their society is centered around their horses: even their name for themselves in their own language, \"Dothraki\", literally means \"riders\". Dothraki boys learn to shoot bows from horseback when they are only four years old. The Dothraki will abandon a sick or injured leader who can no longer ride a horse.\n\nThe Dothraki are divided into several nameless clans known as khalasars, led by a single leader, the khal . The khalasars roam the Dothraki Sea, always on the move looking for new pasture lands and new targets for plundering. The Dothraki frequently raid neighboring regions, such as Lhazar to the southeast or the Free Cities to the west. The Dothraki live by taking what they need including supplies, valuables, and new captives to serve them as slaves. The Dothraki respect force, and thus only respect those who are able to successfully resist them, while conquered slaves deserve only contempt. The Dothraki are usually dismissive of infantry (with the notable exception of the elite Unsullied warrior-eunuch legions).\n\nThe Dothraki traditionally fight with curved swords known as arakhs, and also employ bolas, daggers, and whips, or huge, recurved bows with impressive range and striking power that can be fired from horseback. They also shun armor, considering speed and freedom of movement to be more important in battle. Dothraki warriors wear their hair in a long braid and only cut it when defeated, so the world may see their shame.  Very capable warriors therefore often have a very long braid. As light cavalry, their attacks are extremely fast and deadly, but they are vulnerable to archers and on the ground they are less effective against armored infantry despite their speed.  However, they seldom attack on foot except for individual combat, so they usually retain the advantage.\n\nThe only Dothraki city is Vaes Dothrak, located to the far north-east of the Dothraki sea. It is ruled by the Dosh khaleen, crones and wise women who were once the wives of now dead khals. All Dothraki commerce (with fellow Dothraki and other Essosi peoples) is done in the marketplaces of the city, and all sacred rituals are conducted there. Drawing weapons or shedding blood is forbidden inside Vaes Dothrak - although there are loopholes around this if an execution absolutely must take place. Provided that the target is killed in a method that does not shed blood (such as strangling or burning), it is permissible.\n\nDothraki do not trust salt water, because their horses cannot drink it. The literal term for \"ocean\" in the Dothraki language is \"poison water\". They refuse to sail in ships over the oceans. Thus they are not considered a threat by the Westerosi because they will not cross the Narrow Sea.  However, Drogo was willing to consider it when provoked enough, and the remainder of Daenerys's  khalasar (about 100 Dothraki) loyally made the journey across Slaver's Bay with her to Astapor, though many became ill because they were unaccustomed to sea travel.\n\nDespite their disdain for the seafaring, Daenerys's newly acquired khalasar of 100,000 Dothraki declare their commitment to cross the \"poison water\" in \"wooden horses\" for the conquest that Drogo had promised, after she had emerged from the flames and thus proved herself to be their leader at the khalar vezhven. Giving them time to adjust, Daenerys trained her khalasar not only to be comfortable on ships, but to actually crew them when her armada set sail for Westeros.\n\nIt is said that the Dothraki \"don't believe in money\", instead taking what they want through raiding (which includes enslaving defeated peoples). The two resources they actually have on the plains of the Dothraki Sea are miles upon miles of grass, and horses. As people can't eat grass, the main staples of the Dothraki diet are horse meat and fermented mare's milk.\n\nWhat material wealth or precious objects they do possess have been acquired through raiding surrounding nations such as the Free Cities, Slaver's Bay, or Lhazar, or from raiding other Dothraki hordes to take their plunder secondhand. The Dothraki do not so much function on the barter system, as they use the honor system: they frown upon \"trade\" but honor the exchange of gifts, such as tribute. Long ago the Free Cities decided that it was often less destructive to just give the Dothraki massive tributes in gold, finished products, and slaves, than to try to fight them off (though a Dothraki horde might still attack if they find the gift insufficient, or if they just haven't had a good fight in a while). The Dothraki will not reciprocate these \"gifts\" on an immediate quid pro quo trade system. However, they will as a rule keep their word to eventually give a gift which they have promised, though they will do it in their own time.\n\nIn practice, however, if a Dothraki horde has a particular need for a resource that it cannot obtain through direct raiding, i.e. new armor and weapons, they will resort to actual \"barter\" by \"gifting\" slaves they have captured in return for finished products from the Free Cities or Slaver's Bay.\n\nMirroring the importance of the horse in their culture, the Dothraki religion worships a deity known as the Great Stallion. The Dosh khaleen crones are the leaders of the religion.\n\nDothraki religion also rejects the employment of blood magic. For this reason, maegi are distrusted and hated by Dothraki.\n\nThe Dothraki have their own language, which is quite different from the Common Tongue of Westeros.\n\nImportant Dothraki terminology:\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nIn Daenerys Targaryen's remaining khalasar after the death of Khal Drogo:\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Dothraki are numerous and are divided into large hordes or khalasars which range over vast areas. Khal Drogo's khalasar consists of 40,000 warriors and is said to be unusually large. The Dothraki are mostly active on the Dothraki sea, a vast inland area of grassy plains and steppes, but sometimes raid into the Free Cities to the west and Slaver's Bay and Lhazar to the south. The Dothraki are untrusting of outsiders, but respectful of capable warriors even from other cultures. They particularly dislike those who have inherited their titles and done nothing to earn them. Though the Dothraki also consider the sea as poison water since their horses cannot drink it, the books establish that at least some Dothraki have crossed the Narrow Sea to Westeros, such as Zollo and Iggo, who serve in the sellsword company, the Brave Companions, under Vargo Hoat (Locke in the TV series)\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin has stated that the Dothraki are inspired by a loose mix of the Mongols, Huns, Alans, Turks, Native American plains tribes, and various other nomadic horse-riding peoples who lived on the open steppe.\n\nIn appearance, the Dothraki are a large people, with copper-toned skin, dark eyes, and dark hair. In facial features, their eyes are almond-shaped.\n\nAccording to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, \"Dothraki\" is pronounced \"Doth-RACK-ee\". David J. Peterson has pointed out that peculiarly, author George R.R. Martin pronounces the final \"i\" in the word \"Dothraki\" long, like the final \"i\" in \"fungi\" or \"alumni\", but he's the only one that pronounces it that way. It isn't pronounced that way in the official audio books, or anywhere else.\n\nnull\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dothraki"}}

From infancy, Jon is presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, and raised by Eddard alongside his lawful children at Winterfell but his true parentage is kept secret from everyone, including Jon himself. In order to escape his bastard status, Jon joins the Night's Watch and is eventually chosen as Lord Commander. However, his decision to allow thousands of Free Folk, who are fleeing the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead, safe passage through the Wall alienates many of his black brothers, culminating in a mutiny where Jon is killed. Soon after, he is resurrected by Melisandre and Jon executes the mutineers. Jon, freed from his Night's Watch vows that ended when he died, joins his cousin, Sansa Stark, in building an army to retake Winterfell from House Bolton. After securing help from a few other Northern Houses and the Vale of Arryn, they successfully retake the castle from Ramsay Bolton, restoring House Stark's dominion over the North with Jon being declared the new King in the North by the gathered Northern and Vale lords. By the end of Season 7, Jon pledges himself and his army to Daenerys Targaryen, rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and steps down as King of the North.","Robert would ultimately kill Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, effectively ensuring their victory in the war. After the Sack of King's Landing, Ned continued south in search of his sister and ultimately found her at the Tower of Joy in the Red Mountains at the border of Dorne. Ned and his companions engaged in a final fierce melee with the remaining Targaryen Kingsguard, which resulted in the deaths of all combatants save Ned himself and Howland Reed.","Jon Snow spent the next seventeen years being raised in Winterfell as Lord Eddard's illegitimate son, alongside his trueborn children with his wife. Understandably, Eddard never told anyone, including Catelyn or Jon himself, who his mother was or even if she was still alive. When pressed by King Robert Baratheon, whom he couldn't deny an answer, Ned went as far as to concoct a vague explanation that Jon's mother was some lowborn woman named \"Wylla\" that he met during the war. Lady Catelyn's eldest son, Robb, would be acknowledged unquestionably as Eddard's heir, but Jon was otherwise never treated much differently than her younger sons Bran and Rickon.","Later when King Robert Baratheon and his entourage arrive for a great feast in the main hall, Jon is not allowed to attend for fear of offending the royal guests (on Catelyn's suggestion), so he waits outside in the courtyard venting his frustrations against a practice dummy. There he meets Tyrion Lannister, Queen Cersei Lannister's younger brother, who also stepped outside. As a dwarf, Tyrion knows what it is like to be an outcast, so he gives the young man some advice: never try to hide what he is, for the world will not forget. Instead, he should wear the name \"bastard\" openly, like armor, and then it can never be used to hurt him. When Jon's uncle Benjen Stark arrives, Jon tells him he has been thinking about it, and before his father leaves for the south he wants to join the Night's Watch, as they don't care about recruits' pasts and even a bastard can rise to positions of high honor in it.","Lord Commander Jeor Mormont prepares Jon for a command role as the Great Ranging travels North seeking Benjen Stark and an explanation for the wight attack. They pass through several abandoned wildling villages before arriving at the home of their unsavory ally Craster. Jon is perplexed when he learns that Craster incestuously marries his own daughters but apparently has no sons. He takes an instant dislike to Craster when they meet with him. The feeling is mutual but Craster does reveal to Jeor that he has not seen Benjen and that the wildlings are gathering with their leader, King Beyond the Wall Mance Rayder. Jeor reprimands Jon for failing to follow his lead with Craster - the man disgusts him as well, but unfortunately he's one of the few wildlings who is willing to give them shelter and supplies which mean the difference between life and death for many black brothers in the wild.","After surviving the perilous climb of the Wall, Jon Snow, Ygritte and the wildlings led by Tormund Giantsbane advance through the Gift - the strip of land immediately south of the Wall which the Watch draws supplies from - and continue on towards Castle Black, to await Mance Rayder's signal to begin the attack. Afterwards Jon confronts Orell about cutting his and Ygritte's rope loose on the Wall, nearly killing the both of them in the process. Orell tells Jon that he doesn't see Ygritte complaining about what happened because she is a wildling and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation, also telling Jon that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her. During the journey through the woods, a clearly jealous Orell confronts Ygritte and says that he would be a better man for her than Jon Snow, while continuing to express his distrust in him. Jon also tries to persuade Ygritte that the wildlings' cause is doomed to failure, but she refuses to listen and points out that Jon is technically one of them; if it fails, so does he. She restates her passion for him and tells him bluntly that if they die, they die, but before they die they will live.","Later that night, Jon hears the horn blowing and looks north, witnessing a tremendous conflagration north of the Wall, just as Mance had promised him. Jon approaches Thorne, who finally relents and admits that they should have heeded his advice and sealed the tunnel, but grimly muses that leadership means not second-guessing oneself because of \"clever little twats\" like him. While they start to prepare for the massive wildling army that is emerging from the woods, another horn blows from down below at Castle Black, signaling the unanticipated appearance of Tormund's band of wildlings at Castle Black. Alliser decides to go down and defend the keep, leaving Janos Slynt in charge of the Wall's defenses. Even though a wildling strike force led by two giants,  one of which is riding a mammoth, charge towards Castle Black's outer gate, Janos Slynt does nothing and breaks down, demoralizing the troops. Grenn steps in by falsely claiming that Alliser needs Janos back down in Castle Black, allowing Jon to take command of the Wall's defenses.","Jon is approached by Stannis and Davos about the offer of legitimization. As the new Lord Commander, Jon reminds the king that his place is with the Night's Watch, even though his dream was to be a Stark. Stannis, a man of duty, respects his decision to keep his vow and tells Jon he intends to march on Winterfell within a fortnight since the Night's Watch cannot afford to feed both his army and the wildling prisoners. He also recommends sending Alliser Thorne to command Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and that executing the wildling prisoners would be the safest choice. Stannis then leaves, but Davos stays behind and tries to further persuade Jon to help Stannis retake the North. Davos iterates that the Night's Watch is \"the shield that guards the realms of men\", telling Jon that it may not just mean protecting the Seven Kingdoms from beyond the Wall, but possibly taking part in battles in order to prevent the Seven Kingdoms from suffering, such as the North will under Bolton rule.","While discussing strategy with Davos, Melisandre, Sansa, Brienne, Edd, and Tormund, Jon bitterly notes that they simply don't have the numbers to challenge the Boltons at present. Even though the three most powerful houses are already backing the Boltons, Jon suggests rallying the weaker houses, as their combined strength would give them a numerical advantage when combined with his current forces. When Sansa mentions Brynden Tully's recapture of Riverrun and the virtual guarantee of support from the Tullys, Jon is surprised that Sansa has such valuable information. Thereafter, Jon, Sansa, Tormund and Brienne leave Castle Black.","At Winterfell, Jon, Sansa, and Davos discuss Tyrion's letter that they have received. While Sansa suspects it might be a trap, Jon doesn't think so due to Tyrion ending the letter with the line \"all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers' eyes\", which Tyrion has told Jon in their first meeting years ago. Even so, Jon agrees that now is not the right time to go to Dragonstone. Davos opines that Dany will make a good ally in the war to come against the White Walkers.","Main: Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen","* Appears as a corpse.","Despite initial claims from Harington, Benioff and Weiss that Jon had been killed off for good following the fifth season, Harington later hinted that Jon would return in some way, which was proven true in the sixth season. Harington confirmed that he had been told to lie to the rest of the cast and even his friends and family. Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, apparently believed him, while Liam Cunningham, who plays Davos Seaworth, did not (reportedly laughingly telling Harington to \"fuck off\"). Even the rest of the cast were forced to assert that Jon was dead, such as Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, while Natalie Dormer said that Jon was \"dead right now.....right now\", hinting that he would return. Throughout production, the name \"Jon Snow\" was not even allowed to be mentioned except for script-readouts; he was referred to only as \"LC\" (Lord Commander). Rampant speculation broke out after the leaking of a photograph which showed Harington as Jon wearing the outfit of a House Stark soldier, fueling fans' beliefs that Jon was not gone for good. The first poster released for the sixth season featured a bloodied-but-apparently-alive Jon, further teasing that Jon would return. After the airing of \"Home\", Harington issued a public apology to the series' fanbase for lying to everyone and expressed appreciation for the fans' love for his character.","Jon's resurrection in the television series implies that he will return in The Winds of Winter.","It has long been believed in Westeros that only members of the Targaryen bloodline can easily bond with and ride dragons - which is one of the reasons they so readily accepted Daenerys Targaryen (though that was also because she hatched them, becoming their adoptive mother). The revelation about Jon's real parentage means that he may potentially bond with one of Daenerys's three dragons in a future novel - after all, she has three dragons but only personally rides Drogon, the largest. To a lesser extent this might also be true of the Baratheons - Robert Baratheon was Rhaegar's second cousin in the books. With the deaths of Stannis and Shireen in the TV series, the only living member of the Baratheon bloodline is Robert's bastard son Gendry (who is in fact Jon Snow's third cousin). House Martell also intermarried with the Targaryens but not recently, about a century ago: in the books Doran Martell's middle son Quentyn (cut from the TV show) traveled to Meereen and explicitly hoped his small amount of Targaryen blood would be enough to make the dragons trust him and try to mount one, but he got roasted alive instead."],"name":"Jon Snow","description":"Because he was raised by Ned Stark at Winterfell, Jon has adopted a clear moral compass and a true sense of honor, which he tries his hardest to abide by even when he must make a difficult decision, especially after he became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He has always admired and idolized his father, but due to Catelyn Stark's cold disdain for Jon, Eddard was careful not to give him more attention than his lawful children by Catelyn. Lady Stark was never actively mean to Jon, but because he wasn't her own son she intentionally ignored him (as is common for bastard children), meaning that Jon grew up without a mother-figure. Nor did Jon consider Catelyn's behavior to be unusual or unexpected: it is rare for a noble to raise their bastard child alongside their lawful children, and his presence was a great insult to her honor. While his interactions with Catelyn remained awkward or nonexistent, he actually became good friends with his half-siblings, particularly Robb and Arya. Robb was of the same age as Jon so they became playmates and comrades in training, while due to her tomboyish personality Arya was also something of a social misfit like Jon, which they bonded over.\n\nLike many bastard children, Jon had to learn to grow up quickly. This made Jon mature and perceptive beyond his age, so he could navigate his complicated relationships within the Stark household. His bastard status has also made Jon something of a loner, solemn and somber with a desire to prove himself to society and to his father. Jon thought that the best way for a bastard in his position to gain honor and respect was to join the Night's Watch, emulating his uncle Benjen, because past social status is ignored after joining the Watch. Despite his introverted demeanor, Jon is very compassionate and protective of his fellow outcasts such as Samwell Tarly, Grenn, and Pyp.\n\nIn many ways, Jon has been unusually lucky for a bastard child, given how rare it is for a lord to raise one in his own castle alongside his lawful children. For all of Jon's misgivings about not knowing his mother and Catelyn ignoring and shunning him, he was loved by his father and siblings, was never poor or hungry, but lived in a castle and had a noble's upbringing. Jon was formally educated by Maester Luwin and was trained in combat by Ser Rodrik Cassel, excelling at swordsmanship. This made Jon somewhat arrogant when he was a new recruit at Castle Black, until Tyrion pointed out that the other recruits were all far less fortunate than he was. This humbles Jon, and he changes his behavior to be the champion of the other downtrodden recruits, and helps train them by walking them through the swordplay techniques he knows.\n\nThe Starks were an interfaith household, with Eddard and Catelyn's children being exposed to not only the religion of the Old Gods of the Forest worshiped by most Northmen, but also Catelyn's devout adherence to the Faith of the Seven. Because Jon had no real interaction with Catelyn, and revered his father Eddard, he was not exposed to the Seven but proudly keeps to the Old Gods, and honors the traditions of his First Men ancestors. When Jon took his vow to become a member of the Night's Watch, he chose to do so in front of a heart tree, sacred to the Old Gods.\n\nJon is also fairly shy around women, and as he revealed to Samwell, he was a virgin when he joined the Night's Watch. While he was attractive enough, as a bastard son with nothing to inherit he had no realistic marriage prospects with noblewomen. Jon was even wary of having sex with random girls or prostitutes (as Theon did), because he was terrified of fathering a bastard of his own: having lived his life as a bastard, he felt that it wasn't a life another child should have to go through.\n\nHowever, death has changed Jon. Despite his honorable convictions and previous commitment to the Night's Watch, his experience of being murdered by his own men and then revived has made Jon far more cynical and nihilistic. No longer believing in himself and his ability to face the coming threat, due to being murdered for doing what he thought was right - Jon abandons the Night's Watch, despite knowing full well how dangerous the threat looming beyond the Wall really is. He loses his determination about fighting and becomes much more lonely and melancholic only speaking when he hasn't any other choice. Also, Jon feels remorse for hanging his former steward Olly, even though the latter did murder both him and the woman he loved. While he is wary of conflict since his return, his love for his family has brought him back into the fight.

She proves herself by winning a tournament amongst his men, including a victory over Renly's favorite Ser Loras Tyrell. She asks to be named to his Kingsguard as a reward. Renly grants her request, despite her gender and consequent lack of knighthood. Lady Catelyn Stark arrives in the camp to negotiate an alliance between Renly and her son, King Robb Stark. Brienne takes offense when Lady Catelyn doesn't refer to Renly as \"Your Grace\", and later, escorts her and Renly through the camp as they talk.

Brienne demands that Jaime look her in the eye and say that Sansa is safe in King's Landing; Jaime is unable to do so.","Podrick then questions Brienne about her past with Renly Baratheon. She reveals that as a young girl, her father held a ball and invited dozens of young lords in order to find a good match for her.

Before she could run away, Renly took Brienne into his arms and told her that those \"nasty little shits aren't worth crying over\" and danced with her. Brienne also acknowledges that Renly was only interested in men, but it didn't stop her from loving him. She says that there is nothing more hateful than failing to protect the ones you love, and intends to avenge Renly by killing Stannis Baratheon, whom she believes played a role in Renly's murder due to Melisandre's Shadow resembling Stannis.","Brienne, Podrick, and Sansa arrive at Castle Black, where Sansa and Jon are reunited. Brienne notices Tormund Giantsbane gazing at her admirably, which makes her visibly uncomfortable. Later, Brienne confronts Davos Seaworth and Melisandre, having previously met them in the Stormlands during Renly and Stannis' parley. Having overheard Davos ask Melisandre what exactly happened at Stannis' camp after he left, Brienne openly admits that she found and killed Stannis after he admitted to murdering Renly with blood magic. Though she admits it is in the past, she claims she will never forgive Melisandre for her role in Renly's death. Brienne later shares a meal with Jon, Sansa, Podrick, Tormund and Eddison Tollett, during which Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton demanding Sansa back on threat of harming him and his friends, and displays obvious anger when Ramsay mentions letting his soldiers rape Sansa one by one.","Some time later, Brienne is going through a vigorous sword practice session with Podrick, knocking him down when he overextends himself. Impressed, Arya interrupts and says she'd like to spar with Brienne - the woman who beat the Hound in combat. Brienne goes easy on her at first, but then Arya completely outmaneuvers Brienne using the Water Dance training she received from Syrio Forel, augmented by her training with the Faceless Men. Arya achieves many openings that would be a killing blow if she wanted them to be. Surprised that such a young girl is so skilled, Brienne stops holding back, leading to a grueling sparring session. Brienne actually manages to knock Needle out of Arya's hand but she simply switches to the Valyrian steel dagger she had in her belt. Arya uses her speed and agility to compensate for Brienne's strength and size to overwhelm her - until Brienne actually manages to bring her brute strength to bear on a fast moving target by landing a kick on Arya's chest that sends her falling down. Ultimately, they reach a stalemate, with each of them holding a blade at the others' throat. Arya takes her leave of Brienne, both mutually impressed.","On the Season 3 Blu-ray, Brienne narrates the Histories & Lore video \"The Stormlands\".","There is widespread speculation that Brienne of Tarth is a descendant of the famous knight Duncan the Tall, who eventually rose to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard under his friend King Aegon V Targaryen. Ser Duncan (\"Dunk\") and Aegon \"Egg\" Targaryen are the two main characters in the \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" prequel novellas, which start about 90 years before Game of Thrones begins. George R.R. Martin has stated that, with time-jumps in between each story, he intends for the prequel novellas to cover the entire lives of Dunk and Egg, up until about 50 years ago. There are three pieces of evidence that Brienne might be Duncan's descendant. First, Martin actually said that a descendant of Duncan would appear in the fourth novel, but he never indicated who it was. Second, during the fourth novel, Brienne mentions in passing while selecting a new shield that she recalls an old shield from her youth which was present in her family's armory at Evenfall Hall, and the description she gives matches Ser Duncan's personal sigil (a green shooting star over a green elm tree, on a sunset-orange field). Third, though most general, is that \"Ser Duncan the Tall\" was famously a very tall man, nearly seven feet in height, and Brienne is unusually tall for a woman by Westeros standards. There is also speculation that Hodor may be a descendant of Ser Duncan, as Hodor is also extremely tall, over seven feet in height, and the upcoming fourth prequel novella, The She-Wolves of Winterfell, reveals that Ser Duncan traveled to Winterfell. At one point Bran Stark has a greensight vision of the past, and sees a very large man \"as tall as Hodor\" in the Winterfell godswood, being kissed by a slender young woman - who might have been Old Nan."],"name":"Brienne of Tarth","description":"Brienne has spent most of her life as the object of scorn, rejection and \u2013 at best \u2013 pity. When she tried to dress and act like a proper lady, she was met with mockery and disdain for her unattractive appearance and lack of feminine social graces; when she turned to a career more suited to her talents as a warrior, she received only contempt and resentment for her gender despite her considerable skill. Her lifetime of scorn and condescension led her to becoming extremely pragmatic and blunt. However, it has also provided her with nerves of Valyrian steel, and she is completely unafraid to face off against warriors as powerful or as intimidating as Jaime Lannister (arguably the best sword in the realm), Loras Tyrell (a renowned warrior) and even Sandor Clegane (a physically brutal and extremely intimidating person with an infamous temper).\n\nPerhaps because of this background, Brienne is as awkward in personality as she is in appearance; Catelyn Stark notices that she has none of the easy confidence of some other warrior women. She yearns for respect and acceptance from others, and easily gives her love and loyalty to the few people who treat her with any degree of genuine courtesy. Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark, and Jaime Lannister are among those who have won Brienne's friendship and service in this manner. Brienne, much like Ned Stark, is motivated by her own sense of honour and duty, thus seeing most dishonourable acts as unacceptable. She often faces situations where her honour is eclipsed and opposed by her heart, since she confessed to Jaime that her failure to sway the Blackfish would result in the two of them fighting one another again, saying so in a tone that states outright she doesn't want to fight him - even though she has a considerable chance of defeating him.\n\nShe can be headstrong, sarcastic, cynical and judgmental, but she is also honest, straightforward, loyal, and determined. Although she has received extremely poor treatment from most knights, Brienne clings to a naïvely idealized concept of knighthood. Despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 the fact that she has no expectation of ever being recognized by society for her accomplishments and strength of character, she nevertheless strives to live up to the ideal of a true knight at all times. Brienne adheres to the expectations and guidelines of knighthood almost formally, since she expressed at the climax of her fight with the Hound that she had no wish to kill him (which he ignored and continued to fight her), and also carried out the killing of Stannis Baratheon as if it were an official execution, even permitting him any last words.\n\nBrienne has proven herself to be one of the strongest fighters in Westeros, albeit the most underrated. In combat, she relies on a combination of her intimidating size, strength, and unrelenting brute force to win most fights. This unrelenting style is what allowed her to defeat Loras Tyrell and Sandor Clegane, two of the greatest swordsmen in the realm. She could fight three men at the same time, beat two armoured soldiers in a confined space and hold her ground against Jaime Lannister. Even after she was presented with a prominent disadvantage, such as being disarmed, she would resort brutally to continue fighting, shown when she proceeded to fight the Hound even after he'd ridden her of her sword. Jaime confessed that he considered her a good fighter, even before they became friends.\n\nBrienne of Tarth is extremely noble and humble at all times, as evidenced by her confessing at several points that she was not a knight, and at one point not even a lady - even though she was inevitably a lady of Tarth as the only daughter of Lord Selwyn Tarth. This was probably motivated by her self-induced belief that she was inferior to the standards of a true knight, given that she has faced being underrated and underappreciated for her appearance and gender her whole life. The irony of the entire situation is that she exemplifies the qualities of a true knight: She is a strong and skilled fighter, is merciful and compassionate, unshakably loyal and determined, and takes her duties as a warrior sworn to a higher authority extremely seriously. The only reason she isn't viewed as such by the people of the Seven Kingdoms is because she is a woman.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Brienne_of_Tarth"}}

At the time, they did plan on giving the backstory about Tysha in Season 2, in the event that the show was renewed. As it happened, because the runtime of Season 1 came up short, they realized it was a great scene to put back in (also because it was a small, intimate scene only involving a few characters and wouldn't take much more time to set up). Cogman is also convinced that Dinklage's emotional performance in this Tysha backstory scene is what won him his Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in Season 1.","A slight difference is that, due to some characters being aged-up in the TV series, Tyrion was 13 years old when he encountered Tysha in the books, but in the TV series he states that he was 16 years old.","In the books, as Jaime is helping Tyrion escape from the dungeons of the Red Keep, fearing he will never see Tyrion again and overcome by guilt, he finally reveals to him the truth: Tysha was not really a whore, and the entire incident with the rapers was entirely true. After Tywin found out that Tyrion had married a commoner, he was furious - in part because Tywin's own father Tytos Lannister, after Tywin's mother died, took a live-in mistress who was a commoner. Tytos treated the woman as Lady of Casterly Rock in all but name, gave her Tywin's mother's jewelry, and Tywin came to think of her as only a step above a common whore. When Tywin learned that Tyrion married a commoner, his reasoning was that no one could ever love Tyrion, and Tysha must only be after his wealth - just as Tytos's mistress was after his wealth - and because she was presumably only having sex with him for money, that essentially made her a \"whore\". In truth, she truly was just an innocent crofter's daughter who was attacked by rapers, but saved by Tyrion and Jaime on the road."],"name":"Tysha","description":"When Tyrion Lannister was sixteen years old, he met an orphaned wheelwright's daughter on the road, apparently the victim of an attempted rape. While his brother, Jaime, rode off after the attackers, Tyrion helped Tysha recover from the ordeal, and they became lovers. They found a drunk septon willing to marry them in exchange for a bribe and briefly, they lived as husband and wife for two weeks, until Tyrion's father Lord Tywin learned what had happened when the septon told him after he had sobered up. Jaime confessed that he organized the incident to do something nice for his little brother, and Tysha was actually a prostitute. Jaime thought it was time that Tyrion had sex with a girl, and paid Tysha and the would-be rapers to pretend it was real so Tyrion would think a girl genuinely wanted to have sex with him without having to pay for it. However, Jaime did not anticipate that Tyrion would marry the girl, nor what their father's reaction would be to that. In a fury that his son would dare to marry a commoner, Tywin had his guards gang-rape Tysha while Tyrion was forced to watch. Tywin sarcastically had the guards pay Tysha by dropping a silver coin in her hand for each man who took her. By the end, there were so many silver coins that the pile was slipping out of her hand and coins were rolling along the floor. She was then sent on her way, and Tyrion never heard of her again.\n\nSince this incident, Tyrion has disdained love and romance in favor of liaisons with prostitutes for money.\n\nAt the Lannister battle camp, prior to the Battle of the Green Fork, Tyrion Lannister is playing a drinking game with Bronn and Shae, when Bronn mentions that he overheard while playing dice with some Lannister guardsmen that Tyrion was married once. Tyrion then explains the story of his marriage to Tysha. Bronn comments \"I would have killed the man who did that to me\".\n\nPrior to the Battle of the Blackwater, Tyrion's sister Cersei intends to take petty revenge on Tyrion, by capturing the new whore that he has fallen in love with and taken to King's Landing with him. For a moment Tyrion thinks that she has captured his lover Shae, though it is quickly revealed that she captured the wrong whore, mistaking that Ros was his lover.

He was the father of Ramsay Bolton, his legitimized bastard, and an unnamed newborn baby from his wife, Walda Frey.","Although torture is outlawed in the North, his family is famous for flaying the skin from their enemies as a means of torture and execution. Roose fought for Lord Eddard Stark in the civil war against House Targaryen known as Robert's Rebellion and proved his worth as a soldier in the Battle of the Trident. He advised Robert Baratheon to execute Ser Barristan Selmy, a legendary Kingsguard sworn to the Targaryens, but Robert overruled Roose and pardoned Selmy.","House Bolton banners are present among Robb Stark's forces as they assemble at Winterfell and march south to fight House Lannister following the imprisonment and execution of Lord Eddard Stark. Robb is proclaimed King in the North by his bannermen following the death of Eddard, although Roose is not present.","Roose fights for King Robb Stark in his decisive victory at the Battle of Oxcross. The following morning Roose reports that they killed five Lannister men for every casualty they suffered. He expresses concern over the volume of prisoners they have taken, saying that they are struggling to feed their own men. Robb insists that the prisoners be treated well and rejects Roose\u2019s suggestion that they torture the officers, reminding him that the Boltons' traditional practice of flaying their enemies is outlawed in the North. Roose warns Robb that the high road is pretty but difficult. Robb counters that he is treating his prisoners as he hopes the Lannisters will treat his sisters.","After killing Robb, Roose climbs to the top of The Twins and watches the massacre of the Stark forces. The next day, he and Walder Frey gloat over the deaths of the Starks and the capture of Edmure Tully, though Roose is wary about the escape of Brynden Tully, concerned that he will reach the safety of Riverrun before he can be found. Walder comments that it must have been difficult following Robb Stark, and Roose notes that Robb never once listened to his advice. Walder jokingly raises a toast to the Young Wolf, and Roose says that he will now be forever young. Roose then explains to Walder what really happened at the Sack of Winterfell: it was actually Roose's bastard son Ramsay Snow, leading a force of Bolton soldiers, who burned Winterfell to the ground. Roose falsely reported to Robb that Theon and the ironborn were responsible to deflect suspicion from the Boltons - while Ramsay captured Theon and has been sadistically torturing him in the Dreadfort's dungeon. Roose decided to betray Robb long ago, after the Lannisters defeated Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of the Blackwater, and was simply feigning loyalty this entire time, even as he was plotting the Starks' destruction.","Later, Roose and his army meet Ramsay near Moat Cailin where Ramsay presents him with the fortress's flag. Roose instructs Ramsay to walk with him, and they climb a hill. He asks if there has been any word from Locke, who was killed in his attempt to abscond with Bran, and Ramsay answers that there has been nothing. Roose dismisses this as unimportant, speculating that the Stark boys are most likely dead. At the top of the hill, Roose points out that the north is larger than all of the other kingdoms combined, and that, thanks to Ramsay's actions, he now has control of it. He then hands Ramsay a document, legitimizing him as Ramsay Bolton. After Ramsay swears to honor him and uphold his traditions, Roose leads his forces towards Winterfell, moving his base of operations to the ruined fortress.","Roose Bolton's hold on the North is opposed by the remaining Northern lords, most of whom lost sons and men at the Red Wedding. While scolding Ramsay for needlessly flaying a Northern lord, along with his wife and brother, alive for refusing to pay their taxes, Roose points out that they do not have enough men to rule the North should the Stark bannermen rise against them, reminding Ramsay that the pact they made was with Tywin Lannister, who is now dead, meaning that the Lannisters will likely no longer support them. He tells Ramsay that the best way to strengthen their hold is not by flaying people and subsequently enraging their loved ones, but by marrying into good families. He has arranged with Petyr Baelish to have Ramsay marry Sansa Stark.","Though Roose congratulates Ramsay for his victory over Stannis Baratheon, he reminds him that they have effectively betrayed the Lannisters by marrying Ramsay to Sansa Stark, who Ramsay allowed to escape.  Roose reminds Ramsay that they cannot defend themselves without support from the other Northern houses, who will only do so if they have Sansa, whom Ramsay drove away with his abuse. Ramsay insists that he has men searching for Sansa and Theon, while Roose reminds him that without Sansa, he cannot produce an heir to the North, and subtly warns him that if it comes to be, he will disinherit him in favor of his unborn son with Walda.","Spoken about Roose","In the television series, Roose expresses disgust at Ramsay's suggestion to march on Castle Black and kill Jon Snow, the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, fearing that this will turn all of the Northern Houses against them. At the end of the fifth book, Ramsay does precisely this, sending a letter to Jon, signing it as the \"Trueborn Lord of Winterfell\", and threatening him with death if his demands are not met. Given Roose's reaction in the television series, this appears to imply that by the end of the fifth book, Ramsay has either written the letter without telling Roose, or he has already killed him \"off-page\" like how Euron Greyjoy killed Balon Greyjoy in A Storm of Swords."],"name":"Roose Bolton","description":"Roose Bolton is cautious, intelligent, ruthless, and easily capable of unspeakable cruelty. He has a very calm and calculating personality, never publicly expressing anger, happiness, or sadness. Politically astute, he frequently offered the most pragmatic advice to Robb Stark, albeit the most ruthless, such as recommending that they put prisoners to the sword because they were having difficulty feeding them all. However, despite his ruthlessness, Roose appears to follow a code of honor to a certain degree since he frequently opposes the needless, cruel deeds performed by Ramsay and his men, and outright shoots down Ramsay's suggestion to murder Jon Snow, since Jon is both a bastard and the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He appears genuinely shocked and saddened upon seeing the massacred Northmen at Gregor Clegane's hands at Harrenhal, hinting that he abhors needless violence and cruelty, and seems to do his best to offer his condolences to Rickard Karstark, referring to him as \"my friend\" and promising that his sons will be avenged.\n\nWhen he realized that Robb Stark had no chance of winning the war, he sought an alliance with House Frey and House Lannister. Roose's cold realism clashed with Robb's idealism. When all seemed lost, he did not attempt to fight for a losing cause and instead decided to safeguard his family's future by turning on his king. Similar to Tywin, Roose valued the legacy of House Bolton as something bigger than himself.\n\nRoose was a cunning strategist, both on and off the battlefield. His betrayal was sudden and unexpected, and it resulted in the utter decimation of the rebellious Northern lords and their armies while his own forces remained basically intact. This would allow House Bolton to overpower the now defenseless home territories of these other Houses in the North, ensuring Bolton rule.\n\nUnlike Robb Stark, he believed that he wasn't a lord to indulge his own petty whims and that strengthening his House was his first priority: in that context, he married Walda Frey to guarantee his alliance with House Frey. As a result, Roose was somewhat critical of Ramsay's more wild or shocking actions, because as Roose's only heir, Ramsay represents the future of House Bolton. Roose did enjoy sadistically toying with other people - as seen when he briefly taunted Jaime Lannister that King's Landing might have fallen to Stannis Baratheon - but a major difference between him and Ramsay is that Roose had caution enough to only partake in such amusements when he thinks he can get away with it. Roose was also cautious enough to realize that, despite his success in elevating House Bolton as a Great House of Westeros, this position is fragile and that only proper alliances would allow him to retain his power. This was the main reason behind his decision to marry Sansa to Ramsay and his willingness to consider an alliance with Littlefinger and the Lords of the Vale after Tywin's death.\n\nDespite his cruelty, he did have some form of affection for his children, and seemed pleased and possibly happy when his new son's birth was announced by Maester Wolkan. He also seemed to care for Ramsay to an extent, but overall mistrusted him.\n\nFor all his caution while dealing with his enemies, Roose ironically fails to see the threats to his claim (or even his life) right in front of him. Despite knowing of Ramsay's impulsiveness and insanity, Roose frequently mistreats Ramsay by reminding him of his bastard status and implying that he will disinherit him despite his legitimization by publicly announcing that he is expecting a trueborn child, right in Ramsay's face, all of which ultimately led to Roose's death by his own son's hands. This also somewhat echoes Tywin's fate, as he was also killed by his own son, though Roose's case is more extreme, as he knew what kind of person Ramsay was but made no attempt to protect himself. However, Ramsay's unwillingness to follow Roose's cautious and practical advice ultimately led to his own downfall not long afterward, as well as House Bolton's extinction. In a twisted sense of irony, Roose's actions to elevate House Bolton's status and legacy instead led to its annihilation.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roose_Bolton"}}

Upon hearing this, his daughter Queen Alicent Hightower, Viserys's wife, ordered that the servant who first saw him dead be put in the Black Cells. Otto then summoned a Small Council meeting, and he demanded that Aegon II Targaryen would be King. However, the small council members were confused, as they had been demanded by Viserys that they must swear fealty to his eldest child Rhaenyra Targaryen. The Master of Coin, Lyman Beesbury, declared this as treason, only to have his throat cut open by Ser Criston Cole, who had previously pointed out that a son comes before a daughter, despite the sucession that the dead king had refused to change. This ended the debate at dawn.\n\nWhen the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons broke out between Aegon and Rhaenyra, Otto used diplomacy to further the interests of the Greens, but although this had not been entirely without success, Aegon had little patience for strategy. One of Otto's final acts as Hand was to build an alliance with the Triarchy across the Narrow Sea, old enemies of Rhaenyra's husband Daemon, but by then, Aegon had grown tired of letting others fight his war for him.\n\nWith his eldest son, Jaehaerys, dead, Aegon was losing in the war. Daemon had managed to capture Harrenhal, while Rhaenyra's son Jacaerys had recruited House Stark of Winterfell, House Arryn of The Eyrie and the other houses of The Vale of Arryn for Rhaenyra. Furious, Aegon dismissed Otto, and appointed Lord Commander Criston Cole as his new Hand.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Otto_Hightower"}}

Before she passed away, she begged her brother Ned to promise her to keep her son safe out of fear that her formerly betrothed, Robert Baratheon, would have him killed if he ever found out the truth that his father was Rhaegar; this led to Ned raising his nephew as his own bastard son, Jon Snow.","When Robert says that Lyanna would never have opposed him vehemently as Cersei does, Ned notes that Robert either overlooked or had forgotten Lyanna's iron will. It is also implied she was not as passionate about her betrothal as Robert was."],"name":"Lyanna Stark","description":"Lyanna Stark was the only daughter of Lord Rickard Stark, head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rule the region from their seat of Winterfell and Rickard also held the title Lord of Winterfell.\n\nLyanna had three brothers, Brandon, Eddard, and Benjen Stark. Her father arranged a betrothal between her and Robert Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands.\n\nSome time after the betrothal, Lord Walter Whent organized a great tourney at Harrenhal, in which Lyanna saved Howland Reed from a group of squires. Later, she took him to their tent, where she introduced him to her three brothers. Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the heir to the Iron Throne, was the victor. Afterwards, the Prince rode past his wife, Princess Elia Martell, and placed a crown of winter roses, the crown of the Queen of Love and Beauty, on Lyanna's lap. This action was considered an outrage by many because not only was Rhaegar married but Lyanna was already betrothed to another man. At some point after these events, Lyanna was supposedly abducted by Rhaegar, who took her south and hid her away in Dorne. In reality, Lyanna had willingly eloped with Rhaegar and married him in a secret ceremony (the High Septon had also secretly annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia Martell). Brandon, who had been on his way to Riverrun to wed Catelyn Tully, instead went to King's Landing to demand Rhaegar's arrest and punishment. Unaware of Rhaegar's new marriage, King Aerys II Targaryen had him and all his companions charged with treason. He demanded all their fathers, including Lord Rickard Stark, come to King's Landing and promised they would receive a fair trial. Instead the King had them all burned alive, except for Brandon, who strangled himself trying to save his father.\n\nThis incident sparked the uprising known as Robert's Rebellion. Jon Arryn was commanded to arrest and turn over his wards Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark, but he refused. The three of them rose in rebellion along with Hoster Tully of Riverrun after Eddard and Jon married his daughters, Catelyn and Lysa. The war saw House Targaryen almost completely destroyed and Robert installed as king after he personally slew Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident. During the war Lyanna died of then-unknown causes in Eddard's arms, after her rescue. As per her request, she was buried next to her brother Brandon in the crypts at Winterfell. Robert continued to mourn her despite becoming king and marrying Cersei Lannister. Though Eddard was angered at Robert for refusing to hold Tywin Lannister and his army accountable for the Sack of King's Landing, their friendship was rekindled over the mutual grief for Lyanna.\n\nLyanna's death, in reality, was from complications from giving birth to her son with Rhaegar. Her death was witnessed by Ned and two handmaidens and most likely Howland Reed. Before her death, Lyanna begged Ned to promise to keep her baby safe from Robert, who would have had the child killed if he found out Rhaegar was his father. Remembering how the Lannisters had already brutally murdered Rhaegar's two children with Elia Martell, Ned complied with Lyanna's wish and took the infant to Winterfell, claiming the boy was his bastard son and naming him Jon Snow. Few knew the truth of Jon's parentage, with Ned, Howland and the two handmaidens being the only individuals bearing the knowledge.\n\nKing Robert Baratheon visits Lyanna's tomb under Winterfell almost immediately after arriving. As part of their romance, he would bring her feathers from an exotic southern bird. During this visit, he places one in the hand of her statue. Robert says the statue doesn't do her justice. He becomes emotional and tells Eddard how he relives killing Rhaegar Targaryen again and again in his dreams for what he did to Lyanna. He asks Eddard if it was necessary to bury Lyanna in a cold tomb rather than somewhere in the sunlight, but Eddard responds that she was of the North and of House Stark; this is her place.\n\nWhile departing Winterfell, Jon Snow asks Eddard about his mother, still unaware of her identity, and as to whether or not she is alive or knows about him. Still unprepared to tell Jon the truth about Lyanna and Rhaegar, Eddard merely promises that the next time they meet, they will talk about Jon's mother.\n\nIn King's Landing, Robert shares a drink with his wife, Cersei Lannister, and they begin to talk about Lyanna Stark for the first time in their marriage. Robert tells her how much Lyanna meant to him, even though now he cannot even remember her face, saying she was the only thing he ever wanted but then someone took her away from him, and even the entire Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left. Cersei reminds him that she once had feelings for him, which he acknowledges. She asks if there had ever been even a moment when he had loved her but Robert says no. He asks her if that makes her feel better or worse. Cersei replies it doesn't make her feel anything.\n\nWhen Eddard discovers that Cersei has been having an incestuous affair with her twin brother Jaime, he confronts her. Cersei denies Eddard's accusation that she always hated Robert, saying she once worshipped him back when he was young and handsome and muscular. All the girls wanted him, and he was hers by oath. But then that love turned to hate on their wedding night when he came to bed drunk, and afterwards muttered Lyanna's name in her ear. Bran Stark shows Osha the tombs under Winterfell and gives a quick summary of the events leading to the civil war: how Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna, who was betrothed to Robert Baratheon, and the Mad King then killed Lyanna's brother and father, triggering the war.\n\nWhen speaking to her daughter-in-law Talisa Stark, Catelyn Stark confesses her guilt over not being a mother to Jon Snow, and even praying for his death \"all because [she] was jealous of his mother\", not knowing that Jon was Eddard's nephew and not his son, his mother being Lyanna.\n\nWhen speaking to Tyrion Lannister, Oberyn Martell expresses anger that, despite his sister Elia's love and loyalty for her husband Rhaegar Targaryen, he ended up leaving her for \"another woman\", Lyanna Stark.\n\nSansa Stark, upon returning to Winterfell after being gone for four years, visits her aunt's statue and lights a candle in the statue's hand to honor Lyanna as her father used to do. Petyr Baelish finds her there. They discuss what happened at the Tourney of Harrenhal where Rhaegar Targaryen shocked everyone present by passing over his wife Elia Martell in order to crown Lyanna as the Queen of Love and Beauty. Sansa notes how Rhaegar later kidnapped and raped Lyanna, while Petyr said his choices led to the deaths of thousands.\n\nWhile exploring his Greensight under the tutelage of the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran Stark views an event from his father's past, and sees Lyanna showing off her riding skills in front of her brothers, Eddard  and Benjen. She later encourages a young Benjen to fight a bout against the young stablehand Wylis, giving Wylis tips on how to beat her brother.\n\nIn yet another vision, Bran witnesses another event, this time during the aftermath of Robert's Rebellion, in which Ned Stark, accompanied by five bannermen including Howland Reed, confront Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Gerold Hightower of the Kingsguard before the Tower of Joy, in the Red Mountains of Dorne. Before the fight ensues, Ned demands to know where Lyanna is. After the battle, Ned and Bran hear Lyanna scream from inside the tower. Ned hurries inside, but Bran is pulled out of the vision before he can pursue.\n\nMuch later, after becoming the new Three-Eyed Raven following his predecessor's death, Bran returns to the Tower of Joy vision and watches as his young father reunites with the dying Lyanna, who is lying in a bed of blood, which is later revealed to be caused by the aftereffects of childbirth. Lyanna reveals her struggle to be brave in the face of death, prompting Ned to order the handmaidens to aid his sister. However, Lyanna stops him and whispers to him about her ordeal. As Ned takes in this revelation, a handmaiden places a newborn child into his arms. It is revealed that Lyanna gave birth to a baby boy, whose father is Rhaegar, and she beseeches Ned to promise to keep her son safe, fearing that Robert will surely have the boy killed if he finds out. Ned sadly complies with Lyanna's wish and holds his newborn nephew, who Bran immediately realizes is his \"half-brother\" Jon Snow.\n\nWhile reading the journal of High Septon Maynard, who was known for recording every minor detail of his life, Gilly reads aloud to Samwell Tarly that Maynard issued an annulment for \"Prince Ragger,\" who remarried at a secret ceremony in Dorne. This alludes to Lyanna, whom Rhaegar had married after Maynard annulled the marriage between Rhaegar and Elia Martell, though Samwell and Gilly don't realize this at the time.\n\nUpon his arrival at Winterfell, Samwell goes to see Bran, who shares his knowledge of Jon's true parentage with Sam, explaining that Jon Snow is actually Jon Sand as he was born in Dorne. Realizing now how important Gilly's discovery is, Sam tells Bran that Rhaegar and Lyanna were wed, and Jon is indeed legitimate. At Sam's encouragement, Bran wargs into the past to see the wedding for himself. He confirms that it did happen and that Rhaegar was in love with Lyanna and she was in love with him. Bran then flashes forward to Lyanna's death, and hears Jon's birth name, whispered to Ned Stark with Lyanna's dying breath: Aegon Targaryen, the same as his half-brother.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lyanna_Stark"}}

Immensely rich and powerful, Illyrio is an ally and benefactor to Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen. He lives in a great manse in the city, guarded by Unsullied.\n\nIllyrio brokers the deal to \"sell\" Daenerys in marriage to Khal Drogo of the Dothraki. Drogo desires an exotic wife from far away and Viserys needs a Dothraki army to help retake the Seven Kingdoms, so a bargain is made. Illyrio is present when Daenerys says that she doesn't want to marry him. Viserys says she will, and that he would let Drogo's men and all their horses rape her if it meant that in return he could get an army to help him retake the Iron Throne. When Drogo comes to approve of Daenerys, he rides up to the steps, looks her over, and then rides off. Viserys is concerned as Drogo had not said a word nor had he even dismounted. However, Illyrio assures him that if Drogo had not approved, he would have made it known.\n\nIllyrio hosts the wedding and gifts Daenerys with three dragon eggs, turned to stone by the passing of ages. He introduces them to Ser Jorah Mormont, a Westorosi lord in exile and a spy for Varys who then takes service with Viserys. Khal Drogo immediately leaves with his khalasar for Vaes Dothrak, to present Daenerys before the dosh khaleen, and see if the omens are right for war. Ser Jorah tells Viserys that he should stay at Magister Illyrio's estate, as he has been invited to do, until after Khal Drogo returns from the sacred city, but Viserys says he will stay with the khalasar until he gets his army.\n\nSome months later, Illyrio pays a secret visit to King's Landing where he discusses their mutual plans with his ally, Varys, the Spymaster at King Robert's small council. Varys informs him of how the new Hand of the King, Eddard Stark, now has the same genealogy book that his predecessor read, and has met Robert's bastard son Gendry; the same evidence which led Jon Arryn to discover the truth about Queen Cersei's children. Illyrio suggests the possibility that the same fate may befall Lord Stark as did his predecessor, but Varys states Eddard Stark is not the same man as Arryn was. Furthermore, he assures Illyrio that the conflict between the Lannisters and the Starks will soon escalate into a civil war. Illyrio protests that a war will not serve their purpose right now, since Khal Drogo is not yet ready to send his army of Dothraki to invade Westeros for Viserys, thus reviving the Targaryen Dynasty. However, Varys protests there is no way of delaying the incoming conflict, so the Dothraki must be urged to move faster, since \"this is no longer a game for two players.\" Illyrio replies that it never was. Their discussion is overheard by Arya Stark, who is with them in the tunnels under the Red Keep. Arya tries to warn her father about what she heard, but she doesn't know who the speakers were and out of context all she understood was that her father \"has found the bastard\", that \"the wolves are fighting the lions\", and \"something about the savage.\" Despite their secret conversation, later at a small council meeting Varys seemingly supports King Robert's proposal to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen because of the threat her pregnancy and the possibility of a son poses. This information was presumably brought to Varys by Illyrio, who placed Jorah Mormont with the Targaryens and visited Varys on the same day Varys brought this information to the small council.\n\nThe Spice King, a Qartheen merchant, is acquainted with Illyrio, considering him a shrewd man.\n\nAfter crossing the Narrow Sea, Varys and Tyrion Lannister have settled at Illyrio's home in Pentos, and Varys reveals he is a colleague of Illyrio, both from a group of people seeking a Targaryen restoration.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Illyrio_Mopatis"}}

Daenerys then declares her identity, listing off her many titles. Moro, however, simply laughs in response, stating that he will still bed her and she will give him a son. Daenerys firmly turns him down, declaring that she will not bear him or anyone else's children. Intrigued, Moro states that he likes that she has spirit, but his obvious lustful intentions are immediately dashed when she reveals that she is Khal Drogo's widow. Moro humbly apologizes for his behavior, for it is forbidden in Dothraki tradition to bed a Khal's widow. He then cuts her free of her restraints and gives his word that nobody will harm her.

Moro's conciliatory attitude ends, however, when Daenerys declares that none of the Khals are fit to lead the Dothraki, but she is. Moro threatens to have the khals gang-rape Daenerys for her insolence; in response, Dany overturns the braziers, setting the entire Temple ablaze. Moro is one of the few to make it to the door of the Temple, only to find the doors barred from the outside.

He encountered so much resistance from the Great Houses over the years trying to enact reforms that would benefit the smallfolk that he came to believe that the only way to bring them all in line again was to enforce royal power with new dragons. These last two weaknesses culminated in 259 AL at the so-called \"Tragedy at Summerhall\".

This was confirmed on 18 August 2012 when it was announced he would be played by Dan Hildebrand..","In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Kraznys is one of the \"Good Masters\", the heads of the noble and wealthy slave-trading families, of the city of Astapor, dwelling in an immense pyramid. He is described as having an oiled red and black beard and being so fat that Daenerys thinks he has bigger breasts than hers. He is disdainful for anyone not born of Ghiscari blood and considers his people and heritage to be superior to anyone else's, even that of Valyria, while dismissing the Westerosi as \"sunset savages\"."],"name":"Kraznys mo Nakloz","description":"Kraznys mo Nakloz is one of the Good Masters, the ruling elite of the city of Astapor, composed of slave traders. As with many of his compatriots, Kraznys only speaks a Low Valyrian dialect and does not know the Common Tongue of Westeros. Thus when dealing with foreign customers, Kraznys relies on his slave Missandei to serve as his translator.\n\nKraznys, with Missandei at his side, meets with Daenerys Targaryen and shows her some of his Unsullied. These Unsullied had been standing for an entire day without being given food or water. Through Missandei, Kraznys explains the Unsullied are trained to fight from the age of five and that only one in four recruits survives the training. To demonstrate that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death, he slices off the nipple of one soldier in the presence of his prospective customers. He then adds that the Unsullied are also trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training. Kraznys tells her that eight thousand soldiers are for sale and that she has one day until the next day to make a decision. Throughout the meeting, Kraznys insults Daenerys, believing that she doesn't understand Valyrian. Missandei translates Kraznys insult-laden sentences into more respectable phrases.\n\nThe following day, Daenerys meets with Kraznys and two other Good Masters, Greizhen mo Ullhor being one of the other two. Kraznys is initially dismissive of her offer to buy all eight thousand Unsullied and the boys in training, claiming that she can afford barely more than one hundred Unsullied. In response, Daenerys states that she has dragons. After some haggling, Kraznys reluctantly agrees to sell her all of his Unsullied in return for Drogon. In addition, Daenerys demands to have Missandei as a token. Eager to possess a dragon of his own, Kraznys agrees. He also agrees to let Daenerys have Missandei as a gift.\n\nKraznys and his fellow Good Masters are present at one of Astapor's plazas to consummate the transaction and see the dragon for themselves. All the Unsullied soldiers are also assembled. Daenerys and her entourage arrive with Drogon in a cage. Kraznys tells Daenerys that the Unsullied had not seen combat before and advises her to \"blood them early\" by having them attack some minor cities and towns before proceeding to Westeros. He offers to purchase any healthy slaves that she may capture and some of these would even be trained as Unsullied. Daenerys hands Drogon, who is wearing a long chain leash, to Kraznys, who gives her a scourge with a harpy-shaped hilt, signifying ownership of the Unsullied. This symbolic gesture concludes the transaction.\n\nWhile Kraznys struggles to control Drogon, Daenerys addresses the Unsullied in Valyrian and tests them with battle commands. Kraznys then complains to Daenerys that the dragon is not obeying his commands. In response, Daenerys retorts in perfect Valyrian that \"a dragon is not a slave\". Kraznys is surprised that Daenerys speaks Valyrian, Daenerys declares that she is Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria: Valyrian is her mother-tongue, and thus she has understood every word he said to her.\n\nDaenerys orders the Unsullied to kill all of the Good Masters in Astapor, along with all of their household soldiers and any man who holds a whip, to spare only the children and to liberate all slaves. As the Unsullied turn on the slave-drivers, Kraznys frantically shouts for someone to kill Daenerys but the Unsullied, no longer his, ignore him. Daenerys turns back to Krazyns and calmly speaks one word: \"dracarys\". Drogon then breathes fire onto Kraznys, completely engulfing the slaver in flames. Following the Sack of Astapor, Kraznys' charred remains are left unburied.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Kraznys_mo_Nakloz"}}

Writer Bryan Cogman, however, subsequently did an interview with Westeros.org, and specifically addressed this concern: changes in adaptation meant that Loras had to have sex with Olyvar, to let it slip that he would marry Sansa, as part of the plot mechanics of the Lannister\/Tyrell rivalry. However, Cogman explained, his earlier drafts of the episode actually included longer scenes which made it explicitly clear that Loras is not finished mourning Renly. Rather, Loras was very depressed and lonely, and in effect \"drowning his sorrows\" by engaging in casual sex in the hope that it would make himself feel better, but it ultimately made Loras feel more emotionally distraught and reminded of how much he misses Renly.

When Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand arrive in King's Landing, they visit the brothel and Olyvar presents three prostitutes to the couple. After Ellaria chooses one and dismisses the other two, Oberyn turns his attentions to Olyvar. The latter protests that he's not on offer, before giving in and admitting he's just \"wildly expensive\". Oberyn asks if Olyvar has ever been with a prince before, orders him to remove his clothes and grabs him by the crotch. However, they are interrupted when Oberyn overhears a pair of Lannister men singing \"The Rains of Castamere\".\n\nOlyvar later takes part in a small orgy involving Oberyn, Ellaria and two other prostitutes. Ellaria kisses Olyvar, who politely refuses her, claiming to have \"not acquired the taste\" for women. He then presses Oberyn to divulge his own preference. The Prince, however, explains his rather fluid approach to sexuality, a common trait among the Dornish. Olyvar and the other prostitutes depart when Tywin Lannister unexpectedly arrives to speak with Oberyn.\n\nOlyvar continues to see Loras on a regular basis, though it's unclear if their arrangement is personal or professional. Around the time of Tywin Lannister's funeral, Olyvar is cuddling with Loras Tyrell post coitus, discussing the possibility of visiting Dorne or anywhere far away from King's Landing, when Margaery walks in. Staring down Olyvar, she admonishes Loras for making them late for supper with King Tommen, and tells Olyvar to leave.\n\nOlyvar later plays the role of the Father with a fake beard when the High Septon visits the brothel, while a collection of female prostitutes play the rest of the Seven. He breaks character to make a snide remark about the High Septon's choice, and to remind him that two prostitutes will cost him extra. Moments later, the brothel is attacked by Sparrows, led by Lancel Lannister, who seize the High Septon. Olyvar attempts to tell them that they will have to answer to Baelish, but they strike him across the face and remove his fake beard.\n\nOlyvar is present when the brothel is attacked again by the Sparrows, this time having formed into the Faith Militant with Cersei Lannister's permission. Again, he is struck when he tells them they will have to answer to Baelish. Olyvar hears screams coming from another room which he approaches to see the Sparrows have singled out a man having sex with one of the male prostitutes, and approach him with a knife. Olyvar flees as one of the men screams off-screen. (it is heavily implied they are either castrated or killed)\n\nOlyvar is later called to give evidence at the \"Holy Inquest\" of Loras, who is accused of \"fornication\", \"buggery\", and \"blasphemy\", though it is clear he is doing it on Cersei's instructions. Despite their previous, affectionate relationship, Olyvar turns on his lover, and provides the High Sparrow with testimony that allows him to pursue formal charges against Loras, who attempts to attack Olyvar but is restrained. Olyvar's testimony also leads to Margaery's arrest for perjury, despite Loras and Margaery both denouncing Olyvar as a liar.\n\nLater, during a meeting between Lady Olenna and Petyr Baelish, Baelish reveals that Cersei summoned him back to King's Landing for \"a piece of information\" he had, revealing that Cersei forced Baelish to give up Olyvar so she could build up a case against Loras and Margaery.

Karl was eventually sent to the Wall and became a ranger of the Night's Watch. He takes part in the Great Ranging.\n\nHis fighting style favored speed and using small, fast weapons like daggers to quickly stab and deliver killing blows. This style reflected his background in Flea Bottom where he fought in tight, confined spaces and had to use small, easily-concealed weapons to avoid being caught by the City Watch.\n\nKarl survives the White Walkers' attack on the Fist of the First Men, and regroups with his fellow survivors as they attempt to pull back to the Wall.\n\nWhen the Watch arrive at Craster's Keep seeking food and shelter, Karl is openly antagonistic towards Craster, accusing him of giving his pigs better food than them. Along with Rast, he shows an interest in Craster's daughter-wives.\n\nFollowing the death and funeral of Bannen, as tensions between Craster and the brothers of the Watch run higher, Karl insults Craster - calling him \"a daughter-fucking wildling bastard\" - after the wildling demands the Watch to leave his hall and threatens to kill anyone who insults him. Craster charges against Karl with an axe but the black brother easily kills him by quickly closing the distance between them, blocking Craster's attack by grabbing the wrist of his weapon hand, and stabbing him in the throat with a dagger. Lord Commander Mormont threatens to have Karl executed for this, until Rast stabs Mormont in the back, visibly shocking Karl. A brutal fight ensues among the black brothers. Grenn charges at Karl, who is reluctant to kill his fellow brother and ends up tackled by him.\n\nGrenn and Edd arrive at Castle Black after escaping from their captivity at Craster's Keep. They reveal that Karl is the ringleader of the mutineers, and that they are content with staying at the keep, eating Craster's food, and raping his daughter-wives.\n\n\u200BJon Snow then points out that they know about the small garrison at Castle Black and proposes that they should be killed so they won't disclose it to the wildlings.\n\nAt Craster's Keep, Karl drinks wine from the skull of Jeor Mormont, drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in King's Landing before ordering Rast to \"feed the beast\". One of Craster's former wives enters the Keep and presents Karl with Craster's last child, a son. The women call for it to be given to the gods, which Karl realizes must refer to the White Walkers. Realizing that this was how Craster protected himself from the White Walkers, Karl orders Rast to take the child out into the forest, leaving it behind. Soon after, Bran, Jojen, and Meera are captured and taken to Karl, who threatens to kill Meera and Jojen until Bran admits his true identity as Jon Snow's half-brother.\n\nWith his new captives in hand, Karl attempts to rape Meera, but is interrupted when Jon Snow and a handful of the Night's Watch storm Craster's Keep. Karl duels Jon and initially Karl gains the upper hand, because his daggers are better suited to the cramped space inside the building than Jon's sword, and he uses dirty tactics like spitting in Jon's face to distract him. Before he can finish Jon, however, one of Craster's daughter-wives stabs Karl in the shoulder, prompting him to instead motion to kill her. By doing this, however, he neglects one of the principal tenets of combat (never turn your back on an opponent) and pays for this when Jon snatches up Longclaw and drives her through the back of Karl's head, killing him.\n\nKarl's body is later burned along with those of the remaining mutineers and slain brothers inside the Keep to ensure that they cannot come back as Wights.

House Tully rules the region from their seat at Riverrun and Hoster also holds the title Lord of Riverrun.\n\nHoster married Lady Minisa of House Whent. They have three children, two daughters Catelyn and Lysa and a son, Edmure. Only three of their six children survived. Minisa died shortly after bearing their last child, which died with her. Hoster brokered a marriage alliance with House Stark, the ruling house of the North betrothing his eldest daughter Catelyn to their heir Brandon Stark.\n\nHoster fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings where Lord Baelish befriended him and later agreed to foster his son Petyr at Riverrun. When he returned from the war, he arranged a marriage for his brother Brynden to Bethany Redwyne, but Brynden refused causing Hoster to nickname him \"The Blackfish\" and a falling out between the brothers that lasted the rest of Hoster's life.\n\nThe Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had Brandon Stark and his father brutally executed, triggering a rebellion against him. Hoster joined House Stark, House Baratheon and House Arryn in opposing the Mad King. Catelyn married Brandon's brother Eddard Stark and Hoster arranged for Lysa to marry Lord Jon Arryn to solidify the alliance. They won the war and installed Robert Baratheon as the King on the Iron Throne. The army of Lord Walder Frey, Hoster's bannerman, arrived after the Battle of the Trident had already been won by the rebels, causing Hoster to nickname him \"the Late Lord Frey\" to Lord Walder's great irritation.\n\nIn recent years Hoster had become old and frail, losing a great deal of weight. By the beginning of the War of the Five Kings, Hoster had been bedridden for a considerable amount of time from a prolonged illness, and only semi-coherent. His son and heir Edmure took over the day-to-day rule of Riverrun, and Hoster's other duties as overlord of the Riverlands.\n\nLord Hoster finally passed away shortly after the Battle of the Blackwater. Hoster's brother Brynden, son Edmure, daughter Catelyn, and grandson Robb Stark are present for his funeral at Riverrun. As per Tully funeral tradition, his body is set adrift on the Red Fork of the Trident River in a funeral boat, and then set on fire by a flaming arrow - so that his ashes will return to the river which sustains their lands. Brynden tells Catelyn that he and Hoster managed to make peace before his death. Hoster told Brynden to stop calling himself \"The Blackfish\" as it is an old joke and it wasn't very funny to begin with.

As a rule, the wildlings do not capture married women. As Ygritte explains to Jon - who is unaware of this custom - when a man succeeds, it shows that he is strong, brave and cunning, and this is what wildling women seek in men. If the man turns out to be an abusive husband, the wife can always slit his throat."],"name":"Ygritte","description":"Ygritte was a quick-witted and courageous young spearwife. She had red hair and displayed great skill as an archer. Living north of the Wall, she was well skilled in survival and was staunchly loyal to the cause of Mance Rayder. She valued her status as a free woman, and disparaged those living south of the Wall as 'kneelers', who blindly followed hereditary leaders instead of choosing a king.\n\nYgritte believed that because wildlings and Northerners both claim descent from the First Men, there is no need for them to be fighting, and that only the geographical divide of the Wall separates them. As with other wildlings, Ygritte understood that the real threat lies with the impending invasion of the White Walkers.\n\nYgritte was captured by Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand as the sole survivor of their assault on her watchpost. She instructed her captors to burn the bodies of her companions, but Qhorin questioned her motives, thinking that she wanted a fire to attract more wildlings. He then instructs Jon to execute her, telling him to catch up to him after the deed is done. Jon prepares to do so, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Ygritte begs Jon to get it over with and awaits the stroke from his sword, but he hesitates and Ygritte seizes the opportunity to escape. Jon recaptures her, becoming isolated from his brothers in the process. With night approaching, Jon refuses to make a fire, forcing them to sleep out in the cold. Ygritte convinces him to huddle next to her to share body warmth but then makes sexual advances towards him.\n\nAfter a cold night, Jon leads Ygritte along as he tries to find Qhorin Halfhand. On the way she argues with Jon, saying that the North belonged to the Free Folk long before the Andals came. Ygritte tells Jon that, as both Northerners and the Free Folk are descendants of the First Men, there is no sense in the two constantly fighting. After luring Jon off his guard by attempting to seduce him, she manages to escape again and lead him into a wildling ambush.\n\nYgritte brings Jon to the Lord of Bones, who orders him executed. She convinces Rattleshirt that Mance will want to question Jon because of his Stark blood. The Lord of Bones presents Qhorin, whom he had captured. The Halfhand openly blames Jon for the deaths of his men, and this discord intrigues Ygritte. Unbeknownst to Ygritte, Qhorin's outward rage toward Jon is actually a plan to install Jon as a spy within Mance Rayder's army.\n\nDuring their way to meet with Mance Rayder, Ygritte continues to toy with Jon. Qhorin communicates a plan to Jon, through which Jon would appear to desert the Night's Watch and join up with the wildlings. He insists that Jon and he fight and allows Jon to kill him. Ygritte and the rest of the band are stunned, but accept Jon as one of their own and free his hands.\n\nYgritte leads Jon Snow into Mance Rayder's camp in the Frostfang Mountains. Jon is shocked to see a giant among the tents. While the group is walking through the camp to Mance Rayder's tent, some young boys pelt Jon with ice and stones, Ygritte protects him and shoos them away. When they arrive inside Mance Rayder's tent, she ensures his safety and adoption as one of the Free Folk.\n\nYgritte later travels with Jon and Mance as they march slowly south towards the wall. They encounter one of his scouts, Orell. Ygritte is surprised to find that Jon has never seen a warg before. While marching south towards the Wall, Ygritte and the rest of the Free Folk arrive at the Fist of the First Men. They survey the bloody aftermath of the assault on the Night's Watch by the White Walkers and their army of undead wights. Mance orders Ygritte, along with Jon and a group of twenty wildlings led by Tormund, to scale the wall and attack Castle Black from the south. Before leaving the camp she playfully steals Jon's sword and makes him chase her into a nearby grotto. Ygritte starts undressing, and says that she wants to make sure Jon Snow has truly abandoned his vows. She stands before him naked and kisses him. Jon is hesitant at first, but loses himself in his attraction to her and performs cunnilingus on a very surprised Ygritte. After sex, Jon and Ygritte lay together in a naked embrace, and she lovingly teases him about his former virginity. They then leap into the hot springs and Ygritte expresses her reluctance to ever leave the grotto.\n\nSome time later, as the wildlings ready to climb the wall, Ygritte reveals she is aware that Jon is still loyal to the Night's Watch. She understands that he is an honorable man, but warns him that he has obligations to her as well. While climbing, Ygritte causes a massive crack, which dislodges a large sheet of ice and sends several wildlings to their deaths. She and Jon are left hanging by their safety rope. Orell decides that Tormund cannot continue climbing with the weight of Jon and Ygritte's bodies pulling them down, and begins cutting the rope. Jon barely manages to get a hold in the Wall and saves himself and Ygritte when their rope is severed. They reach the top of the Wall and share a passionate kiss, grateful to be alive after such a narrow escape.\n\nYgritte, Jon Snow and the wildlings led by Tormund Giantsbane then make their way towards Castle Black to await Mance Rayder's signal to begin the attack on the Night's Watch. Along the way, Ygritte is confronted by Orell, who expresses his distrust of Jon and says he would make a much better husband. However, he is flatly refused. Later, Jon tries to persuade Ygritte that the wildlings' cause is doomed to failure, but she refuses to listen. She tells him that if they die, they die, but before that, they will live. The two kiss passionately.\n\nLater, the wildling party prepares to raid an elderly horse breeder's home. When the party attacks the farmstead, Jon surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword, alerting the old man and giving him the chance to escape. When Ygritte tries to shoot the fleeing man with an arrow, Jon causes her to miss.\n\nThe old man is later caught in an abandonded windmill. Outside the mill, Orell suggests that Jon prove himself to the wildlings by killing the man himself. Jon is ultimately unable to kill an innocent, and Ygritte shoots him for Jon. Realizing that Jon is still loyal to the Night's Watch, Tormund orders his men to kill the Crow. He also restrains Ygritte to stop her from \"getting [herself] killed\" for her lover's sake. Jon defeats Tormund's men and escapes, leaving Ygritte and heading back to the Wall.\n\nWhen he stops to rest, however, Ygritte catches up to him and, despite his attempts to talk her out of it, shoots him three times before he can get away. She watches him ride away with tears in her eyes, regretting his betrayal of her and also that she could not bring herself to kill the man she loved.\n\nNow awaiting Mance's signal south of the Wall, Ygritte and Tormund rest. Despite wanting revenge for his betrayal, Ygritte still loves Jon, a fact that Tormund picks up on. Ygritte insists that all three arrows found their mark, but says that Jon may still have survived. Knowing Ygritte's skill as a markswoman, Tormund says that if Jon is still alive, it is because she didn't want him dead. A group of Thenns led by Styr arrives, bearing food from a raid farther south. When Styr asks if Ygritte is Tormund's woman, she claims that she belongs to no one and points a threatening arrow at the Thenn leader. He ignores it and takes a seat next to the fire to cook his meat: a human arm.\n\nYgritte and the wildling band attack a village and kill almost all of its inhabitants. She kills one villager with an arrow, whose son Styr orders to run to Castle Black to warn the Night's Watch about the impending attack, in the hopes that the brothers would leave Castle Black to protect nearby villages.\n\nYgritte participates in the attack on Mole's Town. She is ambushed by a whore in the Mole's Town brothel, but swiftly kills her with a spear thrust into her gut. Ygritte then discovers Gilly and her son in hiding, but spares their lives and motions for them to be quiet so they will not be found by other and less merciful wildlings.\n\nJust outside Castle Black, Ygritte gets into a heated argument with Styr over her feelings for Jon, motivating her to resolve to kill him herself and reestablish her tarnished reputation among her own people. The wildlings then see Mance Rayder's bonfire signal to attack Castle Black. Ygritte scouts Castle Black's defenses and reports back that most of the men are on the Wall and few remain in the Castle. The group prepares to attack, while Ygritte seems to have second thoughts. During the battle, she kills numerous brothers of the Night's Watch, including Pypar. Cornering Jon Snow, Ygritte aims an arrow at him. Seeing him and speaking to him weakens her resolve and she hesitates, only to have Olly shoot her through the chest from behind. Jon holds her in his arms, and she weakly asks if he remembers the cave where they made love - where she said she wished they could stay forever and not have to face the war and death outside. Ygritte says they should have stayed in that cave. When Jon insists that they will return there, she tells him \"You know nothing, Jon Snow\" and then dies.\n\nAfter the arrival of Stannis Baratheon at the Wall, Jon speaks with Tormund, who is now a captive of the Night's Watch. Tormund asks Jon if he loved Ygritte, and, when Jon does not respond, says that she loved him very much, as the only thing she talked about after Jon left her, was killing him.

Rather than have his character simply disappear, they decided to give him a proper send-off.","The character of Rakharo is similar, but is older and more seasoned than Jhogo. He has a long, curving mustache and wields the arakh alone in combat. Based on his repeated use of the whip, the Rakharo of the TV series appears to be predominantly based on the Jhogo character from the books."],"name":"Rakharo","description":"Rakharo is a Dothraki warrior who is skilled in combat. He is young, but extremely capable in battle. He was trained by his father, who was a bloodrider in the retinue of a famous khal, Khal Bharbo. He is descended from a long line of bloodriders. He protected Daenerys from her brother's vicious temper and was one of the first to declare her \"blood of my blood.\"\n\nKhal Drogo assigns Rakharo to be the bodyguard of Daenerys Targaryen, Drogo's khaleesi. Their marriage was brokered by her brother Viserys in exchange for Drogo's assistance in reclaiming the Iron Throne for House Targaryen. Drogo takes the khalasar east to Vaes Dothrak. Rakharo discreetly follows Daenerys when she briefly leaves the column to walk in some nearby trees and witnesses her brother Viserys unleashing his rage upon her. Rakharo disables Viserys by whipping him around the throat. At Daenerys's request he spares Viserys, but forces him to walk back to the khalasar by taking his horse. Later, he and Ser Jorah Mormont discuss the relative merits of Dothraki and Westerosi weapons and armor before he gets into a petty argument with Daenerys's handmaiden Irri over what to prepare for dinner. Irri reveals that Daenerys is pregnant and demands the slaughter of a goat.\n\nViserys continues to press Drogo to fulfil his promise immediately and drunkenly threatens Daenerys in front of the khalasar. Rakharo watches as Drogo kills Viserys using a crown of molten gold. Rakharo apprehends an assassin who attempts to poison Daenerys in the markets of Vaes Dothrak after he is exposed by Ser Jorah.\n\nThe assassination attempt causes Drogo to vow to take the Iron Throne for Daenerys. He takes the khalasar south to raid the Lhazareen people to obtain slaves in order to fund the invasion. Rakharo accompanies Daenerys during the Khalasar's raid on a Lhazareen village. Daenerys objects to the dothraki's treatment of the slaves. Rakharo stops the dothraki raping the women. Daenerys' actions provoke dissent and lead to a fight between Drogo and Mago. Drogo easily kills Mago but allows Mago to inflict a small wound while initiating the fight. Drogo's wound festers and he falls from his horse during the journey to sell the Lhazareen slaves. Rakharo stays loyal to Daenerys and carries out her commands even when the other Dothraki begin to blame her for Drogo's decline into illness. Qotho attacks Daenerys and Jorah intervenes, killing Qotho. Daenerys goes into premature labor. Daenerys son dies and Drogo is left in a vegetative state. The Lhazareen maegi Mirri Maz Duur takes responsibility. Daenerys ends Drogo's misery and then builds a funeral pyre for him. She orders Rakharo to place her dragon eggs on the pyre and Jorah to bind Duur within the flames. Daenerys steps into the inferno as her people watch. They stand vigil through the night and in the morning they find her amongst the ashes with three newly hatched dragons. Rakharo joins Ser Jorah in declaring his loyalty to her.\n\nRakharo becomes one of Daenerys bloodriders along with Aggo and Kovarro. Daenerys leads what remains of her khalasar deep into the Red Waste to avoid attack from rival khalasars or retribution from the Lhazareen. Facing starvation she sends Rakharo, Aggo and Kovarro to scout in three different directions, using the last remaining horses. Rakharo is sent North East. Daenerys says goodbye to him personally and tells him that he has never failed her. He says that it is a bad time to start.\n\nRakharo's horse returns to the khalasar without him. Jorah Mormont approaches the horse to find Rakharo's decapitated head in a bag (along with his cut braid of hair, to mark his defeat), speculating he might have been killed by Khals Pono or Jhaqo to show their contempt for a female leading a khalasar. Irri, who was in love with Rakharo, is distraught because, according to Dothraki belief, his spirit won't be able to move on to the Night Lands - the afterlife - to ride with his ancestors.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rakharo"}}

His house is noted for its overwhelming fertility and he has over one hundred descendants. He rules The Twins and its surrounding lands, controlling the strategically important crossing of the Green Fork. Over the years, this great stone bridge and the castles that control it have made House Frey a fortune in crossing fees. Lord Walder been married seven times and is almost ninety years old when the series begins.","When Robb Stark's army arrives at the Twins on its march south, Robb needs to cross the river to gain a tactical advantage over the Lannister forces. As a Tully bannerman, Walder Frey had been called up, but he had delayed going until he saw which side had the advantage. Now that Riverrun is besieged by the Lannisters, Frey wonders why he should risk their fury. Catelyn tells Robb that Walder Frey is slippery and not to be trusted, despite his allegiance to her father. Fearing that Walder would attempt to imprison Robb and sell him to the Lannisters, Catelyn volunteers to negotiate with him.","In response to Robb's plea for men to help him capture Casterly Rock, Lord Walder sends his sons Lothar and Black Walder to Riverrun to discuss the terms of a new alliance with him. Lord Walder demands Harrenhal, as well as the marriage between Edmure Tully and his daughter Roslin.","Lord Walder and the rest of House Frey are now the focus of distaste and hatred by the North and the Riverlands for their part in the Red Wedding, especially since the Riverlands have fallen into disarray and lawlessness since they were granted to the Freys by the Lannisters. None of House Tully's vassals accept Lord Walder as their new liege lord. A farmer avows that Lord Walder himself committed sacrilege by sharing bread and salt with the Starks and Tullys before slaughtering them, and that he will \"burn in the seventh Hell\" for it.","Walder learns of the capture of Riverrun and the rising of the other Riverlands houses from Lame Lothar and Black Walder, which sends him into a fury. He accosts them for allowing Brynden to escape the Red Wedding alive in the first place, and demands they take back Riverrun. To do so, they will use the captive Edmure.

As Walder's many sons drink from their chalices, Arya refuses to let any of the women partake, aware of their innocence. She then elicits cheers from the many Frey sons upon the mention of the infamous Red Wedding, though then goes on to subtlety mock them by reminding them of how they butchered a pregnant woman, cut the throat of a mother of five, and slaughtered the Starks after inviting them into their home. As the Frey sons begin to cough up blood from the poison, Arya watches with satisfaction as they all die before removing her mask and revealing herself. Before leaving, she asks Walder's wife, Kitty Frey, to tell anyone that might ask what happened that \"the north remembers\", and remarks that winter has come for House Frey.","In the books, Lord Walder isn't named the new Lord of Riverrun after the Red Wedding.

He openly admits how little he thinks of the oaths he swears to other houses due to his strategic position, which he uses to extort hefty tolls in exchange for his allegiance, and shows a willingness to switch sides if he thinks it will benefit him more. Walder may see to it that his numerous progeny, trueborn and baseborn alike, are provided for but shows them little to no regard (as shown when he couldn't even remember his granddaughter Merry's name) as he basically uses them to further assert his own position. In truth, his ire towards Robb after he broke his vow had nothing whatsoever to do with any slight to his daughters and granddaughters but rather to his house.\n\nDespite his advanced age, however, Walder shows little thought or concern for what happens to his house after he dies because like other individuals, namely Cersei Lannister and Ramsay Bolton, he is extremely self-centered, not fully considering the long-term consequences of his actions. In addition, Walder Frey is extremely callous. When he meets Jaime Lannister, he speaks with the man as if they are equals (although Jaime has personally killed many men while Walder merely sat and watched as others died), calling himself a conqueror. He also credited himself as a kingslayer like Jaime for his involvement in the Red Wedding, even though it had been Roose Bolton who had killed Robb Stark. Walder Frey had barely even got up from his seat during the massacre, and yet he credited himself with the deaths of greater men and women than himself.\n\nJaime is quick to point this out, and the fact that Walder views his house as a feared one for eliminating the Tullys on two occasions, even though he is simply loathed. Furthermore, he required very considerable support from Tywin Lannister for the Red Wedding, and he did not participate personally in taking Riverrun. Walder gloated that Brynden Tully had fallen to foot soldiers, even though he had never personally stepped into combat, considering generally defeating one's enemy to be a victory - the very fact that he considered himself (an old man who called for the aid of stronger people to achieve his victories) to be on par with Jaime Lannister (who actually killed his king and was trained by heroes, and has participated in actual battles) shows that Walder is narrow-minded. He considers the fact that his enemies are dead and he is not to be a personal victory, and he acts like a strong, respected man and a crucial ally, when he is not essentially a valued ally of the Lannisters.\n\nIn his final moments, however, Walder's swagger crumbles instantly when he is caught off guard by Arya with no one to protect him, and he shows his cowardice when he attempts to flee before she kills him, proving Tyrion Lannister right when he said that Walder was many things but not brave.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Walder_Frey"}}

About a thousand years ago (perhaps 700 years before the Targaryen Conquest), the Rhoynar were on the verge of being conquered by the expanding power of the Valyrian Freehold and its dragons. Defeated at the end of the Rhoynish Wars, Nymeria rallied the survivors and fled Essos altogether, sailing in a refugee fleet said to include ten thousand ships. After much wandering she eventually led her people to Dorne, at the southeastern tip of Westeros. After landing, Nymeria had all of the Rhoynar's 10,000 ships burned, so that none would have second thoughts about staying.\n\nAt the time, Dorne was divided into many petty kingdoms and had never been unified. Impressed by Nymeria, local king Mors Martell married her and united her forces with his own. Together, they conquered and unified all of Dorne for the first time, reigning from the Martell's seat at Sunspear. At some point later, she would marry Davos Dayne. Dorne was the last of the Seven Kingdoms to join the realm; however, it did not join through conquest, but rather through marriage two centuries later.\n\nThe Dornish revere Nymeria as the founder of their realm, and her descendants in House Martell continued to rule Dorne through the present day. As a result, \"Nymeria\" actually became a common name in Dorne (comparable to how \"Brandon\" is a very common name in the North, after their founder, Brandon Stark the Builder). Oberyn Martell - himself a direct descendant of Nymeria, warrior-queen of the Rhoynar - named one of his own bastard daughters Nymeria Sand. Nymeria's fame also spread across Westeros: even young Arya Stark, fascinated with legends about past warrior-queens, chose to name her direwolf \"Nymeria\".\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Nymeria"}}

Aerys was infamously murdered by a member of his own Kingsguard, Ser Jaime Lannister, during Lord Tywin Lannister's Sack of King's Landing. This act earned Ser Jaime the nickname \"Kingslayer\" for slaying the king that he was sworn to protect as a member of the Kingsguard.","King Aerys was betrayed by his former friend and King's Hand, Lord Tywin Lannister, who led an army under the false pretense of defending the capital at King's Landing.

These brutal actions lead to a revolt that toppled the Targaryen dynasty. Daenerys insists she is not like her father, which Barristan agreed. Still, he states that like Daenerys, her father had ordered these brutalities because he too felt he was dispensing \"justice\" and it made him feel powerful and right, until the very end.","While still looking into the past and fleeing from the White Walkers, Bran Stark sees the Mad King's final hours as king in the waning days of Robert's Rebellion.

The last straw came when Aerys appointed Tywin's eldest son and heir Jaime Lannister to his Kingsguard. Normally this was the highest honor a knight could achieve, and Jaime himself was eager to accept, but it meant that Jaime had to forsake all claims as Tywin's heir (leaving his stunted and hated younger son Tyrion as his heir). Privately, Aerys had truly agreed to promote Jaime to the Kingsguard to keep him around the royal court at all times, essentially as an unwitting hostage in case Tywin ever decided to turn on him. Outraged by the continual insults he endured from Aerys, Tywin resigned as Hand of the King on some thin pretext; the Hands that followed were a succession of Aerys's cronies, who he later turned on for various failures, exiling or executing them depending on his whims."],"name":"Aerys II Targaryen","description":"Of all the Kings to sit on the Iron Throne, none induced a level of tyranny, madness and especially cruelty as Aerys Targaryen did during his rule. Dubbed the Mad King, Aerys seemingly began as a benevolent ruler until he was overwhelmed by the so-called \"Targaryen madness\" brought on by an incestuous bloodline. As a result, he began displaying traits of intense psychopathy, insanity and sadistic intentions, exacerbated by hallucinations, schizophrenia and paranoia regarding his own claim to the Throne, to the point where he burnt anyone he believed was against him, until half of the people whom he ruled were already against him.\n\nLike many Targaryens, such as his son Viserys, Aerys was obsessed with the self-conception that he was a dragon in human skin. In regards to this, he killed his victims in a similar manner that which a dragon would; burning them alive. Jaime Lannister once observed that he loved watching them char until their skin blackened, indicating he may have suffered from pyromanica and this combined with sadism and hopeless delusions, spurred his already oppressive reign into complete tyranny. In a final bid where it appeared Robert Baratheon would take King's Landing, Aerys planted wildfire throughout the city, even the Red Keep where Aerys himself was staying. Not for one second, however, did he believe that it would result in his death, like his uncle Prince Aerion Targaryen, who killed himself by drinking wildfire. Instead, he thought he would be reborn as a dragon through a baptism by fire and burn his enemies in retribution.\n\nAerys's perceived lack of sanity and rational thinking seemingly caused his own death. Instead of listening to Varys or Jaime who warned him that Tywin Lannister possessed an ulterior motive when promising to defend his city for him, he only listened to the extremely sycophantic Grand Maester Pycelle who told him only what he wanted to hear. When he saw that Tywin tricked him, he foolishly ordered Jaime to execute his own father, confident that he would do so as no Kingsguard had ever disobeyed him before. Just before his death, however, Aerys showed shock and fear for the first time under his rule as Jaime approached him after killing his pyromancer. He even attempted to flee, proving that even he feared what all other tyrants cannot control nor escape: death.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Aerys_II_Targaryen"}}

She is present when Margaery notifies Mira of Cersei's suspicion towards her and her house, and announces to the Throne Room Mira and Margaery's arrival.\n\nAfterwards, Sera asks Mira how it went, before the two joke about the various men present at court. Sera states that she wouldn't mind marrying Joffrey if it would mean she could be queen. Depending on the player's choice, Mira can either appease Margaery for assistance for her house with or without Sera in presence. Later on if Sera is allowed to stay and listen to Mira's proposal she is sympathetic and asks if she can help, if she is told to leave she is upset and questions her friendship with Mira.\n\nWhile Mira is writing letters for the royal wedding when Sera enters the room and asks to speak with Mira.\n\nLater Mira and Sera walk in the gardens around King's Landing, and Sera leads Mira to a seating area, where she reveals she has a cask of Arbor red wine from Cersei's favorite stock. Mira has the choice whether to drink some of the wine or not. Sera reveals to Mira she is in fact a bastard, and her true name is actually Sera Flowers. During their talk they are interrupted by Tyrion Lannister, who questions them about the source of the wine, knowing how expensive an Arbor red is and Cersei certainly did not give it to them. He warns the handmaidens that if Cersei found that they had the wine she would drown them in it, and directs his attention to Mira, discussing ironwood dealings. Mira leaves with Tyrion, leaving Sera to drink the wine.\n\nSera is seen walking with Mira in the gardens speaking of her excitement of the wedding as it will be a good chance for her to find a husband. While they're walking they see Lord Morgryn speaking to a man called Garibald Tarwick, Sera asks Mira to cover for her while she goes to speak to him, after she finishes she notices Mira talking to Tom ask thinks that they were romantically involved much to Mira's surprise, they then start walking to the throne room while Sera starts telling Mira about Garibald.\n\nWhen Sera and Mira arrive in the throne room they see Margeary talking to Cersei Lannister about last minute details regarding the wedding, including that Margeary's handmaidens are not going to be able to attend the feast much to Sera's horror, when Cersei tells Margeary that Mira and Tyrion have been speaking to each other Margeary is greatly annoyed by this and gets Sera to help her prepare for the wedding instead of Mira.\n\nAt the wedding Sera tells Mira that Margaery is furious and is considering having Mira replaced, Sera offers to help Mira and if Mira accepts then Sera promises to do what she can.\n\nSera makes her first appearance of the episode when Mira attempts to sneak into Tommen's Coronation Feast. Sera, who is walking with Lord Tarwick, is shocked to be approached by Mira since she was not invited. Excusing herself from Tarwick, Sera listens as Mira asks for Sera's help sneaking into the Feast. Sera is initially not willing to put her relationship with Margaery on the line and warns Mira that Margaery is still angry with her, but soon relents.\n\nSera nods to the guard, explaining that Mira is with her. The two girls are let in. After a brief conversation between her, Mira, and Tarwick, Sera and Tarwick will continue their conversation on a bench. When Margaery makes her way to the Feast, Sera saves Mira just in time from being noticed by greeting Margaery. The two of them can be overheard talking about Mira, where Sera attempts to get Margaery to forgive Mira. Margaery asks Sera to consider why she should put in so much effort for Mira, when Mira potentially would not do as much for her. Sera says nothing, looking down thoughtfully.\n\nLord Tarwick will later approach Mira, suspicious of Sera's last name, Durwell, because House Durwell went extinct 200 years prior. Mira can either lie for Sera, vouching for her family's authenticity, or reveal the truth about her background. If Mira is to lie, Tarwick will officially court Sera, and begin to make marriage preparations. If the truth is revealed, Tarwick will cancel any plans of marrying Sera.\n\nMira stands in the Red Keep and looks out to the Blackwater Bay when Sera approaches her and states that she hasn't seen Mira since the coronation feast. Mira abruptly asks how many ships Sera believes would take to move an army. Sera is confused why Mira would want to know this, but Mira shrugs it off quickly.\n\nSera begins to recall the coronation feast, and how she took an enormous risk defying Margaery getting Mira into it, and how the scene Mira made with Lord Andros didn't help. She notes that Margaery noticed, and knew how Mira got in. Sera believes Mira gave Andros a good reason to yell, as she does with everyone including Margaery.\n\nSera finishes that because of that, it's no longer safe to be around Mira anymore. She points out that Mira isn't the girl she knew at Highgarden, who would never be so reckless. She either states that depending on if you revealed Sera's bastardy to Lord Tarwick or not, Garibald and her are discussing marriage and she can't risk the marriage, or that he is refusing to talk to her and Margaery is her only protection, as a reason why she can't associate with Mira.\n\nSera apologizes, and the pair walk down the hallway, then asks if it was worth it, sacrificing so much for her family. They come round a corner to see Lady Margaery talking with some other noblewomen, and states she needs to go before she is spotted by her, when two Lannister guards surround Mira, Sera slips out.\n\nMira enters Margaery's room to find that Margaery has discovered Sera's act of stealing wine from Cersei. Sera begs Margaery to let her stay on as a handmaiden and not send her back to Highgarden. Margaery then turns to Mira and tells her that Sera has accused Mira of using her to get into the Garden Party. The player then has a choice: they can claim that Sera did this of her own accord or take the blame. If the former is chosen, Sera shouts at Mira for her act of betrayal and is dismissed by Margaery. If the latter is chosen, Mira is dismissed by Maragaery and Sera follows her from the room, thanking her for accepting responsibility. She then informs Mira that somebody has been spreading rumours about her being responsible for the disappearance of a missing Lannister guard. With that Sera bids farewell to Mira and returns to Lady Margaery.\n\nShould Mira choose to be executed in order to save Tom, Sera appears again later in the episode at Mira's execution. If the player lost Sera her place with Margaery, she will hurl rotten fruit at Mira's head. If the player helped Sera win back Margaery's trust, Sera merely watches the event with a sad expression on her face.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sera_Durwell"}}

During their walk, Sansa tries to remind Loras of their first meeting at the Hand's Tourney many months before. Although Loras has clearly forgotten about it, he plays along to avoid insulting her.

But that does not make him wise.\"","Loras's grandmother, Olenna Tyrell congratulates Brienne of Tarth for besting her grandson during the melee at King Renly's camp, describing him as a \"silly little boy\".","During Tywin's funeral, Loras attempts to approach Cersei, speaking of how supposedly fearsome Tywin was, but Cersei ignores him and stalks off. At night, Loras is cuddling with Olyvar post coitus, discussing the possibility of visiting Dorne or anywhere far away from King's Landing, when Margaery walks in. She admonishes Loras for making them late for supper with King Tommen. After Olyvar has taken his leave Margaery urges her brother to be more discreet especially in the Red Keep. Loras no longer cares as he knows everybody is whispering about him anyway. Loras is puzzled by Margaery's relaxed attitude, as Tywin's death means Cersei won't be forced to marry Loras and be sent off with him to Highgarden, which means Margaery will have to contend with her mother-in-law at the capital. Margaery implies that may not be the case.","Margaery is permitted to visit Loras in prison. He is worn out and beaten down by the Faith Militant's treatment of him.

A prodigiously skilled warrior and an extremely popular young man, he is shown to be gracious towards everyone around him and grateful whenever someone does him a favor. He was quick to thank Sandor Clegane when the latter saved Loras's life from his ferocious brother, Gregor, and showed his appreciation by declaring him champion without having a joust. However, Loras was also rather spoiled to a fault, which could have arguably played a role in his downfall. Renly pointed this out to Loras by the expensive and extravagant suit of armor that his father procured for him to wear at tournaments. Loras also shows a hint of his grandmother's influence when he mocked Robb Stark for \"hiding behind his mother's skirts\" as opposed to appearing in person to treat with Renly and Jaime Lannister for his incest when the latter tried to intimidate Loras into calling of his engagement to Cersei Lannister.\n\nLoras thought that Renly Baratheon would have been a wonderful king because he didn't enjoy killing like Robert did, and he was extremely popular unlike Stannis. When Renly was murdered, Loras correctly deduced it was Stannis and furiously vowed that he would personally execute the man, briefly ignoring the fact that the odds were against him being able to do so. One other unfortunate weakness in Loras was his lack of discretion. He eagerly engaged with Olyvar upon meeting him, despite Margaery's warnings that people could find out about it, and gave little thought to the possibility that their relationship might be used against him. Still, due to the protection afforded him all his life as the heir to Highgarden, Loras reacted with arrogant aggression when Lancel Lannister and the Faith Militant arrested him. He was also rather quick to leave along with his grandmother and sister after lying to the High Sparrow about his relationship with Renly at his inquest. Only when the Sparrows call Olyvar forward to testify does Loras begin to show genuine fear that all his lies, including the one he just told the High Sparrow, were finally catching up with him, and they do when Olyvar betrays Loras by giving irrefutable evidence of their relationship to the High Sparrow. His imprisonment by the Faith Militant demoralized Loras to the point that he was willing to publicly renounce all he once held dear and humble himself before the High Sparrow in order to be released (strikingly similar to what happened to Theon Greyjoy during his imprisonment by Ramsay Bolton).\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Loras_Tyrell"}}

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred. These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon, Balerion the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n\nAt the end of Robert's Rebellion, during the Sack of King's Landing, as the Lannister army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King Aerys II Targaryen - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with hidden caches of wildfire. To prevent this, his own Kingsguard Ser Jaime Lannister killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself. Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throneroom, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n\nSepta Mordane quizzes Sansa Stark on her history lessons while walking through the throneroom, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n\nBecause the king is out hunting, Eddard Stark sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a peasant refugee that Ser Gregor Clegane has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n\nFollowing the death of King Robert Baratheon, his alleged son Joffrey Baratheon takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n\nFar away on the eastern continent in Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys Targaryen urges her husband Khal Drogo to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the Dothraki it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son, Rhaego.\n\nJoffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the War of the Five Kings tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive Sansa Stark with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court. Meanwhile, at Dragonstone Island to the east, Robert's younger brother Stannis Baratheon declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Blackwater, just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son Tommen sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give Essence of Nightshade to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser Loras Tyrell: the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from House Tyrell arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n\nOlenna Tyrell, in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n\nPetyr Baelish remarks to Varys that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is in fact illusory.\n\nFollowing Joffrey's assassination with poison at his own wedding, his younger brother Tommen Baratheon is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne. Because Tommen is still underaged, however, his grandfather, Hand of the King, and regent Tywin Lannister later sits on the Iron Throne, while overseeing the Trial of Tyrion Lannister for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n\nAfter a new alliance between the crown and the Faith Militant, Tommen Baratheon dismisses his beloved uncle, Jaime Lannister, from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne. The Iron Throne also appears later when King Tommen outlaws trial by combat and announces the date of Cersei and Loras' trials. Petyr Baelish addresses Sansa Stark his desire to sit on the Throne.

He was formally styled as Aenys of House Targaryen, the First of His Name.","With Aegon I, Rhaenys, and Orys dead, Dowager Queen Visenya became the last of the Conquest-generation of Targaryens, and she did much to aid her son Maegor's rise in power. Aenys even gave Maegor the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of House Targaryen, Blackfyre, which had been carried by their father - openly acknowledging that Maegor was a better warrior than he ever was. Maegor was frustrated by his inability to produce an heir in his arranged marriage to the High Septon's niece, however, who would never grant him a separation - so Maegor polygamously took a second wife, angering the Faith so much that Aenys had to exile him to Pentos."],"name":"Aenys Targaryen","description":"King Aegon the Conqueror had two children by his two sister-wives: his firstborn son Aenys with his sister Queen Rhaenys, and his second-born son Maegor with his sister Queen Visenya. When Aegon I eventually died, Aenys succeeded him as the second king on the Iron Throne.\n\nThe Conquest was still within living memory, however, and many still chafed under Targaryen rule - and saw the death of Aegon I as an opportunity to throw off their rule. Several localized rebellions therefore broke out at the beginning of Aensys's reign, such as the insurrection of the \"Vulture King\" in the Red Mountains along the border with independent Dorne, but these uprisings were ultimately put down - not really due to Aenys's leadership, but capable local rulers such as House Tarly, among others.\n\nThe Targaryens had incestuously married brother to sister for generations (whenever possible) to \"keep the bloodline pure\", in the custom of their Valyrian ancestors - which the Faith of the Seven in Westeros considered an abomination. For that matter, Aegon I broke not only the Faith's rules against incest, but its rules against polygamy, as he was married to both of his sisters at the same time.  The Faith wasn't in much position to challenge the victorious Targaryen army after the Conquest, or their massive dragons, but Aegon I was wise enough to tread lightly with the Faith: both sides tacitly agreed that the Targaryens' incestuous marriages were a relic of their past, which would soon fade. Aegon I didn't intend for future generations of his new dynasty to continue to have incestuous marriages, and in return, the Faith didn't press the matter for the remainder of his life. Aegon I eventually died and was succeeded by his elder son, Aenys.\n\nTo the surprise of all, however, later in his reign King Aenys tactlessly wed his daughter to his own son: the incestuous marriage of Princess Rhaena and Prince Aegon broke the Targaryens' prior promise to the Faith, which could stand the abomination no longer. The new High Septon led the denunciation of the Targaryens, and the military order of the Faith of the Seven, the Faith Militant, rose up in open revolt. King Aenys proved to be an utter weakling in the face of the revolt and was completely overwhelmed. As the Faith Militant attacked lords that still supported him across the Seven Kingdoms, one particularly zealous force of the order even managed to scale the walls of the (still under construction) Red Keep, and would have killed Aenys and the royal family if not for the intervention of the Kingsguard. Frightened, Aenys fled King's Landing entirely and retreated to the Targaryen fortress-refuge at Dragonstone - where he soon died of cramps brought on from the stress.\n\nInstead of his own children, Aenys was then succeeded by his younger half-brother Maegor, Aegon I's only child by Visenya. Maegor was his brother's exact opposite: a highly skilled warrior and brutal tyrant, quickly earning him the name \"Maegor the Cruel\".\n\nMaegor ultimately died childless, however, and Aenys's youngest son succeeded to the throne as King Jaehaerys I: hence all subsequent Targaryen monarchs descended from Aenys, not Maegor.\n\nAenys's name is briefly seen on a page of the book \"The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms\" when Lord Eddard Stark is searching through it. On a page about House Baratheon, it is mentioned that one of Orys Baratheon's sons, a member of the Kingsguard, died thwarting an assassination attempt against Aenys.\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aenys was the first son of Aegon the Conqueror and Queen Rhaenys, before she died fighting in Dorne. Maegor, meanwhile, was the son and only child of Queen Visenya, Aegon's other sister-wife, making him Aenys's half-brother.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin made Targaryen dynasty names by mix-and-matching different name elements: \"Ae-\" in \"Aegon\", \"Aemon\", \"Aemond\", \"Aerion\", etc., and the suffix \"-nys\" from \"Rhaenys\" (less clearly, \"Viserys\" and \"Daenerys\"). In-universe, Aenys's name is apparently simply a combination of his parents' names: \"Ae-gon\" and \"Rhae-nys\" yielded \"Ae-nys\". It is pronounced like both elements in his parents' names: \"AY-nis\", but not \"Ay-nus\".\n\nAenys was considered to be a weakling. He was as tall as his father but softer looking, slender and frail. He was very sickly as a child. His mother Rhaenys died when he was only three years old, which deeply traumatized him. He grew somewhat stronger and more confident after bonding to his dragon Quicksilver (progeny of the original three dragons brought to Westeros during the Conquest). Like his mother, Aenys enjoyed court life and was a great patron of the arts: he was dabbler in poetry and alchemy, though not much of an academic. Nonetheless he was quite charming on a personal level at court, in contrast with his brutish younger half-brother. He wore his hair long down to his shoulders, curled into ringlets and perfumed. He also had a thin silky moustache and beard, well-manicured to come to a fine point (described as a \"Three Musketeers\" look by Martin). He wore a large gold crown much bigger than his father's simple band of Valyrian steel interlaid with large square-cut rubies. Despite being a courtier, he was not very charismatic in times of actual crisis, as those around him became disgusted at his weak will and indecision. He had a nervous smile, as if anxious and eager to please those around him.\n\nAenys wasn't a completely foppish incompetent (this reputation became somewhat exaggerated over time): he did well enough at jousting and feats of arms not to embarrass himself, he wasn't just tripping over his sword, but he was only adequate - in contrast with the great legacy of his father. Aenys might have made a decent enough caretaker king if he had inherited the throne in a time of peace - he may not have been a great statesman but he wasn't outright insane (like Aerys II), a religious buffoon (like Baelor I), or a cruel tyrant (as Maegor later became). The Targaryen dynasty was still young, however, and needed a forceful king to cement its status - and Aenys failed to rise to the occasion.\n\nBecause Aegon I didn't want to antagonize the Faith, he tacitly agreed not to continue the Targaryen custom of incestous marriage. Combined with the fact that Aegon simply never produced any daughters, he made Aenys wed Alyssa Velaryon as a political marriage (she was still a cousin given that the Targaryens had frequently intermarried with the Velaryons, but cousin marriage isn't considered incest in Westeros). Aenys and Alyssa had three sons and two daughters, who in order were: Rhaena, Aegon, Viserys, Jaehaerys, and Alysanne. Their sixth and final child was a daughter named Vaella, but she died in the cradle.\n\nThe construction of the Red Keep took many years and Aegon I only lived to see the foundations set: instead he spent much of his long reign on royal progresses across Westeros with an itinerant court, knitting together his newly forged kingdom. He kept Aenys by his side at his mobile royal court, while Maegor stayed behind on Dragonstone.\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Aenys_Targaryen"}}

The hypocrisy in this is that Tywin himself married for love when he wed his own first cousin Joanna, instead of entering into a marriage-alliance with another powerful noble family.

Joanna was perhaps the only person Tywin loved unconditionally. Joanna bore him the twins Jaime and Cersei. She died giving birth to Tyrion. Joanna died when Cersei and Jaime were only four years old. Tywin took Joanna's death very hard, as did Cersei, who holds Tyrion responsible for her death. However, Jaime understands that Tyrion was just an infant and had no control over what happened.\n\nWhen Tyrion arrives in King's Landing to serve as acting Hand of the King, Cersei is annoyed at how he is checking her power, and his quips that she is not ruling wisely. At one point she bitterly says that he is funny, but nothing will ever match his first joke: killing her mother in childbirth when he came out of her. The greatest joke of all is that she had to die so something as worthless as him could live. Tyrion is hurt and coldly reminds her that she was his mother too.\n\nJoanna's brother, Stafford Lannister, is briefly mentioned by Lancel Lannister as having been killed at the Battle of Oxcross.\n\nCersei explains to Sansa Stark that when she was four and her mother died, she prayed for days hoping the gods would give her mother back until her father explained that prayer could not do that.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Blackwater, Tyrion (who was seriously injured in the battle but recovered) came to his father in the Tower of the Hand. He asked that as a basic reward for loyal service, his father grant him rule of Casterly Rock itself, given that Tywin would be remaining in King's Landing as Hand of the King. Tyrion pointed out that by all laws it was his right, given that his older brother Jaime foreswore all right to inheritance when he joined the Kingsguard. Tywin refuses and when Tyrion asks why, he launches into a bitter tirade saying that he shouldn't need to explain something so obvious: Tyrion's mother died so he could enter the world, and on top of that he is a stunted dwarf whose very existence is a shame to their family. Tywin always hated Tyrion for \"killing\" his beloved wife.\n\nAfter the Red Wedding, Tyrion confronts Tywin after a Small Council meeting about his plans to force Tyrion to impregnate Sansa Stark, which he says is for the good of the Lannister family. Tyrion counters by demanding to know when Tywin ever did something \"for the family\", putting the family's interests above and at the expense of his own. Wounded and choking back anger, Tywin bluntly declares that the day Tyrion was born and his mother died in childbirth, he was so stricken with grief that he wanted to carry Tyrion into the sea and let him drown but stayed his hand because Tyrion is a Lannister and Tywin refused to become a kinslayer. Therefore, he earnestly believes that Tyrion should be outright grateful for this as if it were a deep personal sacrifice: that Tywin refrained from killing his own infant son.\n\nWhen Tyrion demands a trial by combat to prove his innocence in the killing of his nephew, King Joffrey, he is visited by Oberyn Martell, who regales him with a tale of their first encounter when Tyrion was just a baby, and how even then Cersei showed her hatred for Tyrion as she irrationally blamed him for Joanna's death.\n\nWhen Jaime shows his disgust with Cersei for having Tyrion falsely convicted and sentenced to die for killing their son Joffrey, Cersei irrationally justifies her actions on the grounds that he killed their mother too, which exasperates Jaime even more. Although Jaime reciprocates when Cersei kisses him passionately, he later defies his sister when he goes down to the cells and frees Tyrion. Before setting eyes on his brother, Tyrion grumpily calls him a \"son of a whore\", to which Jaime replies, \"Is that any way to speak about our mother?\"\n\nWhen Daenerys asks Tyrion why she shouldn't kill him for what his family did to hers, he answers: \"You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister, on the day I was born. I killed my father, Tywin Lannister, with a bolt to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister-killer of all time.\"\n\n","type":"class ceat.icr.FanWikiCharacter","url":"https:\/\/gameofthrones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Joanna_Lannister"}}
